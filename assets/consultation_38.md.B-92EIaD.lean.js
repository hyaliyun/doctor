The situation not only represents a significant health risk but has resulted in school closures that have disrupted agricultural education. This impedes the attainment of Africa's larger food security and rural transformation agendas. Six months before the advent of the pandemic, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture initiated a pilot project, Start Them Early Program (STEP) whose goal is to reinforce pathways to careers in agriculture within secondary schools in DR Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria. The project has now been forced to rethink its approach while embracing information and communication technologies due to the school closures. This paper describes the process involved in that operational pivot, particularly concerning the shift from electronic teaching by instructors towards distance electronic learning by students. Key issues addressed are the consolidation of digital applications, development of a mobile-based toolbox for use by young farmers, and constraints to device ownership. The means of addressing these concerns through working with instructors and their larger school systems are explained. Action points and resources that are recommended include the distribution of upgraded instructor workstations, a listing of relevant software applications, and the design of a mobile-based all-in-one toolkit for agriculture students and young farmers. The latter two developments have wider application in the reform of agricultural extension amongst the tech-savvy youth taking up agribusiness.","output":"An ICT strategy based upon e-teaching and e-learning in response to the COVID-19 crisis in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has propelled the rapid development of serological tests that can detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These have been used for studying the prevalence and spread of infection in different populations, helping establish a diagnosis of COVID-19, and will likely be used to confirm humoral immunity after infection or vaccination. However, nearly all lab-based high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serological assays require a serum sample from venous blood draw, limiting their applications and scalability. Here, we present a method that enables large scale SARS-CoV-2 serological studies by combining self or office collection of fingerprick blood with an FDA-approved dried blood spot collection device (Neoteryx Mitra(R)) with a high-throughput electrochemiluminescence-based SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay (Roche Elecsys(R)) that is EUA approved for use on serum samples and widely used by clinical laboratories around the world. We found that the Roche Elecsys(R) assay has a high dynamic range that allows for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:20 as well as contrived dried blood extracts. Extracts of dried blood from Neoteryx Mitra(R) devices acquired in a community seroprevalence study showed near identical sensitivity and specificity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as compared to neat sera using predefined thresholds for each specimen type. Overall, this study affirms the use of Neoteryx Mitra(R) dried blood collection device with the Roche Elecsys(R) SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay for remote or at-home testing as well as large-scale community seroprevalence studies.","output":"Remote fingerstick blood collection for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The humoral innate immune response consists of multiple components, including the naturally occurring antibodies (NAb), pentraxins and the complement and contact cascades.

Thereby, in German companies, the adoption of infection control and OSH measures highly depends on different company characteristics. Materials and Methods: We employ data from the 2nd and the 16th survey round of the study Establishments in the Covid-19 crisis (BeCovid), a German representative establishment survey of approximately 2,000 companies in several branches. Both survey rounds, conducted in August/September 2020 and August 2021, focus on infection control measures and health and safety regulations. The latter further includes questions concerning future challenges for OSH. Results: The results show that a large variety of different measures helped to provide infection control and OSH during the crisis. Larger companies not only adopted more measures, but also were more likely to implement measures also concerning psychological health of employees. While the majority of all companies plan to consider OSH in future management decisions, again mainly larger companies are going to invest in digital tools to provide OSH in the future.

Public protective measures were enforced in every country to limit the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2. Its transmission, mainly by droplets, has been measured by the effective reproduction number (Rt) that counts the number of secondary cases caused in a population by an average infectious individual at time t. Current strategies to calculate Rt reflect the number of secondary cases after several days, due to a delay from symptoms onset to reporting. We propose a complementary Rt estimation using supervised machine learning techniques to predict short term variations with more timely results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our primary goal was to predict Rt of the current day in the twelve provinces of Lombardy with the highest possible accuracy, and with no influence of the local testing strategies. We gathered data about mobility, weather, and pollution from different public sources as a proxy of human behavior and public health measures. We built four supervised machine learning algorithms with different strategies: the outcome variable was the daily median Rt values per province obtained from officially adopted algorithms. RESULTS: Data from 243 days for every province were presented to our four models (from February 15th, 2020, to October 14th, 2020). Two models using differential calculation of Rt instead of the raw values showed the highest mean coefficient of determination (0.93 for both) and residuals reported the lowest mean error (-0.03 and 0.01) and standard deviation (0.13 for both) as well. The one with access to the value of Rt of the day before heavily relied on that feature for prediction, while the other one had more distributed weights. DISCUSSION: The model that had not access to the Rt value of the previous day and used Rt differential value as outcome (FDRt) was considered the most robust according to the metrics. Its forecasts were able to predict the trend that Rt values would have developed over different weeks, but it was not particularly accurate in predicting the precise value of Rt. A correlation among mobility, atmospheric, features, pollution and Rt values is plausible, but further testing should be performed.","output":"Early prediction of SARS-CoV-2 reproductive number from environmental, atmospheric and mobility data: A supervised machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has caused a worldwide pandemic because of the virus's ability to transmit efficiently human-to-human. A key determinant of infection is the attachment of the viral spike protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Because of the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, there is no practical way to assess the susceptibility of every species to SARS-CoV-2 by direct challenge studies. In an effort to have a better predictive model of animal host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, we expressed the ACE2 and/or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes from humans and other animal species in the avian fibroblast cell line, DF1, that is not permissive to infection. We demonstrated that expression of both human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes is necessary to support SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in DF1 and a non-permissive sub-lineage of MDCK cells. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 in these cell lines were comparable to those observed in control Vero cells. To further test the model, we developed seven additional transgenic cell lines expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 derived from Felis catus (cat), Equus caballus (horse), Sus domesticus (pig), Capra hircus (goat), Mesocricetus auratus (Golden hamster), Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown bat) and Hipposideros armiger (Great Roundleaf bat) in DF1 cells. Results demonstrate permissive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cat, Golden hamster, and goat species, but not pig or horse, which correlated with the results of reported challenge studies. Cells expressing genes from either bat species tested demonstrated temporal replication of SARS-CoV-2 that peaked early and was not sustained. The development of this cell culture model allows for more efficient testing of the potential susceptibility of many different animal species for SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variant viruses.","output":"Development of an in vitro model for animal species susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication based on expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in avian cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound effect on mental health and it is therefore fundamental to evaluate individual psychological responses to COVID-19.

Social distancing rules and the fear of infection have greatly reduced face-to-face interactions, increased loneliness, reduced ties to helping institutions, and may also have disrupted the opioid use behaviors of people who use drugs. This research used Reddit to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the social networks and social processes of people who use opioids. METHODS: Data were collected from the social media forum, Reddit.com. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. (March 5, 2020, to May 13, 2020), 2,000 Reddit posts were collected from the two most popular opioid subreddits (r/OpiatesRecovery, r/Opiates). Posts were reviewed for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use resulting in a final sample of 300. Thematic analysis was guided by the Big Events framework. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was found to create changes in the social networks and daily lives among persons who use opioids. Adaptions to these changes shifted social networks leading to robust social support and mutual aid on Reddit, including sharing and seeking advice on facing withdrawal, dealing with isolation, managing cravings, and accessing recovery resources.

METHODS We retrospectively investigated cases whose cervical smears were interpreted as AGC and underwent pathological assessment at our institution between June 2009 and September 2017. AGC was subcategorized based on the Bethesda System. Not-otherwise-specified (NOS) was subcategorized into endocervical cells (NOS-EC), endometrial cells (NOS-EM), or glandular cells (NOS-G). Favor neoplastic (FN) was subcategorized into endocervical cells (FN-EC) or glandular cells (FN-G). FN-G was further subcategorized into endometrial cells (FN-EM) or unknown origin (FN-UO). Clinicopathological data were retrieved from the medical records. RESULTS Of 88 AGC cases, there were 30 NOS-EC (34.1%), 2 NOS-EM (2.3%), 25 FN-EC (28.4%), 22 FN-EM (25.0%), and 9 FN-UO (10.2%).

This dilemma might be ameliorated by a decision model that considers the prioritization of immediate needs, vulnerability of clients, and competency of service providers. Just as the medical field prioritizes immediate needs during crisis situations and defers routine appointments (e.g., physicals, check-ups, etc.), the ABA field can make similar evidence-based decisions. The purpose of the current paper is to provide a decision model for ABA practitioners who find themselves questioning the need for essential service delivery during the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Following the occurrence of thrombotic events in the affected veins, the lumen often becomes occluded with fibrin and inflammatory cells. A hyper-coagulative state is one of the underlying causes although most cases of PMD are idiopathic. Coronavirus disease-2019 infection (COVID-19) is associated with frequent thrombotic events. Inflammation and thrombosis play a central role in the course and outcome of COVID-19, which can predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism. In this report, we present a 33-year-old male patient diagnosed with PMD during the subacute phase of COVID-19 infection while on prophylactic antithrombotic treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old male patient was diagnosed as PMD which occurred during the subacute phase of COVID-19 infection, while he was on active treatment of COVID-19 by prophylactic antithrombotic Rivaroxaban 15 mg therapy and curative antiviral medication. There was no recent sexual intercourse or trauma to the genitals. His PCR test for COVID-19 had become negative, and antibody test was positive at the time of his PMDs onset. Rivaroxaban was replaced by Enoxaparin (8000 IU/0.8 ml.), a low molecular weight heparin administered subcutaneously and twice daily. On the third day of this medication, all coagulative measurements returned to normal. PMD disappeared in the second week. CONCLUSION: Low-dose Rivaroxaban 15 mg is not safe for some COVID-19-associated thromboembolism prophylaxis, and careful follow-up is critical due to the possibility of a wide range of pathologic thrombotic manifestations in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Penile Mondors in a Covid-19 patient on prophylactic anti-thrombosis with rivaroxaban: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African swine fever is a devastating disease of domestic swine and wild boar caused by a large double-stranded DNA virus that encodes for more than 150 open reading frames.

Dysregulated NF-B signalling drives inflammation in inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, re-establishing the appropriate regulation of NF-B activity seems like a promising approach to treat inflammatory diseases. Current anti-inflammatory drugs have many, often serious, side effects. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for safe and effective anti-inflammatory medicines that both decrease inflammatory mediator production and enhance endogenous anti-inflammatory and prorepair pathways. So far, traditional de novo drug discovery has fallen short of satisfying this need. Drug repurposing is a cost- and time-effective alternative to de novo drug development for the identification of novel applications and has already resulted in the identification of effective anti-inflammatories in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we critically review NF-B as a potential target for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs with an emphasis on drug repurposing as a strategy to identify new approaches to treat inflammatory diseases. ABSTRACT: NF-B is a central mediator of inflammation, response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. As a result of its central role in so many important cellular processes, NF-B dysregulation has been implicated in the pathology of important human diseases. NF-B activation causes inappropriate inflammatory responses in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, modulation of NF-B signaling is being widely investigated as an approach to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity and cancer. The emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019, the subsequent pandemic and the huge clinical burden of patients with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia led to a massive scramble to repurpose existing medicines to treat lung inflammation in a wide range of healthcare systems. These efforts continue and have proven to be controversial. Drug repurposing strategies are a promising alternative to de novo drug development, as they minimize drug development timelines and reduce the risk of failure due to unexpected side effects. Different experimental approaches have been applied to identify existing medicines which inhibit NF-B that could be repurposed as anti-inflammatory drugs.","output":"NF-B Signaling and InflammationDrug Repurposing to Treat Inflammatory Disorders?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The speech emotion recognition system determines a speaker's emotional state by analyzing his/her speech audio signal.

Unlike before, the sale of nicotine-containing e-liquids was allowed while additional national regulations included, for example, a ban for other than unflavoured and tobacco-flavoured e-liquids. This study examines the correlates of e-cigarette use before and after the comprehensive regulatory change, and characteristics and correlates of flavoured e-cigarette use after the flavour ban in the general Finnish population. METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional population-based drug surveys for 15-69-year-olds in 2014 (n = 3485; 50% response rate) and in 2018 (n = 3229; 46%). Correlates of e-cigarette use were studied with logistic regression models. RESULTS: Current e-cigarette use remained infrequent (approximately 2%) and the correlates of e-cigarette use varied only slightly between the study years. In 2018, of past-year e-cigarette users (n = 316), 43% used unflavoured e-liquids, 24% used tobacco and 43% used other flavours, fruits being the most common. In univariate models, demographic variables, smoking and e-cigarette use-related factors were associated with flavoured e-cigarette use. In multivariable models, those who used e-cigarettes to experiment used unflavoured e-cigarettes more likely than other than tobacco flavours (odds ratio 3.00, 95% confidence interval 1.15-7.82). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In Finland, the regulated entry of nicotine-containing e-liquids to retail sales has not led to increased e-cigarette use in the general population.

In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive outline of the most recent literature on the role of TCF1 in T cell development and to discuss the potential of TCF1 in sustaining CD8(+) T lymphocyte-directed anti-tumor immunity. ABSTRACT: T cell factor 1 (TCF1) is a transcription factor that has been highlighted to play a critical role in the promotion of T cell proliferation and maintenance of cell stemness in the embryonic and CD8(+) T cell populations. The regulatory nature of TCF1 in CD8(+) T cells is of great significance, especially within the context of T cell exhaustion, which is linked to the tumor and viral escape in pathological contexts. Indeed, inhibitory signals, such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), expressed on exhausted T lymphocytes (T(EX)), have become major therapeutic targets in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. The significance of TCF1 in the sustenance of CTL-mediated immunity against pathogens and tumors, as well as its recently observed necessity for an effective anti-tumor immune response in ICB therapy, presents TCF1 as a potentially significant biomarker and/or therapeutic target for overcoming CD8(+) T cell exhaustion and resistance to ICB therapy.

Methods The main outcome was the weekly averaged incidence of COVID-19 confirmed cases and hospital admissions. We performed Negative Binomial Segmented Regression (NBSR) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) analyses for the four countries (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales), and fitted Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models to compare the latter three to England, where COVID-19 certification was imposed the latest. Findings NBSR methods suggested COVID-19 certification led to a decrease in the incidence of cases in Northern Ireland, but not in hospitalizations. In Wales, they also caused a decrease in the incidence of cases but not in hospital admissions. In Scotland, we observed a decrease in both cases and admissions. ARIMA models confirmed these results. The DiD model showed that the intervention decreased the incidence of COVID compared to England in all countries except Wales, in October. Then, the incidence rate of cases already had a decreasing tendency, as well as in England, hence a particular impact of Covid Passport was less obvious. In Wales, the model coefficients were 2.2 (95% CI -6.24,10.70) for cases and -0.144 (95% CI -0.248, -0.039) for admissions in October and -7.75 (95% CI -13.1, -2.46) for cases and -0.169 (95% CI-0.308, -0.031) for admissions in November. In Northern Ireland, -10.1 (95% CI -18.4, -1.79) for cases and -0.269 (95% CI -0.385, -0.153) for admissions. In Scotland they were 7.91 (95% CI 4.46,11.4) for cases and -0.097 (95% CI -0.219,0.024) for admissions. Interpretation The introduction of mandatory certificates decreased cases in all countries except in England.

This natural course of development can have an impact on how protective the previously naturally or vaccine induced immunity is. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether and how variant specific mutations influence host immunity. To address this, we have investigated how mutations in the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern influence epitope sequence similarity, predicted binding affinity to HLA, and immunogenicity of previously reported SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell epitopes. Our data suggests that the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell recognized epitopes are not altered by variant specific mutations. Interestingly, for the CD8 T cell epitopes that are altered due to variant specific mutations, our analyses show there is a high degree of sequence similarity between mutated and reference SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell epitopes. However, mutated epitopes, primarily derived from the spike protein, in SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta, AY.4.2 and Mu display reduced predicted binding affinity to their restriction element. These findings indicate that the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern have limited ability to escape memory CD8 T cell responses raised by vaccination or prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The overall low impact of the mutations on CD8 T cell cross-recognition is in accordance with the notion that mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are primarily the result of receptor binding affinity and antibody selection pressures exerted on the spike protein, unrelated to T cell immunity.","output":"In Silico Analysis Predicts a Limited Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Variants on CD8 T Cell Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 encode spike proteins that bind human ACE2 on the cell surface to enter target cells during infection. A small fraction of humans encode variants of ACE2, thus altering the biochemical properties at the protein interaction interface. These and other ACE2 coding mutants can reveal how the spike proteins of each virus may differentially engage the ACE2 protein surface during infection. We created an engineered HEK 293T cell line for facile stable transgenic modification, and expressed the major human ACE2 allele or 28 of its missense mutants, 24 of which are possible through single nucleotide changes from the human reference sequence. Infection with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentiviruses revealed that high ACE2 cell-surface expression could mask the effects of impaired binding during infection. Drastically reducing ACE2 cell surface expression revealed a range of infection efficiencies across the panel of mutants. Our infection results revealed a non-linear relationship between soluble SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 and pseudovirus infection, supporting a major role for binding avidity during entry. While ACE2 mutants D355N, R357A, and R357T abrogated entry by both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, the Y41A mutant inhibited SARS-CoV entry much more than SARS-CoV-2, suggesting differential utilization of the ACE2 side-chains within the largely overlapping interaction surfaces utilized by the two CoV spike proteins. These effects correlated well with cytopathic effects observed during SARS-CoV-2 replication in ACE2-mutant cells. The panel of ACE2 mutants also revealed altered ACE2 surface dependencies by the N501Y spike variant, including a near-complete utilization of the K353D ACE2 variant, despite decreased infection mediated by the parental SARS-CoV-2 spike. Our results clarify the relationship between ACE2 abundance, binding, and infection, for various SARS-like coronavirus spike proteins and their mutants, and inform our understanding for how changes to ACE2 sequence may correspond with different susceptibilities to infection.","output":"Mutants of human ACE2 differentially promote SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike mediated infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel moral norms peculiar to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in tension between maintaining one's preexisting moral priorities (e.g., loyalty to one's family and human freedoms) and avoiding contraction of the COVID-19 disease and SARS COVID-2 virus. By drawing on moral foundations theory, the current study questioned how the COVID-19 pandemic (or health threat salience in general) affects moral decision making. With two consecutive pilot tests on three different samples (ns &#8776; 40), we prepared our own sets of moral foundation vignettes which were contextualized on three levels of health threats: the COVID-19 threat, the non-COVID-19 health threat, and no threat. We compared the wrongness ratings of those transgressions in the main study (N = 396, M age = 22.47). The results showed that the acceptability of violations increased as the disease threat contextually increased, and the fairness, care, and purity foundations emerged as the most relevant moral concerns in the face of the disease threat. Additionally, participants' general binding moral foundation scores consistently predicted their evaluations of binding morality vignettes independent of the degree of the health threat. However, as the disease threat increased in the scenarios, pre-existing individuating morality scores lost their predictive power for care violations but not for fairness violations. The current findings imply the importance of contextual factors in moral decision making. Accordingly, we conclude that people make implicit cost-benefit analysis in arriving at a moral decision in health threatening contexts.

The aim was to investigate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of HBO in patients with RVF in CD. METHODS: In this prospective study, consecutive CD patients between November 2018 and February 2020 presenting with RVF at the outpatient fistula clinic of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre were included and selected to receive treatment with 30 daily HBO sessions, if fistulas were actively draining and any concomitant treatment regimen was stable at least 6 weeks prior to start of HBO. Patients with a stoma were excluded. The primary endpoint was clinical closure at 3-month follow-up, defined as cessation of complaints and/or closure of the external orifice if visible at baseline. Secondary outcomes were improvement of concomitant perianal fistulas as measured by the perianal disease activity index (PDAI) and fistula drainage assessment (FDA), as well as improvement in patient-reported outcomes (visual analogue scale (VAS), inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), faecal incontinence quality of life scale (FIQL) and female sexual functioning index (FSFI)) at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Out of 14 eligible patients, nine patients (median age 50 years) were treated, all of whom had previously had one or more unsuccessful medical and/or surgical treatments for their RVF. Clinical closure occurred in none of the patients at 3-month follow-up. There was no improvement in PDAI and patient-reported outcomes (VAS, IBDQ, FIQL and FSFI). Two patients had concomitant perianal fistulas; using FDA, one patient had a clinical response and one patient was in clinical remission 3 months after HBO. There were two treatment-related adverse events during HBO concerning claustrophobia and fatigue. Furthermore, two patients had a surgical intervention due to RVF and two patients were treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection during follow-up. One patient had a dose reduction of ustekinumab because of decreased luminal complaints. CONCLUSION: Treatment with HBO was feasible, but in this therapy-refractory cohort without deviating ostomy no clinical closure of RVF or improvement in quality of life was seen 3 months after HBO. Treatment with HBO alone in this specific group of patients therefore appears to be ineffective.","output":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of rectovaginal fistulas in patients with Crohns disease: results of the HOT-REVA pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study is to explore the patient characteristics and transmission chains of COVID-19 in the population of Gansu province, and support decision-making.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2019 to December 2019, a total of 137 patients with lower urinary treatment were referred to the Pletnev City Clinical Hospital due to limited efficiency of combination therapy with -adrenergic blockers and 5-reductase inhibitors in order to undergone laser enucleation/vaporization of the prostate. After evaluation, 41 patients with absolute indications for surgical treatment or with suspected prostate cancer were excluded. After a comprehensive examination, 96 patients were prescribed tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily in combination with solifenacin 10 mg daily. All patients were followed up for 12 months. RESULTS As a result of using solifenacin, better control over storage symptoms was achieved according to the I-PSS scale (-4 points), which also led to a significant decrease in the total I-PSS score after 12 months of therapy. There was an increase in the mean voided volume (by 53%) after 6 months. Neither Qmax, nor residual urine volume did not change significantly. According to the MIEF-5 scale, an improvement in erectile function was revealed. There was a slight decrease in the average prostate volume and an increase in the PSA level from 3.1 to 4.1 ng/ml. There was no acute urinary retention. However, 6 patients discontinued taking of m-cholinoblockers due to dry mouth.

The majority (92%) were Ghana Health Service facilities, and the remaining 8% were Christian Health Association of Ghana facilities. Access to G6PD deficiency screening test was varied across the districts, and G6PD deficiency screening test was available in all eight public hospitals. This implies that the health facility-to-population ratio for G6PD deficiency testing service was approximately 1:159,210 (8/1,273,677) population. The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34  14 km, and travel time (68  27 min). The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15  11 km, and travel time (46  33 min). Conclusion: Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor. Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries. To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.","output":"Geographical Accessibility to Glucose-6-Phosphate Dioxygenase Deficiency Point-of-Care Testing for Antenatal Care in Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its emergence as a pandemic in March 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outcome has been explored via several predictive models, using specific clinical or biochemical parameters. In the current study, we developed an integrative non-linear predictive model of COVID-19 outcome, using clinical, biochemical, immunological, and radiological data of patients with different disease severities. Initially, the immunological signature of the disease was investigated through transcriptomics analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples of patients with different COVID-19 severity versus control subjects (exploratory cohort, n=61), identifying significant differential expression of several cytokines. Accordingly, 24 cytokines were validated using a multiplex assay in the serum of COVID-19 patients and control subjects (validation cohort, n=77). Predictors of severity were Interleukin (IL)-10, Programmed Death-Ligand-1 (PDL-1), Tumor necrosis factors-, absolute neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, and ferritin; with high predictive efficacy (AUC=0.93 and 0.98 using ROC analysis of the predictive capacity of cytokines and biochemical markers, respectively). Increased IL-6 and granzyme B were found to predict liver injury in COVID-19 patients, whereas interferon-gamma (IFN-), IL-1 receptor-a (IL-1Ra) and PD-L1 were predictors of remarkable radiological findings. The model revealed consistent elevation of IL-15 and IL-10 in severe cases. Combining basic biochemical and radiological investigations with a limited number of curated cytokines will likely attain accurate predictive value in COVID-19. The model-derived cytokines highlight critical pathways in the pathophysiology of the COVID-19 with insight towards potential therapeutic targets.

Methods: The consecutive records of 93 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. A series of chest CT findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The serial chest CT scans were scored on a semiquantitative basis according to the extent of pulmonary abnormalities. Chest CT scores in different periods (0 - 5 days, 6 - 10 days, 11 - 15 days, 16 - 20 days, and > 20 days) since symptom onset were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors, and the temporal trend of the radiographic-clinical features was analyzed. Results: The final cohort consisted of 93 patients: 68 survivors and 25 nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors were significantly older than survivors. For both survivors and nonsurvivors, the chest CT scores were not different in the first period (0 - 5 days) but diverged afterwards. The mortality rate of COVID-19 monotonously increased with chest CT scores, which positively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil percentage, D-dimer level, lactate dehydrogenase level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while negatively correlated with the lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count. Conclusions: Chest CT scores correlate well with risk factors for mortality over periods, thus they may be used as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19. While higher chest CT scores are associated with a higher mortality rate, CT images taken at least 6 days since symptom onset may contain more prognostic information than images taken at an earlier period.","output":"Association of clinical and radiographic findings with the outcomes of 93 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) has ravaged the world since 2019, seriously affecting human production and life.

STUDY DESIGN Case series with planned data collection. SETTING Tertiary endocrine surgery practice in an academic medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS An analysis was undertaken of 561 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroid surgery in a tertiary endocrine surgery practice from March 2004 to April 2013. There were 270 patients who had curative primary or reoperative surgery for single-gland parathyroid adenomas during this time. Clinical records, imaging studies, operative reports, and pathology findings were evaluated, and cases from a subset of patients who had an ectopic, overly descended superior parathyroid adenoma were further analyzed. The prevalence of this entity in primary and revision surgeries was calculated. RESULTS Among the 270 patients with single-gland parathyroid adenomas, there were 251 primary operations and 19 reoperative procedures referred from outside institutions. An ectopic, overly descended superior parathyroid adenoma was present in 23 (9.2%) primary cases and 4 (21.1%) reoperative cases. CONCLUSION An overly descended superior parathyroid adenoma is frequently encountered during primary parathyroid surgery. It is more than twice as common in reoperative parathyroidectomy, reflecting the propensity to be missed at the first exploration.

It can be seen that the addition of ED-24 AK, compared to the reference additive ED-20 (Epidian 5), additionally increase crosslinking density of the system, changes its mechanical and tribological properties, and exerts a positive effect on adhesion of the rubber vulcanizates to glass fiber. ED-20 and ED-24 AK resins do not enter the structure of the vulcanized rubber but act as the additives. ED-20 acts without changes in its structure, and ED-24 AK is a partially crosslinked additive. Modification, especially with ED-24 AK, makes mechanical strength of NBR increased even up to 240% in comparison to virgin rubber vulcanizate. This is responsible for lower friction of the vulcanizates. The decrease in the friction force of NBR due to the modified dian resin addition can reach up to 40%. Adhesion of the modified NBR to glass fibers increases due to its modification with the epoxy resins, however this time the ED-24 is more efficient than ED-24 AK reaching ca. 50% increase comparing to ca. 20% improvement, respectively.

We aim to characterize the ethical dilemmas trauma surgeons encounter in clinical practice and describe perceptions about the ability to manage these dilemmas and strategies they use to address them. METHODS Members of a U.S. trauma society were electronically surveyed on handling ethically challenging scenarios. The survey instrument was developed using published ethics literature and iterative cognitive interviews. Domains included perceived frequency of encountering and self-efficacy of managing ethical situations in trauma surgery. Common situations were defined as those encountered monthly or weekly. Ethical problems were categorized within 7 larger categories: general ethics, autonomy, communication, justice, end-of-life, conflict, and other. Descriptive analyses were performed; group comparisons were analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS Of 1,748 surveyed, 548 responded (30.6%) and 154 (28%) were female. Most were White, under 55 years age, had completed fellowship training, and were practicing at a level I or II trauma center. The most encountered ethical categories were generic ethics and communication (79%). Issues involving conflict were least frequent (21%). Respondents felt most uncomfortable with autonomy topics. Respondents with high self-efficacy in handling ethical situations were older, in practice 15 years, served on an ethics committee, and/or frequently experienced ethical challenges. CONCLUSION Most trauma surgeons regularly encounter ethical challenges, especially those related to communication. Trauma surgeons encounter ethical issues involving conflict least often, and lowest self-efficacy scores with issues involving autonomy. Experienced trauma surgeons reported higher self-efficacy scores in managing ethical issues.

We aimed to determine: 1) functional capacity of COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2) characteristics associated with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) performance; 3) safety and tolerability of CPET. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 discharged alive at Azienda Sanitaria Locale-3, Genoa. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic echocardiography, CPET, pulmonary function test, and dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed. RESULTS: From 225 patients discharged from March to November 2020, we excluded 12 incomplete/missing cases, 13 unable to perform CPET leading to a final population of 200. Median percent-predicted peak oxygen uptake (%pVO2) was 88% (78.3C103.1). Ninety-nine(49.5%) patients had %pVO2 below, whereas 101(50.5%) above the 85% predicted value (indicating normality). Of 61/99 patients with reduced %pVO2 but normal anaerobic threshold, 9(14.8%) had respiratory, 21(34.4%) cardiac, and 31(50.8%) non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. One-hundred sixty(80.0%) patients complain at least one symptom, without relationship with pVO2.

METHODS: Sera collected for clinical or public health testing from 2018-2020 (n=135) were used to compare all tested platforms, and inter-test agreement was assessed by Cohen's kappa coefficient. Sample category (positive/negative) was assigned based on collection date relative to the index case in Canada, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology results. 117 out of the 135 samples (31 positive, 86 negative) were assigned a category and were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity, with MSD's test results based upon manufacturer-set cut-offs. RESULTS: We observed SARS-CoV-2 target sensitivities of 100% and specificities >94% for all SARS-CoV-2 antigens (RBD, Nucleocapsid, Spike) in V-PLEX Panel 2.

Methods From March 2020 to August 2021, 91 lung recipients with C19 were included and classified as controls (BMI <30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI 30 kg/m2) at the time of LT listing. Primary outcome was death. Secondary outcome was C19-related medical morbidity. Cox proportional hazard analysis and Kaplan-Meier method were used. Results Controls (69%, n=63) and obese (31%, n=28) subjects were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics before C19 onset. Compared to controls, obese subjects tended to have more severe inflammation and a higher prevalence of hypoxemia, requirement of ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death (Table 1).

In 2017, it was reported that physical stimuli related to massage improved finger blood flow volumes, contributing to the regeneration of damaged nerves. We developed a method of hand therapy for breast cancer patients complaining of numbness related to anticancer drug administration, and examined its effects on numbness. Hand therapy was performed by a single therapist who received lectures at the Sophia Phytotherapy College, which is accredited by the Japan Handcare Association. The fingertips to wrist, ankle, metacarpal bones, palm, and elbow were massaged using the bilateral arms/fingers for 15minutes. We investigated the influences of daily living status(Support Team Assessment Sched- ule-Japan: STAS-J), age, body mass index(BMI), severity/site of numbness, type of numbness, type of drug, duration of breast cancer, duration of numbness, and presence or absence of lymph node dissection, and evaluated the severity of numbness using a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale(VAS). The study included 51 breast cancer patients complaining of numbness of the fingers, with a mean age of 59 years. In patients with relatively mild numbness(STAS-J 1), the VAS scores before and after hand therapy were 4.71.8 and 1.91.3, respectively, showing a marked decrease. In STAS-J 2 patients, the values were 4.9 1.4 and 2.11.3, respectively, also showing a marked decrease. Thus, this hand therapy reduced numbness in mild- and moderate-status patients. Statistical comparisons were performed between the STAS-J 1/2(mild/moderate numbness)and STAS-J 3/4(severe numbness)groups. Although the severity of numbness was not correlated with age, BMI, type of drug, lymph node dissection, or duration of breast cancer, the proportion of patients with a B1-year history of numbness was significantly larger in the STAS-J 1/2 group. The most frequent site of numbness was from the proximal interphalangeal joints to the fingertips. Concerning the severity of numbness, many patients complained of severe numbness, as represented by that after sitting straight.

Methods Predetermined search parameters of well-established broad categories of epilepsy aetiology were used to identify patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy attending Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. There were 3,216 patients that met the inclusion criteria for this study. We included living patients with epilepsy attending our institution. We then excluded patients with a diagnosis of pure non-epileptic attack disorder and patients found to have idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) (n = 382) from our final cohort. We excluded IGE due to the complex polygenic basis underlying this patient group. Results An aetiology was identified in 54.3% (n = 1747) of the total number of patients studied. Of the symptomatic epilepsies, 41.08% (n = 1321) were acquired and 13.3% (n = 426) were predominantly of genetic or developmental aetiology. The most common causes of the acquired epilepsies were hippocampal sclerosis (n = 380; 28.75%), cerebral tumor (n = 279; 21.06%), traumatic brain injury (n = 248; 18.77%), stroke and cerebrovascular disease (n = 151; 11.43%) and perinatal causes (n = 138; 10.45%). The leading causes in the genetic / developmental category included cavernous haemangiomas (n = 62, 22.22%), arteriovenous malformations (n = 59; 21.15%) and cortical dysplasia (n = 55; 19.71%).

We hypothesized that colchicine, by counteracting proinflammatory pathways implicated in the uncontrolled inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients, reduces pulmonary complications, and improves survival. METHODS: This retrospective study included 71 consecutive COVID-19 patients (hospitalized with pneumonia on CT scan or outpatients) who received colchicine and compared with 70 control patients who did not receive colchicine in two serial time periods at the same institution. We used inverse probability of treatment propensity-score weighting to examine differences in mortality, clinical improvement (using a 7-point ordinary scale), and inflammatory markers between the two groups. RESULTS: Amongst the 141 COVID-19 patients (118 [83.7%] hospitalized), 70 (50%) received colchicine. The 21-day crude cumulative mortality was 7.5% in the colchicine group and 28.5% in the control group (P = 0.006; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.24 [95%CI: 0.09 to 0.67]); 21-day clinical improvement occurred in 40.0% of the patients on colchicine and in 26.6% of control patients (adjusted relative improvement rate: 1.80 [95%CI: 1.00 to 3.22]). The strong association between the use of colchicine and reduced mortality was further supported by the diverging linear trends of percent daily change in lymphocyte count (P = 0.018), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.003), and in C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.009). Colchicine was stopped because of transient side effects (diarrhea or skin rashes) in 7% of patients. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort study colchicine was associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery in COVID-19 patients.

Optimised medical therapy (OMT), the first-line treatment modality in CS, may reduce or delay - but it does not abolish - CS-related strokes. As per current AHA/ASA and ESC/ESVS/ESO guidelines, carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a less-invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for CS revascularisation in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Ten-year follow-up from the CREST trial in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic CS confirmed equipoise of CAS and CEA in the primary endpoint. Nevertheless CAS - using a widely open-cell, first-generation stent and first-generation (distal/filter) neuroprotection - has been criticised for its relative excess of (mostly minor) strokes by 30 days, a significant proportion of which were post-procedural. Atherosclerotic plaque protrusion through conventional carotid stent struts, confirmed on intravascular imaging, has been implicated as a leading mechanism of the relative excess of strokes with CAS vs. CEA, including delayed strokes with CAS. Different designs of mesh-covered carotid stents have been developed to prevent plaque prolapse. Several multi-centre/multi-specialty clinical studies with CGurad MicroNet-Covered Embolic Prevention Stent System (EPS) and RoadSaver/Casper were recently published and included routine DW-MRI cerebral imaging peri-procedurally and at 30 days (CGuard EPS). Data from more than 550 patients in mesh-covered carotid stent clinical studies to-date show an overall 30-day complication rate of ~1% with near-elimination of post-procedural events. While more (and long-term) evidence is still anticipated, these results - taken together with optimised intra-procedural neuroprotection in CAS (increased use of proximal systems including trans-carotid dynamic flow reversal) and the positive 12-month mesh-covered stent data reports in 2017 - are transforming the carotid revascularisation field today. Establishing effective algorithms to identify the asymptomatic subjects at stroke risk despite OMT, and large-scale studies with mesh-covered stents including long-term clinical and duplex ultrasound outcomes, are the next major goals.","output":"One swallow does not a summer make but many swallows do: accumulating clinical evidence for nearly-eliminated peri-procedural and 30-day complications with mesh-covered stents transforms the carotid revascularisation field."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The milder form of infection and higher rates of recovery witnessed among COVID-19 patients in India is indicative of the potential intervention of other unconventional biological mechanisms.

The aim of this study was to characterize the U.S. post-marketing safety (PMS) profiles of these vaccines with an in-depth analysis of mortality data. METHODS: This was a retrospective database analysis study. Details of the U.S. PMS reports (15 December 2020 to 19 March 2021) of the three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S) were retrieved from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). A descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the reported adverse events (AEs). A comparative (Pfizer-BioNTech vs. Moderna) analysis of mortality was conducted. The mean count ratio of death between the two vaccines was estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusting for the measured confounders. RESULTS: A total of 44,451 AE reports were retrieved (corresponding to 0.05% of the U.S. population who received at least one dose). The most commonly reported AEs were injection site reactions (30.4% of the reports), pain (reported in 26.7% of the reports), and headache (18.6% of the reports). Serious AEs were reported in only 14.6% of the reports with 4,108 hospitalizations. The total number of deaths was 1,919 with a mean count ratio of Moderna (n = 997) vs. Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 899) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.33).

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expansion of MMC9s remain unknown. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that IL-4 regulates MMC9 development and MMC9-dependent experimental IgE-mediated food allergy. METHODS We utilized an epicutaneous sensitization-model and performed bone marrow (BM) reconstitution experiments, to test the requirement of IL-4R signaling on MMC9's in experimental IgE-mediated food allergy. Flow cytometric, bulk and single cell RNA-seq analysis on small intestine (SI)-MMC9s was performed to illuminate MMC9 transcriptional signature and the effect of IL-4R signaling on MMC9 function. BM-derived MMC9 culture system was used to define IL-4-BATF signaling in MMC9 development. RESULTS Epicutaneous sensitization and BM reconstitution based models of IgE-mediated food allergy revealed an IL-4 signaling-dependent cell-intrinsic effect on SI- MMC9 cell accumulation and food allergy severity. RNA-seq analysis of SI-MMC9 cells identified 410 gene transcripts reciprocally regulated by IL-4 signaling, including Il9 and Basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (Batf). In silico analyses identified a 3491-gene MMC9 transcriptional signature and identified two transcriptionally distinct SI-MMC9 populations enriched for metabolic or inflammatory programs. Employing an in vitro MMC9-culture model system we show that generation of MMC9-like cells was induced by IL-4 and this was in part dependent on BATF. CONCLUSION IL-4R signaling directly modulates MMC9 function and exacerbation of experimental IgE-mediated food allergic reactions.

Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample = 3,540). RESULTS: About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratio's [aOR] &#8804; .070). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.45-0.67).

Progressive hypercapnic respiratory failure and ineffective airway clearance are key issues in this patient population. Often at the time of hospital presentation, patients are already supported by home mechanical ventilatory support with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and an airway clearance regimen. Prognosis is poor once a patient develops acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and invasive mechanical ventilatory support, commonly leading to tracheostomy or palliative-focused care. We focus on this understudied group of patients with ALS without tracheostomy and incorporate existing data to propose a technical approach to the triage and management of acute respiratory failure, primarily for those who require intubation and mechanical ventilatory support for reversible causes, and also for progression of end-stage disease. Optimizing management in this setting improves both quality and quantity of life. Neuromuscular patients with acute respiratory failure require protocolized and personalized triage and treatment.

The triage phase incorporates comprehensive evaluation for new etiologies of hypoxia and hypercapnia, which are not initially presumed to be secondary to progression or end-stage neuromuscular respiratory failure. In select patients, this may involve intubation or advanced adjustments of NIV machines. Next, once the acute etiology(s) is identified and treated, the focus shifts: training and use of mechanical airway clearance to optimize pulmonary function, facilitation of NIV wean or successful extubation to NIV, and transition to a stable regimen for home ventilation.

Using interrupted time series regression models, we evaluated the policy impact on user endorsements (i.e., likes) of anti- and pro-vaccine posts on Facebook. RESULTS: The number of likes for posts on anti-vaccine Pages had decreased after the policy implementation (policy = 153.2, p < 0.05; policy*day = -0.838, p < 0.05; marginal effect at the mean = -22.74, p < 0.01; marginal effect at the median = -24.56, p < 0.01). When the number of subscribers was considered, the policy effect on the number of likes for anti-vaccine posts was much smaller, but still statistically significant (policy = 4.849, p < 0.05; policy*day = -0.027, p < 0.05; marginal effect at the mean = -0.742, p < 0.01; marginal effect at the median = -0.800, p < 0.01). There was no policy effect observed for posts on pro-vaccine Pages. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested that Facebook's March 2019 vaccine misinformation policy moderately impacted the number of endorsements of anti-vaccine content on its platform. Social media companies can take measures to limit the popularity of anti-vaccine content by reducing their reach and visibility. Future research efforts should focus on evaluating additional policies and examining policies across platforms.","output":"The impact of Facebook's vaccine misinformation policy on user endorsements of vaccine content: An interrupted time series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Listeria monitoring program for Austrian dairies and cheese factories was established in 1988.

Furthermore, conventional meta-analyses are unable to test possible effects of moderators affecting this relationship. This protocol outlines the building of a comprehensive database of the literature in this research field. In addition, we will conduct an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) to establish the effectiveness of psychotherapy in reducing suicidality, and to examine which factors moderate the efficacy of these interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS To build a comprehensive database, randomised controlled trials examining the effect of any psychotherapy targeting any psychiatric disorder on suicidal thoughts or behaviour will be identified by running a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from data inception to 12 August 2019. For the IPD-MA, we will focus on adult outpatients with suicidal ideation or behaviour. In addition, as a comparison group we will focus on a control group (waiting-list, care as usual or placebo). A 1-stage IPD-MA will be used to determine the effectiveness of psychotherapy on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and/or suicide deaths, and to investigate potential patient-related and intervention-related moderators. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test the robustness of the findings. Additionally, a conventional MA will be conducted to determine the differences between studies that provided IPD and those that did not. IPD-MA may determine the effectiveness of psychotherapy in reducing suicidality and provide insights into the moderating factors influencing the efficacy of psychotherapy. Answering these questions will inform mental healthcare practitioners about optimal treatments for different groups of individuals with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour and consequently help to reduce suicide risk. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION An ethical approval is not required for this study. The results will be published in a peer-review journal.

AIM To study psychosocial responses to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of intervention among nurses. MATERIALS AND METHODS A mixed-method study was conducted, including 278 nurses from two COVID-19 hospitals of the province by purposive sampling. Depression, anxiety and stress and a composite measure of personal financial burden scales for quantitative; and interview guide for qualitative data were used. A psychosocial strengthening session was introduced and the effectiveness of the program was assessed after 4-5 weeks of intervention. RESULTS Mild, moderate and severe depression was found among 13.7%, 9.4% and 1.1% of the participants correspondingly. Mild, moderate, severe and extremely severe anxiety was found among 21.2%, 8.6%, 3.2% and 2.2% of the participants respectively. Stress was mild among 9% and moderate in 1.4% of the participants. Lack of PPE and fear of transmitting infection were found as frequent causes of problems. Mean scores of depression, anxiety and stress were significantly decreased after the psychosocial strengthening program. CONCLUSION Depression, anxiety and stress are common issues of nurses. Common causes of problems were lack of resources, fear of being infected and fear of transmitting to family members.

However, a comparison based on scientific assumptions is necessary to deeply understand the mechanisms activated by stereotypes in conditions of stress. The global health emergency from COVID-19 offers the opportunity to compare countries with different socio-cultural conditions, whose population has been subjected to the same stressful event during the lockdown phase. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The same questionnaire was disseminated in both Italy and Turkey during their respective lockdown phases. 140,000 interviews were collected in Italy and 10,000 in Turkey, a number big enough to obtain useful information for a comparative analysis in relation to behaviours, attitudes and well-being, also using the recursive regression models. RESULTS The results, based on scientific data, show that gender stereotypes are much more rooted in Turkey than in Italy, where the emancipation process of the population is more advanced, producing profound social changes and decreasing differences between men and women in terms of behaviour and reactions to difficult situations, such as the present one. CONCLUSIONS Stereotypes, which are hostile to any opposite evidence, affect individual behaviours and attitudes to the point that, within a specific context, they play a protective role against the uncertainty during a period of health emergency, inducing people to seek shelter in pre-established and widespread behavioural models. According to the data analysis, this has happened in Turkey more than in Italy. The results show that within a culture still strongly pervaded by these social conditioning, especially at the presence of low levels of education, the adherence to gender roles constitutes a \\"protective factor\\" of the individual well-being against external stress factors.","output":"Comparing the influence of gender stereotypes on well-being in Italy and Turkey during the COVID-19 lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeskripsikan bentuk tantangan serta dampak digitalisasi pendidikan di tengah pandemi COVID-19 di Desa Bendanpete.

The goal of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant \\"epitope hotspot\\" regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3,400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA haplotypes of approximately 22,000 individuals to develop a \\"digital twin\\" type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population; the approach identified an optimal constellation of epitope hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.","output":"Artificial intelligence predicts the immunogenic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 leading to universal blueprints for vaccine designs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores member state constellations regarding the prospects for the future of Europe debate.

Because interferon-gamma (IFN-) plays an important role in inflammation, this work assessed IFN- single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that may be associated with sepsis. METHODS: A total of 196 patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and 213 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers participated in our study from July 2012 to July 2013 in Guangzhou, China. Patient clinical information was collected. Clinical pathology was assessed in subgroups defined based on clinical criteria, APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) and SOFA (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) scores and discharge rate. Four functional SNPs, ?1616T/C (rs2069705), ?764G/C (rs2069707), +874A/T (rs2430561) and +3234C/T (rs2069718), were genotyped by Snapshot in both sepsis patients and healthy controls. Pearsons chi-square test or Fishers exact test were used to analyze the distribution of the SNPs, and the probability values (P values), odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: No mutations in the IFN- ?764G/C SNP were detected among the participants in our study. The +874A/T and +3234C/T SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2) = 0.894). The ?1616 TC+TT, +874 AT+AA genotype and the TAC haplotype were significantly associated with sepsis susceptibility, while the CTT haplotype was associated with protection against sepsis incidence. Genotype of ?1616 TT wasnt only protective against severity of sepsis, but also against higher APACHE II and SOFA scores as +874 AA and +3234 CC. The TAC haplotype was was protective against progression to severe sepsis either.

However, even the latest perimetric methods have shortcomingsa high cognitive demand and requiring prolonged stable fixation and feedback through a button response. Consequently, an approach using eye movements (EM)as a natural responsehas been proposed as an alternate way to evaluate the presence of VFD. This approach has given good results for computer-simulated VFD. However, its use in patients is not well documented yet. Here we use this new approach to quantify the spatiotemporal properties (STP) of EM of various patients suffering from glaucoma and neuro-ophthalmological VFD and controls. METHODS: In total, 15 glaucoma patients, 37 patients with a neuro-ophthalmological disorder, and 21 controls performed a visual tracking task while their EM were being recorded. Subsequently, the STP of EM were quantified using a cross-correlogram analysis. Decision trees were used to identify the relevant STP and classify the populations. RESULTS: We achieved a classification accuracy of 94.5% (TPR/sensitivity = 96%, TNR/specificity = 90%) between patients and controls. Individually, the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 86.3% (TPR for neuro-ophthalmology [97%], glaucoma [60%], and controls [86%]). The STP of EM were highly similar across two different control cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: In an ocular tracking task, patients with VFD due to different underlying pathology make EM with distinctive STP. These properties are interpretable based on different clinical characteristics of patients and can be used for patient classification.

Edema and raised intracranial pressure contribute to poor outcome after ICH. Glibenclamide blocks the sulfonylurea 1 transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (Sur1-Trpm4) channel implicated in edema formation. While glibenclamide has been found to improve outcome and reduce mortality in animal models of severe ischemic stroke, in ICH the effects are less clear. In our previous study, we found no benefit after a moderate-sized bleed, while others have reported benefit. Here we tested the hypothesis that glibenclamide may only be effective in severe ICH, where edema is an important contributor to outcome. Glibenclamide (10 g/kg loading dose, 200 ng/h continuous infusion) was administered 2 hours post-ICH induced by collagenase injection into the striatum of adult rats. A survival period of 24 hours was maintained for experiments 1-3, and 72 hours for experiment 4. Glibenclamide did not affect hematoma volume (~81 L) or other safety endpoints (e.g., glucose levels), suggesting the drug is safe. However, glibenclamide did not lessen striatal edema (~83% brain water content), ionic dyshomeostasis (Na+, K+), or functional impairment (e.g., neurological deficits (median = 10 out of 14), etc.) at 24 hours. It also did not affect edema at 72 h (~86% brain water content), or overall mortality rates (25% and 29.4% overall in vehicle vs. glibenclamide-treated severe strokes). Furthermore, glibenclamide appears to worsen cytotoxic edema in the peri-hematoma region (cell bodies were 46% larger at 24 h, p = 0.0017), but no effect on cell volume or density was noted elsewhere.

Particularly high-risk groups show considerable mortality rates after infection. In 2020, an inexorable number of case reports, case series and ultimately various systematic reviews have been published reporting on morbidity and mortality risk of SARS-CoV-2 in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. However, this vast array of publications resulted in an increasing complexity of the field, overwhelming even the expert reader. METHODS: : We performed a structured literature review comprising electronic databases, transplant journals and included literature from previous systematic reviews covering the entire year 2020. From 164 included articles we identified 3451 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected SOT recipients. RESULTS: : Infections resulted in a hospitalization rate of 84% and 24% intensive care unit admissions (ICU) in the included patients. Whereas 53.6% of patients were reported to have recovered, cross-sectional overall mortality reported after COVID-19 was at 21.1%. Synoptic data concerning immunosuppressive medication attested to the reduction or withdrawal of antimetabolites (81.9%) and calcineurin inhibitors (48.9%) as a frequent adjustment. In contrast, steroids were reported to be increased in 46.8% of SOT patients. CONCLUSIONS: : COVID-19 in SOT recipients is associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Conforming with current guidelines, modifications of immunosuppressive therapies mostly comprised a reduction or withdrawal of antimetabolites and calcineurin inhibitors, while frequently maintaining or even increasing steroids. Here, we provide an accessible overview to the topic and synoptic estimates of expectable outcomes regarding in-hospital mortality of SOT patients diseased with COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in solid organ transplant recipients - a structured review of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To say that coronavirus is highly visible is a massive understatement in terms of its omnipresence in our lives and media coverage concerning it, yet also clearly untrue in terms of the virus itself. COVID-19 is our invisible enemy, changing our lives radically without ever revealing itself directly. In this paper I explore its invisibility and how it relates to and exposes other invisible enemies we are and have been fighting, in many cases without even realizing. First, I analyse the virus itself and how its stealthy nature has transformed our lives. Second, I describe how the invisible epidemic of social media sharing of fake news about the virus worsens the situation further. Third, I explore how the virus has revealed to us what really matters in our lives and has forced us to re-evaluate our priorities. Fourth, I go on to explore the underlying structural weaknesses and disparities in society that have been exposed by the virus but previously remained unconsidered for so long that they too have become camouflaged, even if their effects are all too apparent; like the virus, neoliberal capitalism is an invisible enemy that has made prisoners of us all. I conclude by suggesting that the coronavirus pandemic represents a hidden opportunity to overcome perhaps the biggest invisible enemy of all: the moral distance that separates us from others. Only by rendering the rest of humanity morally visible to ourselves can we overcome capitalism and stop treating other people as invisible enemies.","output":"Invisible Enemies: Coronavirus and Other Hidden Threats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) have been widely implemented in medical practice to improve antimicrobial prescribing and reduce selection for multidrug-resistant pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To implement different antimicrobial stewardship intervention packages in 135 veterinary practices and assess their impact on antimicrobial prescribing. METHODS: In October 2018, general veterinary clinics were assigned to one of three levels of ASP, education only (CON), intermediate (AMS1) or intensive (AMS2). De-identified prescribing data (1 October 2016 to 31 October 2020), sourced from VetCompass Australia, were analysed and a Poisson regression model fitted to identify the effect of the interventions on the incidence rates of antimicrobial prescribing. RESULTS: The overall incidence rate (IR) of antimicrobial prescribing for dogs and cats prior to the intervention was 3.7/100 consultations, which declined by 36% (2.4/100) in the implementation period, and by 50% (1.9/100) during the post-implementation period. Compared with CON, in AMS2 there was a 4% and 6% reduction in the overall IR of antimicrobial prescribing, and a 24% and 24% reduction in IR of high importance antimicrobial prescribing, attributable to the intervention in the implementation and post-implementation periods, respectively. A greater mean difference in the IR of antimicrobial prescribing was seen in high-prescribing clinics. CONCLUSIONS: These AMS interventions had a positive impact in a large group of general veterinary practices, resulting in a decline in overall antimicrobial use and a shift towards use of antimicrobials rated as low importance, with the greatest impact in high-prescribing clinics.","output":"Antimicrobial stewardship in companion animal practice: an implementation trial in 135 general practice veterinary clinics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the perception and awareness of risk among adult participants in Bangladesh about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Little is known about the effects of a pandemic on the presentation and admission to an outpatient clinic. Our aim was to gain a better understanding of the effects of reduced neurosurgical care access from the patient perspective, especially in terms of anxiety and urgency of treatment, and to improve outpatient management in case of a potential second wave and potential restrictions on health care. Methods: A questionnaire study over a period of four weeks following the COVID-19 lock down at our academical neurosurgical department was performed. A 15-items questionnaire was distributed to the patients with 3 additional questions to be answered by the treating neurosurgeon. Results: A total of 437 questionnaires was analyzed. Overall anxiety to visit a general practitioner or the outpatient facility within the hospital was very low among patients. A quarter of all appointments had to be postponed due to COVID-19, in 0.6 % of which postponement was perceived as incorrect by the treating neurosurgeon. 43% did not get an appointment due to the restrictions, 20 % did not want to bother the medical system and only 4 % were afraid to get infected in the hospital. Conclusion: Despite COVID-19, patients in need of neurosurgical service were hardly afraid to visit doctors and/or hospitals.

METHODS: An anonymous online REDCap survey was developed and emailed to 436 dental and dental hygiene students at a US dental school. The survey consisted of 81 questions that covered demographics, career plans postgraduation, and readiness and wellness measures. An open-ended question assessing how students' career plans have changed during the pandemic was also included. RESULTS: A total of 252 students completed the survey, of whom 11.5% reported that their plans for future dental practice have changed since the COVID-19 outbreak. Students who reported a change to their career plans had significantly higher mean perceived stress (20.1 vs. 16.3; P = 0.003) and anxiety (9.2 vs. 6.2; P = 0.004) scores and lower mean resilience (18.9 vs. 20.9; P = 0.01) scores than those who reported no change to their career plans. Concerns were raised regarding the limited employment opportunities, long-term stability of the dental profession, and the interruptions to clinical education and licensure examinations consequent to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive effort inclusive of adeptly designed clinical and curriculum experiences paired with wellness interventions and support tailored to students is needed. These measures need to support trainees across varying years in training and resilience levels to be effective for dental and dental hygiene students as they approach their future career intentions in the dental profession. Additional longitudinal research is needed to assess if change in career intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic corresponds with actual change postpandemic and affects the dental profession.

In the phase III MAGELLAN (Multicenter, rAndomized, parallel Group Efficacy and safety study for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medically iLL patients comparing rivaroxabAN with enoxaparin) trial, extended-duration rivaroxaban was compared with standard-duration enoxaparin followed by placebo for VTE prevention in 8101 hospitalized acutely ill patients with or without HF. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the relationship between HF severity and the risk of VTE in MAGELLAN patients. METHODS AND RESULTS Hospitalized patients diagnosed with HF were included according to New York Heart Association class III or IV at admission (n=2593). HF severity was determined by N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plasma concentrations (median 1904 pg/mL). Baseline plasma D-dimer concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 1.7 g/L for the less and more severe HF subgroups. Patients with more severe HF had a greater incidence of VTE versus patients with less severe HF, with a significant trend up to Day 10 (4.3% versus 2.2%; P=0.0108) and Day 35 (7.2% versus 4.1%; P=0.0150). Multivariable analysis confirmed that NT-proBNP concentration was associated with VTE risk up to Day 10 (P=0.017) and D-dimer concentration with VTE risk up to Day 35 (P=0.005). The association between VTE risk and HF severity that was observed in the enoxaparin/placebo group was not seen in the extended-duration rivaroxaban group. CONCLUSIONS Patients with more severe HF, as defined by high NT-proBNP plasma concentration, were at increased risk of VTE. NT-proBNP may be useful to identify high short-term risk, whereas elevated D-dimer may be suggestive of high midterm risk. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Increased parasite virulence selects for higher immune sensitivity under immunopathological costs but low sensitivity when the costs are autoimmune, contradicting previous theoretical results. Longer lifespan of the host selects for low sensitivity under immunopathology to avoid accumulated tissue damage. Under autoimmune costs, hosts with a shorter lifespan cannot afford to shorten it further due to autoimmunity and evolve lower immune sensitivity.

Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners should consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available).

It is therefore important to systematically summarize published literature in order to find out which mental health interventions generate effective support for informal caregivers of persons living with dementia. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of intervention content, effectiveness and subgroup differentiation of mental health interventions for informal caregivers of persons with dementia living at home. METHOD: We searched four electronic databases (PubMed, PsychINFO, Scopus and CINAHL) and included only methodically high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English or German language between 2009 and 2018. The intervention programmes focused on mental health of family caregivers. A narrative synthesis of the included studies is given. RESULTS: Forty-eight publications relating to 46 intervention programmes met the inclusion criteria. Burden, depression and quality of life (QoL) are the predominant parameters that were investigated. Twenty-five of forty-six interventions (54.3%) show positive effects on at least one of the outcomes examined. Most often, positive effects are reported for the outcome subjective burden (46.2%). Only six studies explicitly target on a certain subgroup of informal dementia caregivers (13%), whereas all other interventions (87%) target the group as a whole without differentiation. CONCLUSION: The most beneficial results were found for cognitive behavioural approaches, especially concerning the reduction of depressive symptoms.

As the Lockdown was implemented and the daily workforce reduced, an alternate method was employed to provide uninterrupted learning. Blended learning that includes virtual learning with face-to-face learning/teaching was utilized for the surgical trainees. MOODLE (Modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment), an open-source learning management system, was integrated as an Online Component of our Blended Learning Program. We aimed to evaluate the perception of postgraduate trainees of General Surgery regarding the benefits and limitations of Blended Learning, particularly its online component, i.e., Moodle LMS, for the betterment of surgical -education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods Thirty-three postgraduate general surgery trainees were enrolled in a blended learning program, in which its online component, Moodle LMS, comprised four major topics on General Surgery. A questionnaire was provided to the trainees to obtain feedback on blended learning in general, and Moodle LMS was mainly themed on the Likert scale. Results The approach of blended learning was positively received by the participants, the majority of whom were females (75%) and comprising of Year 1 residents (33.3%). Nearly half of the participants found Moodle LMS user-friendly, practical and a good platform for learning. However, nearly two thirds (60.6%) were uncertain if it ever helped in applying knowledge to interpret laboratory and radiological results for patient management. Even then, most of them found that the face-to-face component of blended learning helped them develop specific clinical and surgical skills (42.4%). Emphatically, 78.7% would recommend it for surgical training. Conclusion Blended learning was found to be beneficial in the training process of surgical postgraduates in the current COVID-19 pandemic situation.

Many countries have enforced strict controls on movement and socializing in an effort to manage the pandemic. Both, in-patient and out-patient care has been affected. There is big gap between health care service providers and patients and because of that many people are suffering. But telemedicine appears to be only bridge between them so that patients can get maximum benefit from the experts. This study is being conducted to know the worth of telemedicine in urology during ongoing COVID pandemic and for future prospect. Materials & Methods: All the patients who made a call on telemedicine contact number of department of urology of our tertiary care hospital and took advice for their treatment or follow up from April 2020 to December 2020, were included in this prospective observational study. Patients contacted us through various modalities like Voice/video call, WhatsApp chat, messages. Patients who contacted us for non-urological problem were excluded. All calls were answered by Professional Urologist and advice was given verbally as well as sent them in written on a prescription slip through WhatsApp. Data collection included age, sex, place, symptoms and advice given. Results: During the study period, we received 1102 calls from the patients of North India, 124 patients were excluded for being non-urological and 978 patients were included. 94% patients contacted us through voice call, 4% through video call and 2% through chat only. Average duration of call was 16 minutes and 25 seconds. 68% patients were males, while 32% females. 54% patients were younger than 40 years and only 15% were elder than 60 years. Common reasons for calling us were- urinary tract infection (23%), lower urinary tracts symptoms (21%), renal stone disease (17%), haematuria (11%), post-operated cases (11%) and sexual problems (7%). Approximately 16% patients had some urological malignancy. Only 18% patients contacted us for acute illness of duration <1 week, while 47% patients were sick for >4 weeks. 18% patients needed only counselling for their disease, 65% required prescription and conservative management. 17% patients were requiring in-hospital management so referred to nearby urological center for urgent intervention or care. None of the patients had any problem in getting medications from pharmacy. Conclusions: Telemedicine provides specialized clinical support for urologists and patients just by using mobile phones, as a logistically feasible alternative to face-to-face consultation. 83% of cases were successfully managed just by telemedicine and very useful for reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 126 crowns with four identical buccal surfaces were fabricated using seven different CAD/CAM materials: CEREC Blocs unglazed (CBU), CEREC Blocs glazed (CBG), IPS Empress CAD (EMP), IPS e.max CAD (EMA), VITA SUPRINITY PC (SUP), inCoris TZI (TZI) and VITA ENAMIC (ENA). A total of 504 APC Flash-Free (APC FF)-precoated brackets were bonded applying three surface treatments: (1) MI; (2) MEP and (3) 9.6% HF. SBS was performed after 24 h and TC. Results were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS MEP conditioning yielded lower SBS results compared with MI and 9.6% HF for CBG (24 h and TC) and EMA (TC) materials. EMP conditioning with MEP after 24 h obtained lower SBS values compared with MI; however, after TC, SBS was similar to MI group and higher than with 9.6% HF. After TC for TZI ceramic, MI protocol (sandblasting) obtained higher SBS scores than MEP, but similar than 9.6% HF. Treatment of ENA with MI and MEP produced higher results than 9.6% HF after TC. SBS results were similar for CBU and SUP, regardless of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS Although each CAD/CAM material requires specific surface treatment to obtain the highest SBS of APC FF brackets, the treatment with MEP is a valid orthodontic alternative for most of the materials tested. TC significantly decreased SBS for most of the materials. CLINICAL RELEVANCE MEP can be considered a valid and promising product to condition most of the CAD/CAM ceramics evaluated for APC FF bracket bonding purposes, allowing a faster and safer procedure.","output":"Effect of a single-component ceramic conditioner on shear bond strength of precoated brackets to different CAD/CAM materials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has the potential to transform the discovery of viruses causing unexplained acute febrile illness (UAFI) because it does not depend on culturing the pathogen or a priori knowledge of the pathogens nucleic acid sequence.

We have used NGS to identify RNA viruses in the blood of 195 patients with UAFI and compared them with those found in 328 apparently healthy (i.e., no overt signs of illness) control individuals, all from communities in southeastern Nigeria. Among UAFI patients, we identified the presence of nucleic acids from several well-characterized pathogenic viruses, such as HIV-1, hepatitis, and Lassa virus.

These viruses, which we call Ekpoma virus-1 (EKV-1) and Ekpoma virus-2 (EKV-2), are highly divergent, with little identity to each other or other known viruses. The most closely related rhabdoviruses are members of the genus Tibrovirus and Bas-Congo virus (BASV), which was recently identified in an individual with symptoms resembling hemorrhagic fever. Furthermore, by conducting a serosurvey of our study cohort, we find evidence for remarkably high exposure rates to the identified rhabdoviruses. The recent discoveries of novel rhabdoviruses by multiple research groups suggest that human infection with rhabdoviruses might be common. While the prevalence and clinical significance of these viruses are currently unknown, these viruses could have previously unrecognized impacts on human health; further research to understand the immunological and developmental impact of these viruses should be explored.

Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case-study diseases with diverse natural histories, including Ebola, influenza A, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks.

In this topical review, we propose a conceptual model of multidomain pain resilience (MDPR) in late AYAs with chronic pain that extends existing pain resilience literature, including the Ecological Resilience-Risk Model for Pediatric Chronic Pain. METHOD A conceptual framework for MDPR in late AYAs was developed from the existing literature on resilience in young people with chronic pain. Gaps in knowledge specific to late AYAs are identified, and relevant research examining MDPR in adults with pain are summarized to inform applications of this concept to youth as they transition to adulthood. RESULTS Few studies have explored resilience factors in pediatric pain. Of note, these endeavors have largely neglected late adolescence and young adulthood, despite unique considerations germane to this crucial developmental period. Existing research has also focused exclusively on assessing resilience as a unitary, rather than a multidimensional construct.

The data were collected at a time when universities in Poland were under lockdowns. Participants represented students of many different fields of study. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used. Student's subjective evaluation of online learning and their adaptation to academic life shifts were reviewed. A total of 1123 participants took part in this study. Relationship analysis included tests, such as U Mann-Whitney, appropriate for specific variables. The impact of variables connected with the pandemic on the GHQ scores was tested using multivariate regression analysis. The results were considered significant at a p-value set at 0.05. Overall, 76.96% of the participants manifested psychopathological symptoms measured by the GHQ. Four demographical variables were possibly associated with the GHQ scores: female sex, living in a big city, necessity to move back home, and being in a relationship. Negative correlations between subjective evaluation of variables concerning e-learning, such as its efficiency or quality, and the GHQ scores were found. Some variables were found to be potential protective factors, whereas others could have contributed to worsened mental health.

Currently, there is no effective way to prevent PRRSV infection. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of dipotassium glycyrrhetate (DG), a derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid, on PRRSV infection ability. METHODS The cytotoxicity of DG was measured by MTT assay, and the effects of DG on PRRSV N gene/protein were investigated using real-time PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assay. In addition, the effect of DG on cell apoptosis was analysed by fluorescence staining. RESULTS Our results indicated that DG could effectively inhibit virus replication and N gene expression in MARC-145 cells infected with PRRSV. When the infected cells received DG, the numbers of apoptotic cells were decreased, and the cleaved caspase-3 contents were decreased dramatically. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that DG could effectively inhibit the PRRS virus via multiple pathways including inhibition of virus replication and N gene expression and reduction of apoptotic cells. DG can serve as a potential chemical for PRRSV prevention and control.","output":"In vitro antiviral activity and underlying molecular mechanisms of dipotassium glycyrrhetate against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, induces severe pneumonia mainly in elderly males.

We conduct a mathematical analysis using a simple epidemiological model and perform simulations which show how this conclusion changes if we relax the assumption of unlimited capacity in containment efforts such as contact tracing.

We found that SARS-CoV-2 replication was impaired by primary, but not secondary, rhino- and influenza virus infection. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 had no effect on the replication of these seasonal respiratory viruses.

This could be explained by age-related impairment of immunity. Social factors such as congregate housing could also play a role[1]. Similarly, cancer patients have been identified as being high-risk for mortality. Thromboembolic events arising as a result of a cytokine storm has been theorised as a potential cause of death as illustrated in figure 1[2]. Previous studies have highlighted male sex as being another high-risk group for morbidity and mortality[2] . We aim to investigate the effects of age, gender and active cancer on the mortality rate and the length of in-patient stay in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective study of all in-patients aged  18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi squared and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: 445 COVID-19 positive patients were included in the study, of which 69 had active cancer, 329 were aged &lt;65 years and 116 were aged &gt; 65 years. The study contained 261 males and 263 females. Mortality in patients with active cancer was higher (70%) compared to those without active cancer (48%) (P=0.001). There was no significant difference in the number of patients who had an inpatient stay of &gt;7 days between both groups. We also found that there was a higher mortality rate in patients aged &gt; 65 years (61%) compared to those aged &lt; 65 years (25%) (P&lt;0.05), with a greater number of patients aged &gt; 65 years staying &gt;7 days in-hospital (63%) compared to those aged &lt; 65 years (49%) (P=0.03). There were no significant differences in the mortality rates and the length of in-patient stays of &gt;7 days between male and female patients. However, interestingly males had a greater intubation rate (14%) compared to females (6%) (P=0.025). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated increasing age and active cancer status to be linked to greater risk of mortality. Furthermore, males showed a more severe disease course as compared to females.

Extracellular traps (ETs) are an important natural mechanism of immunity involving resistance to pathogens. When immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages are stimulated by external pathogens, they release a fibrous network structure, consisting mainly of DNA and protein, that can capture and kill a variety of extracellular pathogenic microorganisms.

Having a vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) can be a safe and empowering experience for women, yet most women have repeat caesareans. High caesarean section rates increase maternal and neonatal morbidity, health costs and burden on hospitals. Women can experience varied support from health care providers when planning a VBAC. The aim of this paper is to explore the nature and impact of the interactions between women planning a VBAC and health care providers from the womens perspective. METHODS: A national Australian VBAC survey was undertaken in 2019. In total 559 women participated and provided 721 open-ended responses to six questions. Content analysis was used to categorise respondents answers to the open-ended questions. RESULTS: Two main categories were found capturing the positive and negative interactions women had with health care providers. The first main category, Someone in my corner, included the sub-categories belief in women birthing, supported my decisions and respectful maternity care. The negative main category Fighting for my birthing rights included the sub-categories the odds were against me, lack of belief in women giving birth and coercion. Negative interactions included the use of coercive comments such as threats and demeaning language. Positive interactions included showing support for VBAC and demonstrating respectful maternity care.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many cities severely;however, there is significant variance in its impact across cities. Pandemic infection levels are associated with inherent features of cities (e.g., population size, density, mobility patterns, socioeconomic condition, and health & environment), which need to be better understood. Intuitively, the infection levels are expected to be higher in big urban agglomerations, but the measurable influence of a specific urban feature is unclear. The present study examines 41 variables and their potential influence on COVID-19 cases and fatalities. The study uses a multi-method approach to study the influence of variables, classified as demographic, socioeconomic, mobility and connectivity, urban form and density, and health and environment dimensions. This study develops an index dubbed the PVI-CI for classifying the pandemic vulnerability levels of cities, grouping them into five vulnerability classes, from very high to very low. Furthermore, clustering and outlier analysis provides insights on the spatial clustering of cities with high and low vulnerability scores. This study provides strategic insights into levels of influence of key variables upon the spread of infections as well as fatalities, along with an objective ranking for the vulnerability of cities. Thus it provides critical wisdom needed for urban healthcare policy and resource management.

The initial radiological findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia at the early stage on a computed tomography (CT) scan include multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial inflammation, predominantly distributed in the peripheral one-third of the lungs. Gradually, it develops into multiple ground glass opacities and infiltrates in the lungs. Furthermore, pulmonary consolidation is observed, but pleural effusion is rare. Objective From time of presentation to complete recovery, CT scans show significant morphological changes in the lesions, but very few literatures have reported cavitary lesion in the lungs. We present the case of a 64-year-old patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who had typical manifestations of the disease on a CT scan along with constantly changing small cavity in the lung. Discussion Delayed cavitation is a rarely described radiological manifestation of COVID-19. Atypical presentations of COVID-19 raise possibility of other infections or additional diagnoses. Bacterial and fungal infection should be excluded, as well as cavity-causing organisms. Although the proper mechanism of cavitation in COVID-19 pneumonia is not known, it may be due to intra- alveolar hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage, and necrosis of parenchymal cells based on findings of autopsy reports. Early and late complications associated with COVID-19 are yet to be defined. Conclusion Common causes of cavitary lesions must be investigated properly in all patients.

The post-eTSS MM caused vasopressin-analogue-resistant polyuria (VARP) in synchronization with PPP. A 59-year-old man experiencing recurrent headaches and irregular bitemporal hemianopsia over three months was diagnosed with a suprasellar tumor. The suprasellar tumor was an infundibular cyst from the infundibular recess to the posterior lobe of the pituitary, which was gross-totally resected including the neurohypophysis via an extended eTSS. Since awakening from general anesthesia after the gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, the patient continuously had suffered from headache until the 13(th) postoperative day (POD13). The patient took analgesics once a day before the surgery and three times a day after the surgery until POD11. Pyrexia (37.5C39.5 degree Celsius) in synchronization with nonnephrogenic VARP remitted on POD18. Intravenous antibiotics had little effect on changes of pyrexia. Serum procalcitonin values (reference range <0.5 ng/mL) are 0.07 ng/mL on POD12 and 0.06 ng/mL on POD18. His polyuria came to react with sublingual desmopressin after alleviation of pyrexia.

Novel strategies are demanded to control infection, mitigate symptoms and treatment of COVID-19. This is even more imperative given the long sequels that the disease has on the health of the infected. The discovery that S protein includes two ankyrin binding motifs (S-ARBMs) and that the transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV-1) cation channels contain these ankyrin repeat domains (TRPs-ARDs) suggest that TRPV-1, the most studied member of the TRPV channel family, can play a role in binding SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis is strengthened by studies showing that other respiratory viruses bind the TRPV-1 on sensory nerves and epithelial cells in the airways. Furthermore, the pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients is similar to the effects generated by TRPV-1 stimulation. Lastly, treatment with agonists that down-regulate or inactivate TRPV-1 can have a beneficial action on impaired lung functions and clearance of infection. In this review, we explore the role of the TRPV-1 channel in the infection, susceptibility, pathogenesis, and treatment of COVID-19, with the aim of looking at novel strategies to control infection and mitigate symptoms, and trying to translate this knowledge into new preventive and therapeutic interventions.","output":"Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Subtype 1: Potential Role in Infection, Susceptibility, Symptoms and Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus responsible of acute respiratory infection closely related to SARS-CoV has recently emerged.

Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","output":"Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is in response to the article entitled The process of designing for learning: understanding university teachers design work (Bennett et al. in Educ Technol Res Dev 65(1):125C145, 2017).

In response to the need for physical distancing in the age of COVID-19, schools are rapidly shifting to web-based and video technology, sometimes without being able to predict the outcomes of this change. The objectives of this pilot experiment were to (1) compare active learning (AL) methods versus traditional lecture for transmitting and retaining knowledge in the introductory pre-clinical medical school curriculum and (2) weigh whether the costs required to flip instruction were justified by learning gains. The authors took a 2 h lecture for first-year medical students and converted half of it into an AL format. In-person lecture and active learning groups were compared in terms of student knowledge at pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. Costs for first-time delivery and anticipated costs for repeat delivery of each format were calculated. Students gains in knowledge increased in both groups, though more by lecture (control) than via AL. Delivering a single hour of new AL costs 3.4 times that of a new lecture. Repeat offerings of the AL intervention were estimated to cost 5.4 times that of the repeat lecture. The 1 h AL session was less effective than the 1 h lecture for knowledge acquisition and retention at 6-month follow-up. The AL was more expensive to produce and to repeat.

Accumulating evidence suggests that linear ubiquitination plays a crucial role in innate immune signaling and especially in the activation of the NF-B pathway by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains to NF-B essential modulator (NEMO, also called IKK), the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus that has devastated the swine industry worldwide, is an ideal model to study the host's disordered inflammatory responses after viral infection. Here, we found that LUBAC-induced NF-B and proinflammatory cytokine expression can be inhibited in the early phase of PRRSV infection. Screening the PRRSV-encoded proteins showed that nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) suppresses LUBAC-mediated NF-B activation and its CTE domain is required for the inhibition. Mechanistically, nsp1 binds to HOIP/HOIL-1L and impairs the interaction between HOIP and SHARPIN, thus reducing the LUBAC-dependent linear ubiquitination of NEMO. Moreover, PRRSV infection also blocks LUBAC complex formation and NEMO linear-ubiquitination, the important step for transducing NF-B signaling. This unexpected finding demonstrates a previously unrecognized role of PRRSV nsp1 in modulating LUBAC signaling and explains an additional mechanism of immune modulation by PRRSV. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most important veterinary infectious diseases in countries with intensive swine industries. PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection usually suppresses proinflammatory cytokine expression in the early stage of infection, whereas it induces an inflammatory storm in the late stage. However, precisely how the virus is capable of doing so remains obscure. In this study, we found that by blocking the interaction of its catalytic subunit HOIP and accessory molecule SHARPIN, PRRSV can suppress NF-B signal transduction in the early stage of infection. Our findings not only reveal a novel mechanism evolved by PRRSV to regulate inflammatory responses but also highlight the important role of linear ubiquitination modification during virus infection.","output":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus nsp1 Inhibits NF-B Activation by Targeting the Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Negative attitudes and stigmatization can originate from the perception of a disease-related threat.

We found that sexual disgust (but not pathogen nor moral disgust) predicted homonegative attitudes. This effect was stronger for participants expressing higher levels of perceived vulnerability to disease but was not dependent on the perception of the COVID-19 threat. The results reaffirm previous evidence indicating a pivotal role of disgust in disease-avoidance mechanisms. They also point to functional flexibility of the behavioral immune system by demonstrating the moderating role of perceived vulnerability to disease in shaping homonegative attitudes.

Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield.

Relative humidity impacts the evaporation rate and equilibrium size of airborne particles, which in turn may impact particle removal rates and virion viability.

The peculiar SARS-CoV-2-induced endothelitis triggers an intriguing immune-thrombosis that affects both the venous and arterial vascular beds. An increased liability for infection and an increased likelihood of a worse outcome have been observed during the pandemic in patients with active cancer and in cancer survivors. Overlapping commonalities between COVID-19 and Cardio-Oncology have been described that include shared phenotypes of cardiovascular toxicities such as left ventricular dysfunction, ischemic syndromes, conduction disturbances, myocarditis, pericarditis and right ventricular failure; shared pathophysiologic mechanisms such as inflammation, release of cytokines, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-pathway, coagulation abnormalities, microthrombosis and endothelial dysfunction. For these features and for the catalyst role of NCDs (mainly CVD and cancer), we should refer to COVID-19 as a syndemic. Another challenging issue is the persistence of the symptoms, the so-called long COVID whose pathogenesis is still uncertain: it may be due to persistent multi-organ viral attacks or to an abnormal immune response. An intensive vaccination campaign is the most successful pharmacological weapon against SARS-CoV-2, but the increasing number of variants has reduced the efficacy of the vaccines in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections. After a year of vaccinations we have also learned more about efficacy and side-effects of COVID-19 vaccines. An important byproduct of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the rapid expansion of telemedicine platforms across different care settings; this new modality of monitoring cancer patients may be useful even in a post pandemic era. In this paper we analyze the problems that the cardio-oncologists are facing in a pandemic scenario modified by the extensive vaccination campaign and add actionable recommendations derived from the ongoing studies and from the syndemic nature of the infection.","output":"Cardio-Oncology in the COVID Era (Co & Co): The Never Ending Story"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection. Previously, we demonstrated the accuracy of the quantitative LUMIPULSE SARS-CoV-2 antigen test using samples collected retrospectively. Here, the antigen test was clinically validated using prospective samples. Methods A total of 1,033 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected 1,033 individuals and an additional 275 follow-up samples were collected from 43 patients who later tested positive for COVID-19. All 1,308 samples were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and the LUMIPULSE antigen test. Antibody response was investigated for patients with discordant results to clarify whether seroconversion had occurred. Results RT-qPCR identified 990 samples as negative and 43 as positive, while the antigen test identified 992 as negative, 37 as positive, and 4 as inconclusive. The overall concordance rate was 99.7% (1,026/1,029). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the antigen test were 92.5% (37/40), 100% (989/989), 100% (37/37) and of 99.7% (989/992), respectively, after excluding the four inconclusive results. The kappa coefficient was 0.960 (95% confidence interval, 0.892\\\\0.960), suggesting excellent agreement between the two tests. The seropositive in five out of the seven patients with discordant results suggested that the discrepancy was caused by samples collected during the late phase of infection. Using the follow-up samples, we observed a correlation between the antigen level and the viral load or threshold cycle (Ct) value. The concordance rate between these test results tended to be high among samples collected up to 9 days after symptom onset but this gradually decreased thereafter.

Better knowledge of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for their protection. We aimed to identify these risk factors with a focus on care activities. METHODS: We conducted a seroprevalence survey among HCWs in a French referral hospital. Data on COVID-19 exposures, care activities, and protective equipment were collected on a standardized questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 IgG adjusted on potential confounding. FINDINGS: Among the 3,234 HCWs enrolled, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.8%. Risk factors included contact with relatives or HCWs with COVID-19 (OR 2.20 [1.40-3.45] and 2.16 [1.46-3.18], respectively), but not contact with COVID-19 patients. In multivariate analyses, suboptimal use of protective equipment during nasopharyngeal sampling (OR 3.46 [1.15-10.40]), mobilisation of patients in bed (OR 3.30 [1.51-7.25]), clinical examination (OR 2.51 [1.16-5.43]), and eye examination (OR 2.90 [1.01-8.35]) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients washing and dressing and aerosol-generating procedures were additional risk factors, with or without appropriate use of protective equipment (OR 1.37 [1.04-1.81] and 1.74 [1.05-2.88]). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs are i) contact with relatives or HCWs with COVID-19, ii) close or prolonged contact with patients, iii) aerosol-generating procedures. Enhanced protective measures during the two latter care-activities may be warranted.","output":"Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among health care workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus and has been spread globally since it detected in December 2019 Technology take an essential role to combat the virus, including to do contact tracing as a part of health surveillance Even the contact tracing is not a new method to combat a virus disease, however the using of technology has robust attention to data protection and privacy Specific regulation and/or guideline to protect the personal data and privacy on this Covid-19 pandemic is issued by some countries as well as international organization This research aims to examine how the data protection and privacy is response to technology challenge in the Covid-19 pandemic, including in Indonesia Using normative legal research, this research finds out that the utilization of technology to fight the Covid-19, that is the Indonesias official contact tracing, has a legal basis according to the existing regulation and it reflected on the user policy of the apps with some notes However, future research is required to ensure that the apps is protect the users personal data and privacy technically and comparing with other countries as well","output":"Combating Covid-19: Challenge for data protection and privacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper highlights the dark side of power imbalance regarding its consequences in agri-food supplierCbuyer relationships.

SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: Groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 include (but are not limited to) older people, people with multiple long-term conditions, people with disabilities, people from Black, Asian and Ethnic minority groups, people living with obesity, people who are socioeconomically deprived and people living in care homes. All these groups are under-served by clinical research, and there is an urgent need to rectify this if COVID-19 research is to deliver relevant evidence for these groups who are most in need. We provide a framework and checklists for addressing key issues when designing and delivering inclusive COVID-19 research, based on the National Institute for Health Research INnovations in CLinical trial design and delivery for the UnDEr-served project roadmap. Strong community engagement, codevelopment and prioritisation of research questions and interventions are essential. Under-served groups should be represented on funding panels and ethics committees, who should insist on the removal of barriers to participation. Exclusion criteria should be kept to a minimum; intervention delivery and outcome measurement should be simple, flexible and tailored to the needs of different groups, and local advice on the best way to reach and engage with under-served communities should be taken by study delivery teams. Data on characteristics that allow identification of under-served groups must be collected, analyses should include these data to enable subgroup comparisons and results should be shared with under-served groups at an early stage. CONCLUSION: Inclusive COVID-19 research is a necessity, not a luxury, if research is to benefit all the communities it seeks to serve.

In particular, we intended to verify the capability of IMUs to discriminate individuals with and without cognitive impairments and assess the existence of significant correlations between mobility parameters extracted by processing trunk accelerations and cognitive status. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study performed on 213 adults aged over 65 years (mean age 77.0  5.4; 62% female) who underwent cognitive assessment (through Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination Revised, ACE-R) instrumental gait analysis and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test carried out using a wearable IMU located in the lower back. RESULTS: Individuals with cognitive impairments exhibit a peculiar gait pattern, characterized by significant reduction of speed (? 34% vs. healthy individuals), stride length (? 28%), cadence (? 9%), and increase in double support duration (+ 11%). Slight, but significant changes in stance and swing phase duration were also detected. Poorer performances in presence of cognitive impairment were observed in terms of functional mobility as overall and sub-phase TUG times resulted significantly higher with respect to healthy individuals (overall time, + 38%, sub-phases times ranging from + 22 to + 34%), although with some difference associated with age. The severity of mobility alterations was found moderately to strongly correlated with the ACE-R score (Spearmans rho = 0.58 vs. gait speed, 0.54 vs. stride length, 0.66 vs. overall TUG time).

The incompressible NavierCStokes equations characterize a stream of airflow jets, and the convection-diffusion-evaporation process is used to account for the inhomogeneous humidity field caused by the respiratory tract. Momentum equations for droplet dynamics which involve the effects of drag, gravity, and Brownian motion on sputum droplets are introduced to quantify the transport of droplets in a humidity field. The Lattice Boltzmann method is used to track the evolution of the aerosol in space and time under different ambient temperature and relative humidity conditions. The results of the simulation demonstrate that airborne humidity accelerates the evaporation rate of droplet, while supersaturated humid air forms a vapor mass in front of the respiratory tract.

Data collection measures mainly included a demographic questionnaire, COVID-19 vaccine knowledge questionnaire, and the vaccine hesitancy scale. RESULTS: A total of 58.2% of medical students reported vaccine hesitancy. The most common reasons for this were worrying about the side effects of vaccines (44.4%), uncertainty about vaccine safety (40.4%), and underestimating the risk of exposure to COVID-19 (27.9%). The main factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among participants were their knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine, training related to COVID-19 vaccines, family address, and education level (P < 0.05).

The treatment for AAV involves a high burden of immunosuppression. Patients with renal involvement are treated especially intensively. As a result, we identified these patients as being potentially at high risk of failure to seroconvert to COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: We collected data on seroconversion response rates to COVID-19 vaccination in a multi-ethnic cohort of patients with AAV and renal involvement treated at a busy tertiary nephrology centre as part of a retrospective review of patient notes. Blood samples were taken following vaccination with either Pfizer or Astra-Zeneca COVID-19 vaccines and median fluorescence intensity was measured using the validated MULTICOV-Ab Magnetic Luminex(?) Assay. We also evaluated whether seroconversion was affected by immunosuppression regimen. RESULTS: 81 patients were included. The mean age was 62, and there were 49 (60%) females. 55 patients had a blood test after the first dose; 46 after the second dose. Patients were in remission with a median BVAS of 0 (IQR 2). Seroconversion after the first dose with either vaccine was 35/55 (63.6%). After the second it was 38/46 (82.6%). Subgroup analyses revealed a trend to impaired seroconversion in non-white versus white patients (77.8 vs. 81.7% (p = 0.69) after the first dose of vaccine and in those treated with Rituximab in the last 12 months (73.3 vs. 87.1%, p = 0.41). CONCLUSIONS: These data offer real-world evidence of lower seroconversion in response to vaccination with one dose in patients with AAV and renal involvement than the general UK population. After two doses, seroconversion is in line with national data. These data provide a rationale for hospital-led identification of patients most at risk of COVID-19 and underscore the importance of local connexions between hospitals and their communities. These data provide further support for targeting booster vaccination programmes to vulnerable patient cohorts. They add to the growing evidence of reduced seroconversion in response to vaccination in patients with renal disease of any cause.","output":"Response to Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2 in Patients With Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis With Renal Involvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How to cite this article: Sarkar S, Khanna P.

One limitation of Gieres framework, however, is that it covers only one type of scientific reasoning, namely the reasoning deployed in hypothesis-driven research practices. In this paper, we describe an extension of the framework. More specifically, we develop an additional model-based scheme that captures reasoning in application-oriented practices (which are very well represented in contemporary science).

Older adults with underlying health conditions are at an especially high risk of developing life-threatening complications if infected. Most intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and non-ICU hospitalizations have been among patients with at least one underlying health condition. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model to estimate the risk status of the patients of a nationwide pharmacy chain in the United States, and to identify the geographic distribution of patients who have the highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. METHODS: A risk model was developed using a training test split approach to identify patients who are at high risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19. Adult patients (aged &#8805;18 years) were identified from the Walgreens pharmacy electronic data warehouse. Patients were considered eligible to contribute data to the model if they had at least one prescription filled at a Walgreens location between October 27, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Risk parameters included age, whether the patient is being treated for a serious or chronic condition, and urban density classification. Parameters were differentially weighted based on their association with severe complications, as reported in earlier cases. An at-risk rate per 1000 people was calculated at the county level, and ArcMap was used to depict the rate of patients at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Real-time COVID-19 cases captured by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) were layered in the risk map to show where cases exist relative to the high-risk populations. RESULTS: Of the 30,100,826 adults included in this study, the average age is 50 years, 15% have at least one specialty medication, and the average patient has 2 to 3 comorbidities. Nearly 28% of patients have the greatest risk score, and an additional 34.64% of patients are considered high-risk, with scores ranging from 8 to 10. Age accounts for 53% of a patient's total risk, followed by the number of comorbidities (29%); inferred chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or diabetes (15%); and urban density classification (5%). CONCLUSIONS: This risk model utilizes data from approximately 10% of the US population. Currently, this is the most comprehensive US model to estimate and depict the county-level prognosis of COVID-19 infection. This study shows that there are counties across the United States whose residents are at high risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. Our county-level risk estimates may be used alongside other data sets to improve the accuracy of anticipated health care resource needs.

It is involved in the development and maintenance of both innate and systemic immunity of the body. Emerging evidence has shown its role in liver diseases through the immune system cross-talk. We review herein literature data regarding the triangular interaction between gut microbiota, immune system and liver in health and disease. Methods: We conducted a search on the main medical databases for original articles, reviews, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials and case series using the following keywords and acronyms and their associations: gut microbiota, microbiome, gut virome, immunity, gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: The gut microbiota consists of microorganisms that educate our systemic immunity through GALT and non-GALT interactions. The latter maintain health but are also involved in the pathophysiology and in the outcome of several liver diseases, particularly those with metabolic, toxic or immune-mediated etiology. In this context, gut virome has an emerging role in liver diseases and needs to be further investigated, especially due to the link reported between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and hepatic dysfunctions.

This study examined the contextual interpretations of public space users about COVID-19 prevention in Ibadan Metropolis, Oyo State. The study was a rapid ethnographic survey in selected public spaces (markets and commercial motor parks) in Ibadan metropolis. Data were collected through participant observation, key informant interviews (3 females; 3 males) and in-depth interviews (30) with, traders, head porters, clients/buyers and commercial vehicle drivers in these public spaces. Interviews conducted were transcribed, sorted into themes using Atlas-ti 7.5.7 and subjected to interpretive-content analysis. Findings revealed that some respondents felt COVID-19 was brought into Nigeria by rich frequent global voyagers, others felt it was through uncultured sexual life or wrath of God. Some also doubted the existence of the disease and many of the respondents perceived COVID-19 as a disease reported by the government or a political propaganda to siphon funds.

Through this online searchable database, the public can explore physician-industry interactions. To date, there is no published literature on the accuracy of the database for neurosurgeons or any physician specialty. OBJECTIVE To study the accuracy of published records and scope of industry-neurosurgeon relationships between neurosurgeons and industry within the OPD. METHODS We searched 4.3 million records in 2013 and 11.41 million records in 2014 in the OPD for board-certified neurosurgeons verified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery. Delimit software was used to condense these data, Microsoft Access for database queries, and STATA to perform descriptive analyses. RESULTS Of the 3240 neurosurgeons in the OPD in 2013, 2020 were identified correctly as neurosurgeons within the database (62%). Of the 3593 neurosurgeons in the OPD in 2014, 2433 were identified correctly as neurosurgeons (68%). Within the OPD in 2013, there were 72 066 attributed records for neurosurgeons; within the 2014 OPD, there were 160 563 attributed records for neurosurgeons. Total payments to neurosurgeons in 2013 (for the 9 months published in OPD): $61 802 659.37; in 2014: $117 127 824.00. CONCLUSION The OPD details physician interactions with industry and has multiple inaccuracies. Publicly availing inaccurate information through a searchable governmental website that can be accessed by patients and journalists alike has the potential to tarnish individual neurosurgeons and undermine professional credibility.

This study aimed to determine the acceptance and hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine and associated factors among medical students in Sudan. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire designed on Google Form and sent to randomly-selected medical students via their Telegram accounts from 30(th) June to 11(th) July 2021. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. Chi-square or Fishers exact test and logistic regression were used to assess the association between vaccine acceptance and demographic as well as non-demographic factors. RESULTS: Out of the 281 students who received the questionnaire, 220 (78%) responded, of whom 217 consented and completed the form. Males accounted for 46. 1%. Vaccine acceptance was 55. 8% (n = 121), and vaccine hesitancy was 44. 2% (n = 96). The commonly cited reasons for accepting the vaccine were to protect themselves and others from getting COVID-19. Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness were the main reasons reported by those who were hesitant. Factors associated with vaccine acceptance were history of COVID-19 infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2. 2, 95% CI 1. 0C4.7, p = 0. 040), belief that vaccines are generally safe (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI 1. 2C4.5, p = 0.020), confidence that the vaccine can end the pandemic (aOR = 7.5, 95% CI 2. 5C22. 0, p<0.001), and receiving any vaccine in the past 5 years (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.1C5.4, p = 0.031).

METHODS: We assessed anxiety and depression symptoms using two validated questionnaires in 413,148 individuals between February and April 2021; 26,998 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We adjusted for physical and mental pre-pandemic comorbidities, BMI, age, and sex. FINDINGS: Overall, 26.4% of participants met screening criteria for general anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression were slightly more prevalent in previously SARS-CoV-2 positive (30.4%) vs. negative (26.1%) individuals. This association was small compared to the effect of an unhealthy BMI and the presence of other comorbidities, and not evident in younger participants (40 years). Findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. Association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anxiety and depression was stronger in individuals with recent (<30 days) vs. more distant (>120 days) infection, suggesting a short-term effect.

This report describes a virus identification method featuring high throughput, high resolution, and high sensitivity detection of viruses. Identification of virus is based on liquid hybridization of different lengths of virus-specific probes to their corresponding viruses. The probes bound to target sequences are removed by a biotinCstreptavidin pull-down mechanism and the supernatant is analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The probes depleted from the sample appear as diminished peaks in the electropherograms and the remaining probes serve as calibrators to align peaks in different capillaries. The virus identities are unraveled by a signal processing and peak detection algorithm developed in-house. Nine viruses were used in the study to demonstrate how the system works to unravel the virus identity in single and double virus infections. With properly designed probes, the system is able to distinguish closely related viruses. The system takes advantage of the high resolution feature of capillary electrophoresis to resolve probes that differ by length. The method may facilitate virus identity screen from more candidate viruses with an automated 4-color DNA sequencer.","output":"Unraveling virus identity by detection of depleted probes with capillary electrophoresis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This review will assess the effectiveness of neonatal near-miss audits in reducing perinatal mortality and morbidity, as implemented in health care facilities. INTRODUCTION Every year, 2.5 million newborns die and 2.6 million more are stillborn worldwide. While many perinatal deaths are preventable, their reduction has been markedly slower than the decline of maternal or child mortality rates. It is hypothesized that neonatal near miss is part of the spectrum of stillbirth-neonatal death and that auditing these cases might reduce perinatal mortality and morbidity. INCLUSION CRITERIA This review will consider neonatal near-miss audits implemented in health care facilities worldwide. Randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series, case-control, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and case series will be included. Conference abstracts, letters, studies duplicating validation data from previous studies, gray literature, and unpublished studies will be excluded.

Objective: To determine the real-life clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. Design: A retrospective study on case series from 4 March - 15 April 2020. Setting: A population-based study conducted in primary and tertiary care in the Helsinki Capital Region, Finland. Participants: Adults who were clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, and who had sufficient data for grading of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in their medical records were eligible. All 1,194 inpatients admitted to COVID-19 cohort wards during the study period were included. The outpatient cohort of 1,814 individuals was sampled from epidemiological line lists by systematic quasi-random sampling. Altogether 83 eligible outpatients (4.6%) and 3 inpatients (0.3%) were excluded due to insufficient data for grading of clinical suspicion. Exposures: High clinical suspicion for COVID-19 was used as the reference standard for the RT-PCR test. Patients were considered to have high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 if the physician in charge recorded the suspicion on clinical grounds, or the patient fulfilled specifically defined clinical and exposure criteria. Main measures: Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR by using manually curated clinical characteristics as the gold standard. Results: The study population included 1,814 outpatients (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [17.2] years; 69.1% women) and 1,194 inpatients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [18.3] years; 45.2% women). The sensitivity (95% CI) for laboratory confirmed cases, i.e. repeatedly tested patients were as follows: 85.7% (81.5-89.1%) inpatients; 95.5% (92.2-97.5%) outpatients, 89.9% (88.2-92.1%) all. When also patients that were graded as high suspicion but never tested positive were included in the denominator, the following sensitivity values (95% CI) were observed: 67.5% (62.9-71.9%) inpatients; 34.9% (31.4-38.5%) outpatients; 47.3% (44.4-50.3%) all. Conclusions and relevance: The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was only moderate at best. The relatively high false negative rates of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing need to be accounted for in clinical decision making, epidemiological interpretations and when using RT-PCR as a reference for other tests.","output":"Real-life clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test in symptomatic patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the association between neck muscles pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and forward head posture (FHP) in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).

Informations of FHP and neck muscles PPT were collected for all participants. FHP was characterized by the craniocervical angle (CVA) between C7, the tragus of the ear and the horizontal line. Each of the participants completed a questionaire of the neck disability index (NDI). The patients with CVA&#8804;51  were asigned into FHP group, otherwise the patients with CVA>51 were asigned into non-FHP group. PPT were measured at the midpoint of the upper trapezius and 1 cm aside from C5-C6 articular pillars. Nonparametric test and Spearman correlation analysis were conducted for the data analysis. Results: There were 70 patients in the FHP group and 75 patients in the non-FHP group. The trapezius PPT of the FHP group [2.82(0.86) kg] was significantly higher than that of the non-FHP group [2.46(0.80) kg] (P<0.01). No significant differences in PPT and NDI were observed between the two groups (P>0.05). Low correlation was found between trapezius PPT and FHP negatively (r=-0.273, P<0.01) and no correlation was found between C5-C6 PPT and FHP (r=-0.124, P>0.05).

METHODS: This study included children and adolescents with underlying hematological malignancies and respiratory symptoms, in whom a multiplex PCR test was performed. Patients in whom RVI was identified and not identified were categorized into Groups I and II, respectively. Group I was sub-divided into patients with upper and lower respiratory infections. The medical records of the enrolled patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 93 respiratory illnesses were included. Group I included 46 (49.5%) cases of RVI, including 31 (67.4%) upper and 15 (32.6%) lower respiratory infections. Rhinovirus (37.0%) was the most common viral pathogen. Significantly more patients in Group I had community-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003) and complained of rhinorrhea (p<0.001) and sputum (p=0.008) than those in Group II.

The rapid turnover of the latest epidemic wave in South Africa as well as initial evidence from contact tracing and household infection studies has prompted speculation that the generation time of the Omicron variant may be shorter in comparable settings than the generation time of the Delta variant. Methods We estimated daily growth rates for the Omicron and Delta variants in each UKHSA region from the 23rd of November to the 23rd of December 2021 using surveillance case counts by date of specimen and S-gene target failure status with an autoregressive model that allowed for time-varying differences in the transmission advantage of the Delta variant where the evidence supported this. By assuming a gamma distributed generation distribution we then estimated the generation time distribution and transmission advantage of the Omicron variant that would be required to explain this time varying advantage. We repeated this estimation process using two different prior estimates for the generation time of the Delta variant first based on household transmission and then based on its intrinsic generation time. Results Visualising our growth rate estimates provided initial evidence for a difference in generation time distributions. Assuming a generation time distribution for Delta with a mean of 2.5-4 days (90% credible interval) and a standard deviation of 1.9-3 days we estimated a shorter generation time distribution for Omicron with a mean of 1.5-3.2 days and a standard deviation of 1.3-4.6 days. This implied a transmission advantage for Omicron in this setting of 160%-210% compared to Delta. We found similar relative results using an estimate of the intrinsic generation time for Delta though all estimates increased in magnitude due to the longer assumed generation time. Conclusions We found that a reduction in the generation time of Omicron compared to Delta was able to explain the observed variation over time in the transmission advantage of the Omicron variant. However, this analysis cannot rule out the role of other factors such as differences in the populations the variants were mixing in, differences in immune escape between variants or bias due to using the test to test distribution as a proxy for the generation time distribution.","output":"Estimation of the test to test distribution as a proxy for generation interval distribution for the Omicron variant in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to describe the theoretical construction process of nursing process support documents in COVID-19 care scenarios.

A scale of assessment of basic motor skills was used to evaluate their motor skills. The BMI data revealed that 11% of this sample was considered obese, and 26% was overweight. Children showed higher competence in locomotor skills than in object control and turn and rolling skills, for which motor competence levels were lower. Likewise, there was an inverse relationship between BMI and basic motor skills; children with obesity had the lowest levels of motor skills, and there was a significant difference regarding non-obese children (p  0.05). These results showed that overweight and obese children have lower basic motor skills, which can lead to the abandonment of physical activity and the preference for other activities that reinforce a sedentary lifestyle.","output":"There Is an Inverse Correlation between Basic Motor Skills and Overweight in Schoolchildren Aged 8 to 12"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by multiple organ damage and the production of a variety of autoantibodies. The pathogenesis of SLE has not been fully defined, and it is difficult to treat. Our study aimed to identify candidate genes that may be used as biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of SLE. METHODS: We used the GEO2R tool to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SLE-related datasets retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In addition, we also identified the biological functions of the DEGs by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. Additionally, we constructed proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) networks to identify hub genes, as well as the regulatory network of transcription factors related to DEGs. RESULTS: Two datasets were identified for use from the GEO (GSE50772, GSE4588), and 34 up-regulated genes and 4 down-regulated genes were identified by GEO2R. Pathway analysis of the DEGs revealed enrichment of the interferon alpha/beta signaling pathway; GO analysis was mainly enriched in response to interferon alpha, regulation of ribonuclease activity. PPIs were constructed through the STRING database and 14 hub genes were selected and 1 significant module (score = 12.923) was obtained from the PPI network. Additionally, 11 key transcription factors that interacted closely with the 14 hub DEGs were identified from the gene transcription factor network. CONCLUSIONS: Bioinformatic analysis is an effective tool for screening the original genomic data in the GEO database, and a large number of SLE-related DEGs were identified.

Despite its increasing popularity and safety, the abdominal donor site remains a major source of postoperative pain. Conventional postoperative pain relief protocol consists primarily of a patient-controlled anesthesia device delivering intravenous opioids. Opioids can cause numerous side effects such as sedation, headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties and bladder and bowel dysfunction. A promising approach to provide postoperative pain control of the abdominal incision is the newly developed transversus abdominis plane peripheral nerve block. METHODS/DESIGN This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial designed to rigorously test the effectiveness of a transversus abdominis plane catheter delivering intermittent local anesthetic in reducing postoperative abdominal pain following abdominal tissue breast reconstruction. The primary objective of this study is compare the mean total opioid consumption in the first postoperative 48 hours between the control and study groups including the patient-controlled anesthesia amounts and oral narcotic doses converted to intravenous morphine equivalent units. The secondary outcome measures include the following parameters: total in-hospital cumulative opioid consumption; daily patient-reported pain scores; total in-hospital cumulative anti-nausea consumption; nausea and sedation scores; and Quality of Recovery score; time to first bowel movement, ambulation, and duration of hospital stay. DISCUSSION Autologous breast reconstruction using abdominal tissue is rapidly becoming the reconstructive option of choice for postmastectomy patients across North America. A substantial component of the pain experienced by patients after this abdominally based procedure is derived from the abdominal wall incision. By potentially decreasing the need for systemic opioids and their associated side effects, this transversus abdominis plane block study will utilize the most scientifically rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial methodology to potentially improve both clinical care and health outcomes in breast cancer surgery patients.

METHODS: We here compare the number of patients who underwent surgery in Chongqing Medical University Affiliated Childrens Hospital during the pandemic (January 23CMarch 11), after the pandemic (March 12CApril 30), after our measures were put in place (May 1CMay 21), and the equivalent period in 2019. RESULT: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 62.68% fewer patients underwent surgery than during the homologous period of time 1 year earlier (P < 0.01). After the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of orchidopexy cases increased significantly from 175.14 to 504.57 per week (P < 0.01). The large number of patients that accrued in our hospital may have increased the risk of COVID-19 transmission. In response, hospitals and clinics have made protocols and reorganized healthcare facilities (e.g., performing nucleic acid tests (NAT), adding adequate personal protective equipment (PPE)) from May 1, 2020. After the measures were implemented, the number of operations performed remained stable and comparable to the pre-pandemic period. COVID-19 RNA detection was performed in 5104 cases and there were no new confirmed cases in our hospital.

To achieve optimal effect, the LCIG dose is individually titrated, traditionally conducted during hospitalization in Sweden. However, dose adjustment depends on surrounding conditions, physical activity, and emotional stress, which is why titration at home could be beneficial. Telemedicine (TM) using a video communication system offers alternative titration procedures, allowing LCIG initiation at home. OBJECTIVE Study objectives were to show the feasibility of TM for LCIG home titration, evaluate resource use, and assess patient, neurologist, and nurse satisfaction. METHODS Four clinics enrolled 15 patients to observe efficiency and feasibility of TM-based monitoring. RESULTS Patient median (range) age was 67 (52-73) years and time since diagnosis was 10 (7-23) years. Median time between LCIG initiation and end of TM-assisted titration was 2.8 (2.0-13.8) days. Median time required for home titration by neurologists, nurses, and patients was (hours:minutes) 1 : 14 (0 : 29-1 : 52), 5 : 49 (2 : 46-10 : 3), and 8 : 53 (4 : 11-14 : 11), respectively. Neurologists and nurses considered this to be less time than required for hospital titration. TM allowed patients 92% free time from start to end of titration. Technical problems associated with TM contacts were rare, mostly related to digital link, and quickly resolved. Patients, neurologists, and nurses were satisfied using TM. No serious adverse events were reported; there was one device complaint (tube occlusion). CONCLUSIONS In this study, TM-assisted LCIG titration at home was resource-efficient, technically feasible, well-accepted and was deemed satisfactory by patients, neurologists, and nurses.","output":"Initiation of Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel Infusion Using Telemedicine (Video Communication System) Facilitates Efficient and Well-Accepted Home Titration in Patients with Advanced Parkinson's Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeHumanitarian logistics has for a long time been argued to be a new discipline.

Transfusion of allogeneic blood, while necessary, is not benign, and has been associated with increased rates of wound complication, venous thromboembolism, delirium, and death. PURPOSE To develop a prediction tool capable of predicting IOBL and risk of requiring allogeneic transfusion in patients undergoing surgery for vertebral column tumors. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Retrospective, single-center study PATIENT SAMPLE: Consecutive series of 274 patients undergoing 350 unique operations for primary or metastatic spinal column tumors over a 46-month period at a comprehensive cancer center OUTCOME MEASURES: IOBL (in mL), use of intraoperative blood products, and intraoperative blood products transfused METHODS: We identified IOBL and transfusions, along with demographic data, pre-operative laboratory data, and surgical procedures performed. Independent predictors of IOBL and transfusion risk were identified using multivariable regression. RESULTS Mean age at surgery was 57.013.6 years, 53.1% were male, and 67.1% were treated for metastatic lesions. Independent predictors of IOBL included en bloc resection (p<0.001), surgical invasiveness (=25.43 per point; p<0.001), and pre-operative albumin (= -244.86 per g/dL; p=0.011). Predictors of transfusion risk included pre-operative hematocrit (odds ratio=0.88 per %; 95% confidence interval [0.84, 0.93]; p<0.001), pre-operative MCHgb (OR=0.88 per pg; 95%CI [0.78, 1.00]; p=0.048), preoperative red cell distribution width (OR=1.32 per %; 95%CI [1.13, 1.55]; p<0.001), en bloc resection (OR=3.17; 95%CI [1.33, 7.54]; p=0.009), and surgical invasiveness (OR=1.08 per point; [1.06; 1.11]; p<0.001).

To establish convergent validity for the VBLaST-PC?, we assessed trainees' learning curves using the cumulative summation (CUSUM) method and compared them with those on the FLS. METHODS Twenty-four medical students were randomly assigned to an FLS training group, a VBLaST training group, or a control group. Fifteen training sessions, 30 min in duration per session per day, were conducted over 3 weeks. All subjects completed pretest, posttest, and retention test (2 weeks after posttest) on both the FLS and VBLaST? simulators. Performance data, including time, error, FLS score, learning rate, learning plateau, and CUSUM score, were analyzed. RESULTS The learning curve for all trained subjects demonstrated increasing performance and a performance plateau. CUSUM analyses showed that five of the seven subjects reached the intermediate proficiency level but none reached the expert proficiency level after 150 practice trials. Performance was significantly improved after simulation training, but only in the assigned simulator. No significant decay of skills after 2 weeks of disuse was observed. Control subjects did not show any learning on the FLS simulator, but improved continually in the VBLaST simulator. CONCLUSIONS Although VBLaST?- and FLS-trained subjects demonstrated similar learning rates and plateaus, the majority of subjects required more than 150 trials to achieve proficiency. Trained subjects demonstrated improved performance in only the assigned simulator, indicating specificity of training. The virtual simulator may provide better opportunities for learning, especially with limited training exposure.","output":"Validation of the VBLaST pattern cutting task: a learning curve study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The studies show how replacing soybean meal with soybean expeller cake or extruded full-fat soybean in feed rations for broiler chickens affects rearing results (weight gain, intake and conversion of feed), carcass composition (dressing percentage, musculature, fattens) and meat quality (physical properties: pH, colour, water holding capacity; the chemical composition: basic components, fatty acids and organoleptic value: flavour, tenderness, palatability and juiciness). Based on the results the use of soybean expeller cake in broiler chicken starter/grower diets can be recommended as it allowed for obtaining the best production and slaughter results. However, from the point of view of the human diet, extruded full-fat soybean should be suggested since it best modified the lipid fraction of muscles. ABSTRACT: The study aimed to determine the overall effect of replacing soybean meal completely with soybean expeller cake or extruded full-fat soybean in feed rations for broiler chickens on their carcass composition and meat quality. The experiment involved one hundred and twenty Ross 308 broiler chickens randomly allocated to three equinumerous groups (SBM, SEC, EFS). Each group was divided into five subgroupseach consisting of eight birds of both sexes (1:1). From Day 1 to Day 21 of life the birds were fed with loose starter rations, and from Day 22 to Day 42 they were fed grower rations based on a wheat meal, protein products and mineral and vitamin admixtures. The experimental factor was a protein raw material comprising: SBM groupsoybean meal from GM (genetically modified) seeds, SECsoybean expeller cake from n-GM seeds, and EFSextruded full-fat soybean from n-GM seeds. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. It was demonstrated that replacing soybean meal with SEC or EFS in feed rations for broiler chickens led to a significant (p < 0.05) weight gain on Day 42 of rearing by 4.57% and 2.88%, respectively. The chickens fed diets with EFS had worse (more than 4.14%) feed conversion rate (FCR) in comparison to the others (p < 0.05). Broiler chickens from the SBM and SEC groups showed a higher share of breast and leg muscles (by 4.74% and 7.54%) and a lower share of abdominal fat (by 31.1%) and skin with subcutaneous fat (by 18.8% and 13.4%) in comparison with birds from the EFS group (p < 0.05). The highest content of intramuscular fat with the best fatty acids profile was determined in the muscles of birds fed with diets containing EFS, while the muscles of chickens receiving SEC scored the highest. The results provide grounds for recommending SEC in broiler chicken nutrition as it allowed for obtaining the best production and slaughter results, whereasfrom the point of view of the human dietEFS should be recommended since it best modified the lipid fraction of muscles.","output":"Efficiency of Soybean Products in Broiler Chicken Nutrition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concept of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) brings the opportunity to adjust both the study content, and the context, based on the teaching needs Therefore, in this paper, we present our best practices on enabling remote networking laboratories via Blackboard platform, including the Blackboard Collaborate Ultra extension, in order to efficiently react to the challenges of imminent campus closure imposed by COVID-19 breakout We present an extensive survey as a feedback from students, which allowed us to measure and to quantify students' experience and satisfaction with the remote teaching setup that successfully served 45 enrolled students As the results bring the positive attitude towards practices presented in this paper, such teaching practices will foster some of the critical skills nowadays, such as collaboration, self-driven learning, and problem solving, and they can also serve as a successful example on how to efficiently cope with the limited access to traditional classroom resources within various courses ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Reacting to COVID-19 campus imminent closure: Enabling remote networking laboratories via MOOCs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Officially, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Ukraine in March 2020 and came to Ukraine at a time when the national economy was not in the best condition In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed not only the structure of the national economy, but also the way of doing business This is evidenced by indicators that reflect changes in the structure of gross domestic product, changes in the structure of employment and marketing tools The COVID-19 pandemic has already led to a financial crisis and a crisis in certain areas and sectors of the economy, but there are those who have benefited from quarantine measures However, there are industries and areas of activity for which the COVID-19 pandemic has given a good start and revenue growth Timely response and targeted action will reduce the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, prevent a decline in business activity, create conditions for the development of Ukrainian manufacturers and reduce the impact of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Copyright ? 2020 by authors, all rights reserved","output":"Education in Ukraine and Covid-19: New perspectives and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: After the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of thrombosis and bleeding has been an important issue.

Methods: We collected the clinical data of 24 patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the isolation ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College from January, 2020 to February 20, 2020, and evaluated the data of clinical characteristics, blood test results, inflammatory index, chest CT imaging characteristics, and antiviral treatment, comparing this with the clinical data of 41 patients with moderate condition in the same period. From this comparison we thus summarized the current knowledge of potential risk factors for COVID-19 patients developing from moderate to severe condition. Results: (1) Clinical characteristics: The moderate-to-severe group and the moderate group in terms of combined common underlying diseases and respiratory frequency showed significant difference statistically (t-value were 13.32, 6.17, respectively, P < 0.05), while no significant difference between the two groups in gender, age, or clinical symptoms was statistically observed(P > 0.05). (2) Analysis of blood test results: The lymphocyte count and plasma albumin of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly lower than those of the moderate group (t-values were 4.16, 4.11, respectively, P < 0.05), and the blood glucose and urea of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly higher than those of the moderate group (t-value were 3.27, 4.19, respectively, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in terms of white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) (P > 0.05). (3) Comparison of inflammatory indicators: The level of IL-6 and CRP of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly higher than those of the moderate group (t-values were 2.84, 4.88, respectively, P < 0.05). (4) Imaging comparison: As for patients with moderate COVID-19, the imaging manifestations were the concurrence of ground-glass opacity, patchy shadow, and consolidation shadow in both lungs, diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lungs accompanied by air bronchogram, and large area consolidation of both lungs with pulmonary interstitial changes. The possibility for these patients to develop into severe condition increased, and the differences were statistically significant (t = 10.92, P < 0.05). (5) Clinical antiviral treatment: There was no statistically significant difference in the combination of two or three antiviral drugs between the two groups ((2) = 0.05, P > 0.05). Conclusion: Current evidence suggested that the combination of common underlying diseases, respiratory frequency, lymphocyte count, blood glucose, albumin, urea level, inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-6), and imaging manifestations collectively contributed to the potential risk factors for the development of COVID-19 from moderate condition to severe condition.

Health beliefs play an important role in the development of health behaviors. In this study, the effect of educational intervention based on Health Belief Model on colorectal cancer screening behavior was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed as a randomized controlled intervention. The study population was 50C70-years old in Khosf city. Initially, 120 eligible populations were randomly divided into intervention and control groups (60 people in each group). The data collection tool was a standard colorectal cancer screening questionnaire that was completed before, immediately, and 3 months after the intervention. The intervention consisted of eight 60-min training sessions. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS19 software and statistical tests. RESULTS: The mean age of the intervention and control groups was 63.53  5.67 and 57.73  5.77 years. In terms of mean scores of knowledge, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and perceived barriers were homogeneous before intervention. After the intervention, the mean score of the model constructs showed significant changes, which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The rate of occult blood test in stool 3 months after training reached 90% in the intervention group and 15% in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that by taking measures to reduce perceived barriers as well as increase knowledge, perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits and self-efficacy, the rate of participation in occult blood testing in feces can be significantly increased.","output":"Evaluation of health belief model-based educational intervention on colorectal cancer screening behavior at South Khorasan, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 19 has resulted in morbidity and mortality among those that contracted the disease especially among health care workers (HCW) who are involved in the management of the infected patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the level of knowledge of COVID-19 among health care workers and their willingness to treat infected patients. METHODOLOGY This cross sectional, self-administered questionnaire-based study was conducted among health care workers in a Nigerian urban community. The questionnaires obtained information on social-demographic profile, knowledge of COVID-19 and the willingness to treat infected COVID-19 patients. Data were analyzed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions Version 21 for windows. Tables were presented in form of frequencies and percentages. Chis-quared statistics was used to compare the difference between groups while the level of significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS A total of 408 health care workers participated in this study, of which 276 were males (67.6%) and 132 females (32.4%). The age range of 31- 40years (42.5%) was more in practice. Majority (68.4%) of the participants had adequate knowledge regarding COVID-19 (Table 2). About 17.6% of the participants were willing to treat infected patients. There was a statistically significant difference between the willingness to treat COVID-19 patients and the fear of being infected among all the HCW.

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 3218 COVID-19 confirmed patients admitted to a major healthcare system (three hospitals) in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and particularly data of all neurological symptoms were extracted from the imaging reports. Four neuroradiologists evaluated all neuroimaging studies for acute neuroimaging findings related to COVID-19. RESULTS: 14.1% of admitted COVID-19 patients had neuroimaging and this accounted for only 5.5% of the total imaging studies. Acute stroke was the most common finding on neuro-imaging, seen in 92.5% of patients with positive neuro-imaging studies, and present in 1.1% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with acute large ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke had much higher mortality risk adjusted for age, BMI and hypertension compared to those COVID-19 patients without neuroimaging. (Odds Ratio 6.02 by LR; Hazard Ratio 2.28 by CRR). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates acute stroke is the most common neuroimaging finding among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Complement activation has been associated with COVID-19 severity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether chromosome 3p21.31 and the ABO variants are linked to the activation of the complement cascade in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We considered 72 unrelated European hospitalized patients with genetic data and evaluation of circulating C5a and soluble terminal complement complex C5b-9 (SC5b-9). Twenty-six (36.1%) patients carried the rs11385942 G>GA variant and 44 (66.1%) non-O blood group associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. RESULTS: C5a and SC5-b9 plasma levels were higher in rs11385949 GA carriers than in non-carriers (P = 0.041 and P = 0.012, respectively), while C5a levels were higher in non-O group than in O group patients (P = 0.019). The association between rs11385949 and SC5b-9 remained significant after adjustment for ABO and disease severity (P = 0.004) and further correction for C5a (P = 0.018). There was a direct relationship between upper airways viral load and SC5b-9 in carriers of the rs11385949 risk allele (P = 0.032), which was not observed in non-carriers.

Patients: Patients with confirmed positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 using polymerase chain reaction testing. Patients from the Stony Brook University Hospital data were used for training (80%, N = 1,002) and testing (20%, N = 250), and 375 patients from the Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) data were used for testing.

A predictive model using the significant earliest predictors was constructed. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (AUC). The predictive model found lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, procalcitonin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, respiratory rate, and white-blood cells to be early predictors of mortality. The AUC for the zero to 9 days prior to outcome were: 0.99, 0.96, 0.94, 0.90, 0.82, 0.75, 0.73, 0.77, 0.79, and 0.73, respectively (Stony Brook Hospital), and 1.0, 0.86, 0.88, 0.96, 0.91, 0.62, 0.67, 0.50, 0.63, and 0.57, respectively (Tongji Hospital).

It is a challenge to provide consistent care in this situation, highly demanding and leading to potential staff shortages in ICU. We need to reduce unnecessary exposure of healthcare workers to the virus. This study aims to examine the impact of care using a non-invasive oscillating device (NIOD) for chest physiotherapy in the care of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. In particular, we aim to explore if a NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard chest physiotherapy (CPT) undertaken by physiotherapists caring for patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A pilot multicenter prospective crossover noninferiority randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 admitted to one of the two ICUs, and CPT ordered by the responsible physician. The participants will be recruited from two intensive care units in Canadian Academic Hospitals (one pediatric and one adult ICU). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: We will implement NIOD and CPT alternatingly for 3 h apart over 3 h. We will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including hypertonic saline nebulization, intermittent positive pressure ventilation, suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the ventilator settings or modality (i.e., increasing positive end-expiratory pressure or changing the nasal mask to total face continuous positive airway pressure) can be provided at the direction of bedside intensivists in charge. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measurement is the oxygenation level before and after the procedure (SpO2/FiO2 ratio). For cases with invasive ventilation (i.e., the use of an endotracheal tube to deliver positive pressure) and non-invasive ventilation, we will also document expiratory tidal volume, vital signs, and any related complications such as vomiting, hypoxemia, or unexpected extubation. We will collect the data before, 10 min after, and 30 min after the procedure. RANDOMIZATION: The order of the procedures (i.e., NIOD or CPT) will be randomly allocated using manual generated random numbers for each case. Randomization will be carried out by the independent research assistant in the study coordinating center by using opaque sealed envelopes, assigning an equal number of cases to each intervention arm.

This study aimed to assess the impact of patients' fear on orthopedic surgeries in Taiwan amid the peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS The investigation period included the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to April 2020) and the corresponding period in the previous year. The following data on patients with orthopedic diseases were collected: outpatient visits, hospital admission, and surgical modalities. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic led to a 22%-29% and 20%-26% reduction in outpatients, 22%-27% and 25%-37% reduction in admissions, and 26%-35% and 18%-34% reduction in surgeries, respectively, at both hospitals. The weekly mean number of patients was significantly smaller during the COVID-19 pandemic for all types of surgery and elective surgeries at the university hospital, and for all types of surgery, elective surgeries, and total knee arthroplasties at the community hospital. Further, patients visiting the community hospital during the pandemic were significantly younger, for all types of surgery, elective surgeries, and total knee arthroplasties. CONCLUSIONS The reduction in orthopedic surgeries in Taiwan's hospitals during COVID-19 could be attributed to patients' fear. Even without restriction, the pandemic inevitably led to a reduction of about 20%-30% of the operation volume.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related psychological effect on orthopedic surgeries conducted in different types of hospitals in Taiwan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Direct contact with nature is paramount in deepening childrens and teenagers interest in biodiversity. Learning materials chosen to convey information and engage participants during outings in nature-rich environments are varied and can support rich learning experiences. For this purpose, learning materials can be acquired \\"off-the-shelf\\" or developed for site-specific locations or projects. However, there is little guidance on potential techniques for those wishing to generate contextually relevant materials. With the view of responding to this challenge, we propose the cultural probes technique. We demonstrate that the technique, commonly used in qualitative research to generate novel insights in conversation with participants, can instigate innovative and thoughtful approaches to materials designed for children and teenagers to explore nature. We present a toolkit that draws on the literature on cultural probes, inquiry-based learning, and the value of sensory, emotional, and aesthetic experiences in environmental education for structuring interactions with participants. To test our approach, we applied a descriptive research design and mixed-methods approach for collecting questions from youths between the ages of 10 and 18, inspired by a nature walk and a set of exploratory tasks executed through the toolkit. Specifically, we tested our toolkit along a trail in the Nature Park of Terceira, situated in the Azores, a Portuguese volcanic archipelago in the North Atlantic. Here, we present and reflect on the data collected during one visit organized over two days with two groups of participants and one post-trail activity directed at both groups. Results demonstrate that the open-ended and playful nature of cultural probes offers a novel way to engage youths with nature-rich environments through questioning. This contribution further highlights the potential of cultural probes for instigating encounters that tap into the value of sensory, emotional, and aesthetic experience in nature, with positive outcomes for participants.","output":"Cultural probes for environmental education: Designing learning materials to engage children and teenagers with local biodiversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Diet is a modifiable behavior of interest in multiple sclerosis (MS); however, measures of diet in persons with MS have not been vetted for feasibility, acceptability, and validity. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined the Automated Self-Administered 24-H (ASA24) Dietary Assessment Tool in 30 persons with MS and 15 healthy control (HC) participants. Participants were prompted to complete six ASA24 recalls and undergo a standard doubly labeled water (DLW) protocol. Acceptability of ASA24 was assessed using an online questionnaire. Total energy expenditure (TEE) from DLW was compared with ASA24-reported energy intake for assessing validity. Results: All participants completed four or more ASA24 recalls, indicating feasibility of ASA24. Regarding acceptability, the hardest part of completing the ASA24 was remembering everything eaten the previous day. Pearson correlation coefficients between DLW TEE and ASA24 kcal/day were not significant among HC (r = 0.40; p = 0.14) or MS (r = 0.26; p = 0.16) participants. The absolute mean error between DLW TEE and ASA24 among HC participants was 694.96  506.25 mean kcal/day and among MS participants was 585.37  529.02 mean kcal/day; this represents a mean difference of 30 and 25%, respectively.

However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.","output":"Unifying evolutionary and thermodynamic information for RNA folding of multiple alignments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction:Vitamin D is known as a vitamin but also it acts as a prohormone and has many functions The aim of this study is to investigate the vitamin D levels in pediatric patients with COVID-19 Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was performed in a tertiary education and research hospital in Istanbul, Turkey during the period of Marcht o April 2020 Children diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 infection were included in the study Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings were recorded from patient charts retrospectively All patients investigated for vitamin D levels Control group consists of healthy children admitted to pediatric outpatient units for routine check-up in the same season Thirty children with COVID-19 and 82 healthy children included in this study were compared due to 25-OH vitamin D levels Results: The median age of COVID-19 positive patients was 11 8 (1 8-17 6) years and the median age of control group was 12 7 (1-16 4) years old There were 15 (50%) females and 15 (50%) males in infected group and there were 39 (47 5%) females and 43 (52 5%) males control group Age and gender did not differ among the groups Median vitamin D level in COVID-19 positive group was 8 9 ng/ml (342 ng/ml) and 18 5 ng/ml (9-40 7 ng/ml) in control group We detected significantly lower vitamin D values in COVID19(+) group when compared with control group (p&lt;0 001) CT was performed 19 patients in COVID-19 positive group and viral pneumonia was detected in 12(63%) of 19 pneumonia (+) group a 17 4-years-old female patient and a 13 1-years-old male patient had low phosphorus levels by age (2 2 and 2 4 mg/dl) Both of them needed high flow oxygen therapy None of the other cases needed oxygen therapy Conclusions: This is the first study to date has measured vitamin D levels in children with COVID-19 in Turkey We detected significantly lower vitamin D values in COVID-19(+) hospitalized children ? 2021, Galenos All rights reserved","output":"Vitamin d levels of covid-19 positive sypmtomatic pediatric cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To determine the relationship and prevalence of taste and smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 in the UAE population Methods Enrolled participants were interviewed online via a phone call after obtaining their informed consent Quantification of smell, taste, and other sensations before, during, and after COVID-19 infection was correlated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms Results A total of 500 (mild C severe) COVID-19 patients completed the survey A total of 26 4% were asymptomatic, and 21 4% were classified as paucisymptomatic with less severe symptoms Almost equal proportions of the studied population experienced extreme taste sensation reductions (43%) and loss of smell sensation (44%) Statistically significant drastic decreases in smell and taste senses were seen among younger ages The magnitude of reduction in both sense changes increased steeply from the asymptomatic group to the paucisymptomatic group to the symptomatic group Conclusion Sudden anosmia or ageusia needs to be recognized for early detection of COVID-19 infection to identify otherwise hidden carriers, thus favoring an early isolation strategy that will restrict the spread of the disease","output":"Prevalence of Anosmia or Ageusia in COVID-19 Patients Among UAE Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate the cardiometabolic effects of a home-based lifestyle intervention (LI) in breast cancer survivors (BCSs) during the COVID-19 lockdown.

In the next section, we discuss philosophy as a way of life (PWL) as an alternative nascent field in academic philosophy that, while garnering respect and recognition within the academy, has regained connections with a broader public desperate for ways to chart their own paths of meaningful living, especially when facing a deeply challenged and fractured world. PWL helps address the crises of meaning many in the academy face (both teachers and students) and the absence of rich philosophical reflection and communities in the broader public, which otherwise all too easily fall prey to hucksters, con-artists, and authoritarian and conspiratorial forces. We argue that this kind of wholistic critical development of PWL from the ancient world is designed to enact a prefigurative or eutopian politics.

Despite its increasing acceptance, the clinical benefits of transanal minimally invasive surgery have not yet been validated. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to assess the adequacy of transanal minimally invasive surgery for the local excision of benign and malignant lesions of the rectum. DESIGN This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent transanal minimally invasive surgery for local excision of neoplasms at a single institution. SETTINGS The study was conducted by a single group of colorectal surgeons at a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS Eligible patients with early-stage rectal cancer and benign neoplasms were offered transanal minimally invasive surgery as a means for local excision. Data from these patients were collected prospectively in a registry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measures included the feasibility of transanal minimally invasive surgery for local excision, resection quality, and short-term clinical results. RESULTS : Fifty patients underwent transanal minimally invasive surgery between July 2009 and December 2011. Twenty-five benign neoplasms, 23 malignant lesions, and 2 neuroendocrine tumors were excised. All lesions were excised using transanal minimally invasive surgery without conversion to an alternate transanal platform. The average length of stay was 0.6 days (range, 0-6), and 68% of patients were discharged on the day of surgery. The average distance from the anal verge was 8.1 cm (range, 3-14 cm). All lesions were excised completely with only 2 fragmented specimens (4%). All specimens were removed with grossly negative margins, although 3 (6%) were found to have microscopically positive margins on final pathology. There were 2 recurrences (4%) at 6- and 18-month follow-up. Early complications occurred in 3 patients (6%). No long-term complications were observed at a median follow-up of 20 months. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by its retrospective nature and midterm follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Transanal minimally invasive surgery is an advanced transanal platform that provides a safe and effective method for resecting benign neoplasms, as well as carefully selected, early-stage malignancies of the mid and distal rectum.","output":"Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) for local excision of benign neoplasms and early-stage rectal cancer: efficacy and outcomes in the first 50 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immigrants in Japan face multiple health care challenges. There is limited research addressing how all-cause mortality differs between foreign residents and Japanese citizens, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed whether all-cause mortality rates between Japanese citizens and foreign residents living in Japan differ, and whether these differentials changed after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using vital statistical data of all deaths among citizens and foreign residents that occurred within Japanese borders aggregated every 6 months between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2021. Data were used to calculate sex-, region-, and 20-year age group-specific standardized mortality rates using the direct method based on the population distribution of Japanese citizens in 2021 by sex, region, and 20-year age groups. Chi-squared tests and linear regression were used to assess whether the pandemic was associated with changes in mortality rates among groups and changes in the mortality differentials between citizens and non-citizens, respectively. All-cause mortality increased monotonically with age for men and women. Men had higher mortality than women, regardless of age or nationality. All-cause mortality is lower among immigrants than Japanese citizens between the ages of 20C59, but higher under the age of 20 and over the age of 59. The pandemic was associated with significant changes in mortality in most groups, but no statistically significant changes in the mortality differentials between immigrants and Japanese citizens were detected. Young immigrants are generally healthier than their Japanese counterparts, in line with the healthy migrant hypothesis. Younger migrants are at higher risk of mortality, possibly due to increased vulnerability to psychologic stress. Older migrant mortality converged with citizen mortality, consistent with acculturation that occurs with longer duration of residence. The pandemic did not exacerbate health inequities for foreign residents with respect to mortality.","output":"Pre- and post-COVID-19 all-cause mortality of Japanese citizens versus foreign residents living in Japan, 2015C2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the likelihood that hospital staff will report symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress has increased.

RESULTS: Among 10,448 COVID-19 patients, ARBs and ACEIs were prescribed in 1,231 (11.7%) and 57 (0.6%) patients, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and history of comorbidities, the ARB group showed neutral association (HR, 1.034; 95% CI, 0.765 to 1.399; p = 0.8270) and the ACEI groups showed no significant associations likely owing to the small population size (HR, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.314 to 1.726; p = 0.4810). When comparing HR between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia in 2019, the trend of ACEIs showed similar benefits, whereas the protective effect of ARBs observed in the retrospective cohort was absent in COVID-19 patients.

Our aims were to re-evaluate vitamin D testing and supplementation among inpatients with IDD, examine any correlates with physical health conditions including COVID-19 and make recommendations for the current regime of supplementation and testing within inpatient IDD services. Method The study population comprised inpatients who were in any of the Northgate Hospital IDD inpatient services in Northumberland, UK. The wards sampled were the Medium Secure Unit, Low Secure Unit, Hospital Based Rehabilitation Wards and Specialist Autism Inpatient Service. Records of all inpatients between January 2019 and July 2020 were examined for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level, ward area, supplementation status, test seasonality, medication, and health status. We performed a correlation to see whether there was an association between vitamin D level and length of time on treatment. In addition, comparison of the replete and inadequate group for age, ethnicity, seasonality, ward location and psychotropic medication was undertaken. Data on physical health risk factors, obesity and COVID-19 infection were also collected. The physical comorbidities were described in order to evaluate whether any emerging patterns relating to COVID-19 infection were emerging. Result There were 67 inpatients in Northgate IDD services on 1 January 2019, with 11 further patients admitted up to the end of the sampling period on 31 July 2020. Nineteen patients were discharged during that period, so the sample comprised 78 patients. Ages were comparable across three of the ward areas, except for an older group of patients in the hospital-based rehabilitation setting. Mean 25(OH)D level for supplemented (800IU/day) patients was 75nmol/l (SD 20) compared to 40nmol/l (SD 19) in the non-supplemented group (p < 0.001). Thirty-eight percent of those who were inpatients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic developed symptoms, but the small sample size could not establish vitamin D levels as a predictor of outcome. Conclusion Our findings show that clinicians continue to offer vitamin D supplementation for inpatients, at a dose of 800IU (20g) per day. The mean vitamin D levels we observed were higher for those on supplements compared to our 2013 baseline data, whereas patients not on supplementation now had levels akin to those found previously. Vitamin D (800IU/day) supplementation is effective but adequacy of the nationally recommended dose of 400IU/day is unclear.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)-mediated tumorigenesis and provide a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting the EBV DNA genome. We found that LMP1 upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR) coactivator-1 (PGC1) through activation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B). Furthermore, the activated PGC1 upregulated the expression of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) through the coactivation of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and GA-binding protein  (GABP), preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated base incision in the EBV genome and favoring its survival. Interruption of hexokinase domain component 1 (HKDC1) by either shRNA or Tf-D-HKC8 peptide suppressed the interaction of HKDC1 with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), triggering mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive generation of ROS, thus resulting in EBV suppression through ROS-mediated DNA damage. Suppression of the EBV genome inhibited the expression of the LMP1/PGC1/HKDC1/OGG1 signaling pathway, forming a positive feed forward loop for the generation of ROS, hence inhibiting the EBV genome and subsequent EBV-associated tumor development. We concluded that LMP1 triggers EBV-associated tumorigenesis through activation of the PGC1 pathway.

The regulated pathway could not be restored by transfecting with DNA encoding trypsinogen, a soluble regulated secretory protein targeted to secretory granules. A comparison of secretion from variant and wild type cells allows a distinction to be made between constitutive secretion and basal secretion, the spontaneous release of regulated proteins that occurs in the absence of stimulation.","output":"Constitutive and basal secretion from the endocrine cell line, AtT-20"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Home care aides are a rapidly growing, non-standard workforce who face numerous health risks and stressors on the job. While research shows that aides receive limited support from their agency employers, few studies have explored the wider range of support that aides use when navigating work stress and considered the implications of these arrangements. To investigate this question, we conducted 47 in-depth interviews with 29 home care aides in New York City, focused specifically on aides use of support after client death. Theories of work stress, the social ecological framework, and feminist theories of care informed our research. Our analysis demonstrates aides extensive reliance on personal sources of support and explores the challenges this can create in their lives and work, and, potentially, for their communities. We also document aides efforts to cultivate support stemming from their home-based work environments. Home care aides work stress thus emerges as both an occupational health and a community health issue. While employers should carry responsibility for preventing and mitigating work stress, moving toward health equity for marginalized careworkers requires investing in policy-level and community-level supports to bolster employer efforts, particularly as the home care industry becomes increasingly fragmented and non-standard.","output":"Expanding the Conceptualization of Support in Low-Wage Carework: The Case of Home Care Aides and Client Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most COVID-19-associated hospitalizations occur in older adults, but severe disease that requires hospitalization occurs in all age groups, including adolescents aged 12-17 years (1). On May 10, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the Emergency Use Authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include persons aged 12-15 years, and CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended it for this age group on May 12, 2021.* Before that time, COVID-19 vaccines had been available only to persons aged 16 years. Understanding and describing the epidemiology of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in adolescents and comparing it with adolescent hospitalizations associated with other vaccine-preventable respiratory viruses, such as influenza, offers evidence of the benefits of expanding the recommended age range for vaccination and provides a baseline and context from which to assess vaccination impact. Using the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), CDC examined COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among adolescents aged 12-17 years, including demographic and clinical characteristics of adolescents admitted during January 1-March 31, 2021, and hospitalization rates (hospitalizations per 100,000 persons) among adolescents during March 1, 2020-April 24, 2021. Among 204 adolescents who were likely hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 during January 1-March 31, 2021, 31.4% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 4.9% required invasive mechanical ventilation; there were no associated deaths. During March 1, 2020-April 24, 2021, weekly adolescent hospitalization rates peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January 2021, declined to 0.6 in mid-March, and then rose to 1.3 in April.

PROs are self-reports of patients health status without interpretation by anyone else. The tools developed to assess PROs are known as patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs). The technological innovations that have led to an increased ownership of electronic devices have also facilitated the development of electronic PROMs (ePROMs). ePROMs are a conduit for telemedicine in the care of patients with chronic diseases. Various studies have demonstrated that the use of ePROMs in routine clinical practice is both acceptable and feasible with patients increasingly expressing a preference for an electronic mode of administration. There is increasing evidence that the use of electronic patient-reported outcome (ePROMs) could have significant impacts on outcomes valued by patients, healthcare providers and researchers. Whilst the development and implementation of these systems may be initially costly and resource-intensive, patient preferences and existing evidence to support their implementation suggests the need for continued research prioritisation in this area.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on primary PCI for STEMI. Between March 2019 and March 2021, 259 patients with STEMI underwent primary PCI. Patients were divided into 2 groups: the pre-pandemic group (March 2019-February 2020) and the pandemic group (March 2020-February 2021). The patient demographics, reperfusion time including onset-to-door time, door-to-balloon time (DTBT), computed tomography (CT), peak creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and 30-day mortality rate were investigated. The mean age of the patients was 70.4  12.9 years, and 71.6% were male. There were 117 patients before the pandemic and 142 during the pandemic. The median DTBT was 29 (21.25-41.25) minutes before the pandemic and 48 minutes (31-73 minutes) during the pandemic (P < 0.001).

CMV leverages capillary evaporation to enable rapid desiccation of aqueous solutions while avoiding both freezing and boiling. In the CMV process, an aqueous solution containing the biological material of interest and common excipients is applied to a solid, porous support, referred to as the scaffold, and desiccated under vacuum. The pores within the scaffold accelerate drying by increasing surface area while preventing boiling through the interaction of the vapor pressure, capillary forces, and viscous forces. The process, which can be completed in under an hour, produces an amorphous dried product with enhanced thermal stability. In this study, CMV is demonstrated using luciferase as a model system. Using a 30-minute drying time, residual moisture levels of <4% were achieved. CMV-stabilized luciferase maintained full activity when stored for up to 6 weeks at 25C and >70% activity after 6 weeks at temperatures up to 45C.

Polysomnography data showed that LJF increased the time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the day under basal conditions. Furthermore, latency to sleep was reduced and the time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was increased during recovery from acute sleep deprivation. Furthermore, LJF-treated mice showed increased REM sleep and altered electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum in response to intra-peritoneal injection of LPS. LJF significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-, and IL-1 in the blood serum as well as hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) tissues in the LPS-challenged mice by inhibiting microglial activation. Moreover, LJF increased the time spent in REM sleep in the LPS-challenged mice compared to the control mice.

METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 31 patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (20 with carcinoid tumors and 11 with other tumors) treated with (131)I-MIBG. Treatment outcome was analyzed for patients with carcinoid tumors (the most common tumors in this study), and toxicity was analyzed for the entire patient cohort (n = 31). Treatment comprised 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per course and minimum intervals of 3 mo. The radiographic response was classified according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Toxicity was determined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) for all laboratory data at regular follow-up visits and during outpatient care, including complete blood counts and hepatic and renal function tests. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier curve method (log rank test; P < 0.05). RESULTS The radiographic responses in patients with carcinoid tumors comprised a minor response in 2 patients (10%), stable disease in 16 patients (80%; median time to progression, 34 mo), and progressive disease in 2 patients (10%). The symptomatic responses in patients with functioning carcinoid tumors comprised complete resolution in 3 of the 11 evaluable symptomatic patients (27%), partial resolution in 6 patients (55%), and no significant change in 11 patients. The median overall survival in patients with carcinoid tumors was 47 mo (95% confidence interval, 32-62), and the median progression-free survival was 34 mo (95% confidence interval, 13-55). Relevant treatment toxicities were confined to transient myelosuppression of grade 3 or 4 in 15.3% (leukopenia) and 7.6% (thrombocytopenia) of applied cycles and a suspected late adverse event (3% of patients), myelodysplastic syndrome, after a cumulative administered activity of 66.6 GBq. The most frequent nonhematologic side effect was mild nausea (grade 1 or 2), which was observed in 28% of administered cycles. No hepatic or renal toxicities were noted. CONCLUSION Dose-intensified treatment with (131)I-MIBG at a fixed dose of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per cycle is safe and offers effective palliation of symptoms and disease stabilization in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors.

METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched using appropriate keywords till June 8, 2021, to identify observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting adverse clinical outcomes (ICU admission and/or mortality) in COVID-19 patients receiving vitamin D supplementation vs. those not receiving the same. Both prior use and use of vitamin D after COVID-19 diagnosis were considered. Unadjusted/adjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated (PROSPERO registration number CRD42021248488). RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (10 observational, 3 RCTs) pooling data retrieved from 2933 COVID-19 patients. Pooled analysis of unadjusted data showed that vitamin D use in COVID-19 was significantly associated with reduced ICU admission/mortality (OR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.81, p = 0.01, I(2) = 66%, random-effects model). Similarly, on pooling adjusted risk estimates, vitamin D was also found to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes (pooled OR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.91, p = 0.03, I(2) = 80%, random-effects model).

In some countries, construction projects are discontinued, and even in some countries where construction work is still permitted, high safety standards are required. Construction site safety is essential during the COVID-19 pandemic. The contractor is responsible for creating a safe workplace at the project site. Therefore, this paper presents project risk identification and mitigation during the covid-19 pandemic based on contractor's perspective. This research identified the risk factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that consist of 5 categories: man, materials, machines, methods, and environment. Between these risk factors, worker shortage, site accessibility, and lack of construction materials, caused by the strict large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) policy are the biggest challenges faced by the contractor. The findings of this research develop the project risk categories and mitigation strategies from the contractor's perspective. It suggests that future construction in addition to planning the design, operate, maintenance, supply chain, and project management must also consider the occurrence of a pandemic. ?

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of physical activity (PA) of Czech children during COVID-19 in autumn 2020. METHODS: Ninety-eight Czech children (mean age = 10.1  1.47 years) completed the standardized Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Czech Children (PAQ-C/cz) during COVID lockdown. Data were compared with previously published norms. Thirty-five children also reported daily number of steps measured by accelerometers. RESULTS: Total PAQ-C score was 0.38 lower during COVID compared to Pre-COVID [t(302) = 5.118., p < .001]. The male PAQ-C total score was 0.37 lower [t(146) = 3.21., p = .002)] and the female total score was 0.39 lower [t(154) = 3.97., p < .001] during COVID compared to Pre-COVID. Specifically, responses of PA during spare time, before-school, physical education (PE), and recess were significantly lower during COVID. The average number of steps was 7.767 steps/day (boys = 9.255; girls = 6.982). CONCLUSION: COVID lockdown resulted in significant reduction of PA in Czech children.

To understand the evolution of these symptoms during the course of the disease is important to identify patients with persistent loss of smell or taste and estimate the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the burden of olfactory and gustative dysfunctions. Objective: To evaluate the evolution of the loss of sense of smell and taste in a case series of mildly symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey-based study included 202 mildly symptomatic adults (&#8805;18 years) consecutively assessed at Treviso Regional Hospital, Italy, between March 19 and March 22, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of altered sense of smell and taste at follow-up and their variation from baseline. Results: Of 202 patients completing the survey at baseline, 187 (92.6%) also completed the follow-up survey (103 [55.1%] women; median age, 56 years). The evaluation of the evolution of altered sense of smell or taste in the 113 patients reporting sudden onset of these symptoms at baseline showed that 55 patients (48.7%; 95% CI, 39.2-58.3) reported complete resolution of smell or taste impairment, 46 (40.7%; 95% CI, 31.6-50.4) reported an improvement in the severity, and only 12 (10.6%; 95% CI, 5.6-17.8) reported the symptom was unchanged or worse.

METHODS: We performed a questionnaire study over a period of 4 weeks following the COVID-19 lockdown at our academic neurosurgical department. A 15-item questionnaire was distributed to the patients with 3 additional questions to be answered by the treating neurosurgeon. RESULTS: A total of 437 questionnaires were analyzed. Overall anxiety to visit a general practitioner or the outpatient facility within the hospital was very low among patients. A quarter of all appointments had to be postponed due to COVID-19, in 0.6% postponement was perceived as incorrect by the treating neurosurgeon. We noted that 43% did not get an appointment due to the restrictions, 20% did not want to bother the medical system, and only 4% were afraid to get infected in the hospital.

To date, relatively few studies have been investigated on the effects of portable chest radiography through glass barrier. Objectives: Our goal was to evaluate exposure technique and radiation dose between conventional and through glass portable chest computed radiography. Materials and methods: Experiments using an anthropomorphic phantom were performed for acquired portable chest PA radiography at SID 180 cm with glass door being open and closed. The EI and DI values were optimized to provide the appropriate exposure technique for glass barrier. Entrance surface air kerma and scatter survey were made to assess the radiation dose both inside and outside the room. Finally, HVL measurement of primary X-ray beam and after transmission through glass were determined. Results: Based on the fixed kVp and mAs technique, the EI value with glass barrier was less than the EI without the glass. Imaging through glass barrier showed the average EI reduction of 10.4% for Carestream and 37% for Konica. The average entrance surface air kerma reduction was 56.6% over a range of 90-120 kVp. The appropriate exposure technique for conventional portable chest PA using computed radiography was 100 kVp 2.5 mAs. With the same kVp setting, doubling the mAs is required for imaging through glass barrier to produce good diagnostic image quality (100 kVp and 4.0 mAs). The acceptable EI and DI ranges for CR used were EI=1742, DI=-0.02 (without glass) and EI=1795, DI=0.11 (with glass) for Carestream and EI=352, DI=-0.03 (without glass) and EI=373, DI=0.22 (with glass) for Konica respectively. The primary beam after transmission through the glass thickness 5 mm was 36%. The measured scatter of inside room compared to outside was very low at 1-2 meters. Increasing od HVL from 3.9 to 6.1 mm Al indicates the effect of beam hardening by glass. Conclusion: These experiments confirmed that through glass portable chest computed radiography are feasible and safe.

Using the mitochondrial tandem protein Arg5,6 as a model substrate, we demonstrate that MPP has an additional role in preprotein maturation, beyond the removal of presequences. Arg5,6 is synthesized as a polyprotein precursor that is imported into mitochondria and subsequently separated into two distinct enzymes. This internal processing is performed by MPP, which cleaves the Arg5,6 precursor at its N-terminus and at an internal site. The peculiar organization of Arg5,6 is conserved across fungi and reflects the polycistronic arginine operon in prokaryotes. MPP cleavage sites are also present in other mitochondrial fusion proteins from fungi, plants, and animals.

There are currently no FDA-approved antiviral drugs for COVID-19 and there is an urgent need to develop treatment strategies that can effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous approaches have been researched so far, with one of them being the emerging exosome-based therapies. Exosomes are nano-sized, lipid bilayer-enclosed structures, share structural similarities with viruses secreted from all types of cells, including those lining the respiratory tract. Importantly, the interplay between exosomes and viruses could be potentially exploited for antiviral drug and vaccine development. Exosomes are produced by virus-infected cells and play crucial roles in mediating communication between infected and uninfected cells. SARS-CoV-2 modulates the production and composition of exosomes, and can exploit exosome formation, secretion, and release pathways to promote infection, transmission, and intercellular spread. Exosomes have been exploited for therapeutic benefits in patients afflicted with various diseases including COVID-19. Furthermore, the administration of exosomes loaded with immunomodulatory cargo in combination with antiviral drugs represents a novel intervention for the treatment of diseases such as COVID-19. In particular, exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are used as cell-free therapeutic agents. Mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes reduces the cytokine storm and reverse the inhibition of host anti-viral defenses associated with COVID-19 and also enhances mitochondrial function repair lung injuries.

Methods and ResultsThis is an observational study generated from the first 79 patients admitted to intensive care in Uppsala due to respiratory failure with SARS-CoV-2 infection, during the first wave in 2020, included in the PRONMED study. From this group 34 underwent echocardiographic examination of which 25 were included in the study, and compared to 44 non-echo patients. Demographic analysis compared standard parameters and previous morbidities between the echo and non-echo group. Standard echocardiographic parameters were analysed indicating a reduced left ventricular function as assessed by global longitudinal strain and very discrete increases in wall thickness in the group as a whole. A group comparison between the outcomes survival and death was carried out. Right sided dimensions and functional parameters did not indicate major strain. An increased maximum tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicating increased pulmonary arterial pressure was significantly associated with death, but failed to maintain significance when corrected for multiple comparison. Biochemical cardiac markers and D-dimer correlated to initiation of echocardiography and mortality. Tricuspid regurgitation maximum velocity was positively correlated with maximum troponin I. ConclusionThese results suggests that there is no clear negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are indications that pulmonary pressure elevation carries a negative predictive outcome suggesting pulmonary disease as the major driver of mortality.

Our debiased panel data regression analysis with a set of county dummies, interactions of state and week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We also find that the positive association of K-12 school visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools.

Signifying a move to mainstreaming internationalization within the overall quality of domestic higher education, IaH was once popular but somehow lost momentum. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where outbound mobility is severely impeded, Vietnam has become home to energetic discussions on IaH. This chapter spotlights the case of IaH in Vietnams higher education, demonstrating that it implies a whole different constellation of relations. While IaH in Vietnam invokes an existing more or less neocolonial network of relations shaped by mobilizing Western ideas and forms, discourses emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic have opened up opportunities to push the currently dominant configuration into multiple directions. Particularly, this chapter argues that IaH can be in line with place-based internationalization, theorized as a mode of internationalization characterized by commitments related to local/community engagement, student wellbeing, and care. While mobility-driven internationalization produces accelerated desire, place-based internationalization, generates realistic considerations and intimate relations. IaH could tap into the resources that have been created through different forms of mobility to enact its place-based mode.

There is an urgent need for a COVID-19 disease severity assessment that can assist in patient triage and resource allocation for patients at risk for severe disease. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and scale a clinical decision support system and mobile app to assist in COVID-19 severity assessment, management, and care. METHODS: Model training data from 701 patients with COVID-19 were collected across practices within the Family Health Centers network at New York University Langone Health. A two-tiered model was developed. Tier 1 uses easily available, nonlaboratory data to help determine whether biomarker-based testing and/or hospitalization is necessary. Tier 2 predicts the probability of mortality using biomarker measurements (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer) and age. Both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 models were validated using two external datasets from hospitals in Wuhan, China, comprising 160 and 375 patients, respectively. RESULTS: All biomarkers were measured at significantly higher levels in patients who died vs those who were not hospitalized or discharged (P<.001). The Tier 1 and Tier 2 internal validations had areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.98), respectively. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 external validations had AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the validity of the clinical decision support system and mobile app, which are now ready to assist health care providers in making evidence-based decisions when managing COVID-19 patient care.

Successful bacterial propagation in the gut is strongly associated with the adaptation to changing nutrition-caused environmental conditions; e.g. environmental salt stresses. Concentrations of 350 mM NaCl, the prevailing salinity in the colon, led to significantly reduced growth of C. difficile. Metabolomics of salt- stressed bacteria revealed a major reduction of the central energy generation pathways, including the Stickland-fermentation reactions. No obvious synthesis of compatible solutes was observed up to 24 h of growth. The ensuing limited tolerance to high salinity and absence of compatible solute synthesis might result from an evolutionary adaptation to the exclusive life of C. difficile in the mammalian gut. Addition of the compatible solutes carnitine, glycine-betaine, -butyrobetaine, crotonobetaine, homobetaine, proline-betaine and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) restored growth (choline and proline failed) under conditions of high salinity. A bioinformatically-identified OpuF-type ABC-transporter imported most of the used compatible solutes. A long-term adaptation after 48 h included a shift of the Stickland fermentation-based energy metabolism from the utilization to the accumulation of L-proline and resulted in restored growth. Surprisingly, salt stress resulted in the formation of coccoid C. difficile cells instead of the typical rod-shaped cells, a process reverted by the addition of several compatible solutes. Hence, compatible solute import via OpuF is the major immediate adaptation strategy of C. difficile to high salinity-incurred cellular stress. This article is protected by copyright.

AESI have not been adequately assessed following COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer contributing to vaccine hesitancy in this population. We aimed to evaluate the association between BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines and the risk of AESI in adults with active cancer or a history of cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a territory-wide cohort study using electronic health records managed by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority and vaccination records provided by the Department of Health. Patients with a cancer diagnosis between January 1, 2018, and September 30, 2021, were included and stratified into two cohorts: active cancer and history of cancer. Within each cohort, patients who received two doses of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac were 1:1 matched to unvaccinated patients using the propensity score. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for AESI 28 days after the second vaccine dose. RESULTS: A total of 74,878 patients with cancer were included (vaccinated: 25,789 [34%]; unvaccinated: 49,089 [66%]). Among patients with active cancer, the incidence of AESI was 0.31 and 1.02 per 10,000 person-days with BNT162b2 versus unvaccinated patients and 0.13 and 0.88 per 10,000 person-days with CoronaVac versus unvaccinated patients. Among patients with history of cancer, the incidence was 0.55 and 0.89 per 10,000 person-days with BNT162b2 versus unvaccinated patients and 0.42 and 0.93 per 10,000 person-days with CoronaVac versus unvaccinated patients. Neither vaccine was associated with a higher risk of AESI for patients with active cancer (BNT162b2: HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.08C1.09; CoronaVac: 0.14, 95% CI 0.02C1.18) or patients with history of cancer (BNT162b2: 0.62, 95% CI 0.30C1.28; CoronaVac: 0.45, 95% CI 0.21C1.00). CONCLUSIONS: In this territory-wide cohort study of patients with cancer, the incidence of AESI following vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or CoronaVac vaccines was low. The findings of this study can reassure clinicians and patients with cancer about the overall safety of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac in patients with cancer, which could increase the COVID-19 vaccination rate in this vulnerable group of patients.

Our aim was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of biological therapy in SEA in a real-life setting and to identify the predictors for switching to another biological drug in patients with poor asthma control. The outcomes for efficacy were decreased annual exacerbations (AE) and improved asthma control test (ACT). Methods: In 90 SEA patients being treated with a biological drug, clinical examination, ACT, blood eosinophils count and spirometry were assessed before (T0) and after 6 (T1), 12 (T2), 24 (T3) and 36 (T4) months from the start of biological therapy. Patients were considered responders (R) or non-responders (NR) to biologics depending on whether or not they had less than two AE and a 20% increase in the ACT after 12 months of treatment. Results: 75% of the patients were R, 25% NR. In R patients, biological therapy add-on was followed by significant improvement in AE and ACT throughout the whole follow-up period. The percentage of patients on oral corticosteroids (OCS) dropped from 40% to 12%. By contrast, the NR patients were shifted to another biological drug after 12 months of therapy, as they still had high AE and nearly unchanged ACT; 40% of them still needed OCS treatment. The predictors of switching to another biological drug were three or more AE, ACT below 17, nasal polyposis and former smoking (p < 0.05). In NR, the shift to another biological drug was followed by a significant decrease in AE and an increase in the ACT. Discussion: This real-life study confirms the long-term efficacy of biologics in most SEA patients and indicates that even in non-responders to a first biological drug, it is worth trying a second one. It is hoped that the availability of additional biologics with different targets will help improve the personalization of SEA therapy.","output":"Biologics in Severe Eosinophilic Asthma: Three-Year Follow-Up in a SANI Single Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low levels of parvovirus B19 (B19V) DNA can be detected in the circulation and in different tissue of immunocompetent individuals for months or years, which has been linked to inflammatory diseases such as cardiomyopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, and vasculitis.

This study aimed to evaluate the method based on the Benzonase(?) treatment for differentiation between the infectious virions from naked DNA in serum and bone marrow (BM) samples to be useful for the B19V routine diagnosis. In addition, we estimated the period of viremia and DNAemia in the sera and bone marrow of nonhuman primates experimentally infected with B19V. Serum samples from ten patients and from four cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with B19V followed up for 60 days were used. Most of the human serum samples became negative after pretreatment; however, only decreased viral DNA loads were observed in four patients, indicating that these samples still contained the infectious virus. Reduced B19V DNA levels were observed in animals since 7th dpi. At approximately 45th dpi, B19V DNA levels were below 10(5) IU/mL after Benzonase(?) pretreatment, which was not a consequence of active B19V replication. The test based on Benzonase(?) pretreatment enabled the discrimination of naked DNA from B19V DNA encapsidated in virions.

Design/methodology/approach: To develop the prediction models, this research utilizes multisource Internet data from TripAdvisor travel forum and Google Trends. Temporal factors, posts and comments, search queries index and previous tourist arrivals records are set as predictors. Four sets of predictors and three distinct data compositions were utilized for training the machine learning models, namely artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF). To evaluate the models, this research uses three accuracy metrics, namely root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Findings: Prediction models trained using multisource Internet data predictors have better accuracy than those trained using single-source Internet data or other predictors. In addition, using more training sets that cover the phenomenon of interest, such as COVID-19, will enhance the prediction model's learning process and accuracy. The experiments show that the RF models have better prediction accuracy than the ANN and SVR models.

Obesity increases risk of infections and cancer, suggesting adverse effects on immune surveillance. Here, we report that obesity compromises the mechanisms regulating T-cell generation by inducing premature thymic involution. Diet-induced obesity reduced thymocyte counts and significantly increased apoptosis of developing T-cell populations. Obesity accelerated the age-related reduction of T-cell receptor (TCR) excision circle bearing peripheral lymphocytes, an index of recently generated T cells from thymus. Consistent with reduced thymopoiesis, dietary obesity led to reduction in peripheral naive T cells with increased frequency of effector-memory cells. Defects in thymopoiesis in obese mice were related with decrease in the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (Lin-Sca1+Kit+ Flt3+) as well as common lymphoid progenitor (Lin-Sca1+CD117(lo)CD127+) pools. The TCR spectratyping analysis showed that obesity compromised V-beta TCR repertoire diversity. Furthermore, the obesity induced by melanocortin 4 receptor deficiency also constricted the T-cell repertoire diversity, recapitulating the thymic defects observed with diet-induced obesity. In middle-aged humans, progressive adiposity with or without type 2 diabetes also compromised thymic output.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 210 government servants from four states (Selangor, Sabah, Kuala Lumpur, and Johor) from May 2021 to June 2021. Three validated questionnaires were used, namely, Emotional-Eater Questionnaire (EEQ), and Malay International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-M) from Lpez-Moreno et al. (1). RESULTS: There were significant gender differences (P < 0.001) for supplement intake, with 30.4% among men and 62.3% in women. Almost half (49.1%) were classified as emotional or very emotional eaters. Also, a significant difference (P < 0.005) was found in the perception of boredom and apathy between men (35.7%) and women (31.8%). A majority (56.2%) stated that their mood positively affected their eating habits. The total metabolic equivalent of task (MET) for 132 subjects was 3495.8  3862.7 min/week for physical activity.

Based on analysis of the PubMed database, it is shown that the attention to psychological and social factors is 74% higher in COVID-19-related articles compared to all other health-related scientific articles published during the same time-period (between 1/1/2020 and 4/18/2021). Specifically, 18.6% of the &#8776;123,500 articles addressing COVID-19-related topics also included psychological or social factors in their content vs. 10.7% of articles that did not address COVID-19. The biopsychosocial model is relevant to understanding the interrelationships among risk factors and the multidimensional clinical and psychosocial COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical outcomes directly related to COVID-19 range from severe but rare events (mortality and intensive care treatment) to less severe common outcomes such as positive screening tests for COVID-19 with or without symptoms. In addition, psychosocial outcomes range in severity from frequently observed reduced psychological wellbeing to less common clinical mood and anxiety disorders and, in rare cases, suicidality.

In this study, we sought to validate the recent positive findings from the randomised clinical trial RECOVERY and to evaluate the challenges in the analysis and interpretation of non-randomized comparative effectiveness studies in Covid-19. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study using an openly available database of hospitalised Covid-19 patients in Spain. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality at 28 days. We used multivariable Fine and Gray competing risk models which adjusted for both fixed and time-variant confounders to investigate the effect of TCZ on the primary outcome. RESULTS We analysed 2547 patients hospitalised with Covid-19 between 1st January and 28th June 2020. Patients in the TCZ group tended to have more severe Covid-19 at admission, as measured by biomarkers of disease severity including CRP, D-dimer and LDH. At 28 days, 91 out of 440 TCZ patients had died compared to 267 out of 2107 patients in the control group. In multivariable analysis, there was no evidence of an association between TCZ and the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio 1.20, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.64, P=0.26).

Clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographic (ECG) records were collected at admission. Patients were followed-up and in-hospital mortality constituted the primary endpoint. A risk scoring system to predict prognosis was derived by independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.Findings: A total of 1014 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Demographic, clinical, laboratories and ECG characteristics were collected. Median age was 74 (IQR 64-82) years, and most patients were male (61%). During a median follow-up of 12 (IQR 7-22) days, 359 (35%) patients died. Age (HR 2.25, 95%CIs 1.72-2.94, p < 0.001), delirium (HR 2.03, 95%CIs 2.14-3.61, p = 0.012), platelets count (HR 0.91, 95%CIs 0.83-0.98, p = 0.018), D-dimer (HR 1.18, 95%CIs 1.01-1.31, p = 0.002), S1Q3T3 pattern and/or RBBB (HR 1.47, 95%CIs 1.02-2.13, p = 0.039) and ECG signs of previous myocardial necrosis (HR 2.28, 95%CIs 1.23-4.21, p = 0.009) were independently associated to in-hospital mortality. The risk scoring system derived had a moderate discriminatory capability and good calibration. A score value 4 had a sensitivity of 78,4% and specificity of 65,2% to predict in-hospital mortality.Interpretation: This score system stratifies prognosis and may be important for the management of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04367129).Funding Statement: None.Declaration of Interests: None declared.Ethics Approval Statement: ELCOVID is a prospective observational study approved by the local Ethics Committee and involves 15 hospitals in the Emilia Romagna and Lazio, two regions in northern and central Italy heavily affected by the pandemic.","output":"A Simple Multiparametric Score System to Predict In-Hospital Mortality of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colonic leiomyomas are rare.

However, MWA carries relatively higher rates of residual disease compared to resection. Likelihood of MWA success is multifactorial and newer devices with more reliable ablation zones are being developed to overcome these drawbacks. This manuscript is a review of our first 100 liver ablations with the newer single antenna high powered MWA system. Materials and Methods Retrospective chart review of patients that underwent MWA for either primary or secondary hepatic malignancies between March 2015 and July 2016 was conducted. The complete ablation rates, rate of new lesions, complications, and short-term survival were analyzed. Multiple statistical tests, including multivariate regression, were used to assess risk factors for local residual and recurrent disease. Results Fifty-three patients (median age 61  9 years, 39 males) underwent 100 MWAs. Of the 100 lesions ablated, 76 were hepatocellular cancers (HCCs) and 24 were metastases. Median lesion size was 16  9 mm. Seventy- five of these patients had multifocal disease targeted in the same session. Seventy patients had cirrhosis (median model for end-stage liver disease score 9  3; Child-Pugh B and C in 42%). An 83% complete lesion ablation rate was seen on follow-up imaging with liver protocol magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (median follow-up of 1 year). The minor complication rate was 9.4% with no major complications or 30-day mortality. Despite this, evidence of new foci of hepatic disease was found in 47% of patients, the majority (80%) of which were in HCC patients (P < 0.01) and most of these new lesions were in a different hepatic segment (64%). Degree of cirrhosis (P < 0.01), presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (P = 0.01) and lesion's subcapsular location (P = 0.03) was significant predictors of residual disease. With the subset analysis of only HCC lesions larger than 1 cm, only the presence of NASH remained significant. Conclusion The single probe high power MWA of malignant hepatic lesions is safe and effective with minimal morbidity. Degree of cirrhosis, NASH, and subcapsular location was associated with an increased rate of residual disease on short-term follow-up.","output":"Early Outcomes with Single-antenna High-powered Percutaneous Microwave Ablation for Primary and Secondary Hepatic Malignancies: Safety, Effectiveness, and Predictors of Ablative Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The letter comments on a recent commentary published in Liver International entitled \\"COVID-19 and liver disease\\" by Sun et al., and describes a pooled analysis of data on bilirubin levels in patients with and without severe Covid-19.

Binding affinities of HLA molecules and viral peptides were assessed with accurate in silico methods. The obtained results highlight the importance of taking HLA alleles diversity into account: mutation-mediated alterations in HLA-peptide interactions were highly dependent on HLA alleles. For example, we found that the essential number of peptides tightly bound to HLA-B*07:02 in the reference Wuhan variant ceased to be tight binders for the Indian (Delta) and the UK (Alpha) variants.

Institutions of higher education do use technology in various ways, however, successful incorporation of ICT in education requires acceptance by instructors who are expected to use ICT in teaching practices. Although international findings reveal that ICT should be used in nursing education, some faculty members experience difficulty integrating it. METHOD A mixed methodological research approach was used to investigate the attitudes of nursing teaching staff toward the use of ICT in nursing education. RESULTS Our findings revealed three categories of faculty with differing attitudes to the use of ICT in teaching and learning: pioneers, faculty members who have developed positive attitudes toward ICT usage; followers, faculty members with neutral attitudes; and resisters, faculty members with negative attitudes.

Methods: We quantified all-cause excess mortality in India, comparing deaths during the peak of the first and second COVID waves (Jul-Dec 2020 and April-June 2021) with month wise deaths in 2015-19 from three sources: Civil Registration System (CRS) mortality reports from 15 states or cities with 37% of India's population; deaths in 0.2 million health facilities; and a representative survey of 0.14 million adults about COVID deaths. Results: During the first viral wave, the median excess mortality compared to CRS baseline was 22% and 41%, respectively, in included states and cities, rising to 46% and 85% during the second wave. In settings with 10 or more months of data across the two waves, the median excess mortality was 32% and 37% for states and cities, respectively. Deaths in health facilities showed a 27% excess mortality from July 2020-May 2021, reaching 120% during April-May 2021. The national survey found 3.5% of adults reported a COVID death in their household in April-June 2021, approximately doubling the 3.2% expected overall deaths. The national survey showed 29-32% excess deaths from June 1, 2020 to June 27, 2021, most of which were likely to be COVID. This translates to 3.1-3.4 million COVID deaths (including 2.5-2.8 million during April-June 2021).

Despite numerous preliminary results, there is as yet no treatment of proven efficacy for this condition. In this context, the pharmacological properties of lithium, better known as a treatment for mood disorders, merit closer examination. Lithium has shown in vitro efficacy at inhibiting the replication of coronaviruses responsible for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in animals. It has immunomodulatory properties that may be of additional benefit in moderating the host inflammatory response to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, there is evidence that lithium may exert a protective action against upper respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses in patients taking it for other indications. These promising reports must be balanced against the narrow therapeutic index and high risk of toxicity associated with lithium therapy, its documented interactions with several commonly used drugs, and the absence of evidence of its efficacy against coronaviruses responsible for human disease. Nevertheless, naturalistic studies of the risk of COVID-19 in patients already receiving lithium could provide indirect evidence of its efficacy, and understanding the putative antiviral and immune-regulatory mechanisms of lithium in models of SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide leads for the development of safer and more effective treatments with a specific action against COVID-19.","output":"Lithium as a candidate treatment for COVID-19: Promises and pitfalls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) such as deep learning in the quality control of grains has the potential to assist analysts in decision making and improving procedures.

The prevalence of CPV was 58 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 52 to 63 per cent), with some evidence for regional variation. The prevalence of CECoV was 7.9 per cent (95 per cent CI 5.1 to 10.7 per cent). Analysis showed that animals with no history of vaccination were more likely to be CPV positive, with greatest effect in younger animals. CPV-positive animals were more likely to present with depression/lethargy than CPV-negative cases. The volume of diarrhoea and the presence of haemorrhage did not appear to be associated with the likelihood of detecting CPV.

METHODS: Students completed an online questionnaire that included the Brief Resilience Scale at their matriculation in August 2019. Survey results were linked to demographic information collected by all schools. A follow-up survey in May 2020 included original questions on COVID-19 stressors and news monitoring. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: Across schools, 74% (266/360) provided consent for the 2019 survey, and 76% (201/264) responded to COVID-19 questions in the follow-up 2020 survey. Students were extremely or very concerned about family members getting infected (n = 71, 76% School of Medicine (SOM); n = 31, 76% School of Nursing (SON); n = 50, 75% School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM)) and curriculum schedule changes (n = 72, 78%, SOM; n = 28, 68% SON; n = 52, 79% SVM).

In this descriptive, phenomenological study, interview data collected from 30 nurses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Physical and emotional trauma experienced during the early and peak months of the pandemic led nurses to evaluate their current work arrangements and to ponder alternatives. Our results suggest that pandemic work environments contributed to a change in nursing workforce distribution and exacerbated widening nurse shortage gaps. A call to action bids leaders to institute retention measures based on factors influencing nurses' career trajectory decisions in the current environment. Our findings led to recommendations for leadership approaches to promote nurses' emotional healing and mental wellness.","output":"Lived Travel Nurse and Permanent Staff Nurse Pandemic Work Experiences as Influencers of Motivation, Happiness, Stress, and Career Decisions: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autologous priming (AP) of the extracorporeal circuit has been used as a technique to reduce iatrogenic anemia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The purpose of this study was to review the results of standardizing AP techniques to reduce variation among clinicians and its effect on clinical outcomes. Standardized goal-directed protocols for AP were established by the cardiac team and applied to all adult cardiac surgical patients where CPB was used. Following Institutional Review Board approval, data were analyzed for two sequential groups of patients: Non-standardized AP (NST-AP) and standardized AP (ST-AP). Exclusion criteria included pre-CPB hemodynamic instability and preoperative hematocrit (Hct) values less than 30%. The primary end point was the transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas secondary end points included Hct change and other perioperative allogeneic blood product transfusions. Data are presented as mean and SD. Of the 192 patients evaluated, 82 were in the NST-AP group and 110 in the ST-AP group. There were no preoperative demographic differences across groups. Total AP volume was lower in the NST-AP group than in the ST-AP patients (486.8  259.6 mL vs. 1,048.2  218.7 mL, p < .001). Whereas pre-CPB Hct values were identical between the groups, the first on-CPB (25.7%  4.5% vs. 27.9%  4.2%, p < .001), high CPB (27.7%  3.5% vs. 29.1%  3.6%, p < .008), and first postoperative (32.5%  4.0% vs. 34.3%  3.9%, p < .003) were all significantly higher in ST-AP patients. Perioperative transfusion rate was higher in NST-AP patients (63.6%) vs. ST-AP (44.6%), p < .01. There was no difference in intraoperative RBC transfusion, but postoperatively, more patients in the NST-AP group received RBCs than those in the ST-AP group (51.2% vs. 28.2%, p < .01). The application of an ST-AP protocol was effective in reducing hemodilution, which was associated within higher Hcts and lower postoperative transfusion rates.","output":"The Effect of Standardizing Autologous Prime Techniques in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery with Cardiopulmonary Bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on forest product markets and the forest product industry, and has also seriously affected the sales of forest products.

Here, we designed a unique posture of rose Bengal (RB) on cotton-based super-adsorptive fibrous equipment, with RB being separately captured in the mesopores of porous organic polymers (POPs). The resultant daylight-induced biocidal cotton fabric with enhanced efficiency was named as DBwEE-Cotton. The enhanced biocidal activity of the DBwEE-Cotton was achieved based on two mechanisms: (1) the separation of RB in mesopores on the fabric avoids the aggregation-caused self-quenching; and (2) other than singlet oxygen generation, RB is forced to undergo type I photoreaction by surrounding the RB with massive amounts of good hydrogen donors (i.e., POP) under daylight irradiation. Given the enhanced production efficiency of reactive oxygen species by the DBwEE-Cotton, 99.9999% of E. coli and L. innocua bacteria were killed within 20 min of daylight exposure. The DBwEE-Cotton also presents excellent wash and light durability with no biocidal function loss. The development of DBwEE-Cotton provides a facile strategy of avoiding aggregation-caused self-quenching and modulating photoreactions of PS on a flexible substrate, which may guide the design of novel personal protective equipment (PPE) integrated with improved biocidal efficiency, wearability, and repeated and long-term applicability for protecting people from lethal infectious diseases.","output":"Unique posture of rose Bengal for fabricating personal protective equipment with enhanced daylight-induced biocidal efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously limited to symptomatic patients, our hospital introduced on April 25, a universal admission screening strategy for COVID-19.

METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in 366 Thai participants, including 122 who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR (case group) and 244 who were SARS-CoV-2-negative (control group). Taste, smell, and appetite changes were assessed by self-reported visual analog scale. Preference for sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter, and spicy were judged using the validated TASTE-26 questionnaire. RESULTS: Partial taste and smell losses were observed in both groups, while complete losses (ageusia and anosmia) were detected only in the case group. Moreover, only ageusia and anosmia were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.001, odds ratio of 14.5 and 27.5, respectively). Taste, smell, and appetite scores were more severely reduced in the case group (P < 0.0001).

This study examined the association between loneliness and circulating eCB concentrations in grieving older adults and explored the role of eCBs on the association between baseline loneliness and grief symptom trajectories. Methods: A total of 64 adults [grief with high loneliness: n = 18; grief with low loneliness: n = 26; and healthy comparison (HC): n = 20] completed baseline clinical assessments for the UCLA loneliness scale. In grief participants, longitudinal clinical assessments, including the Inventory of Complicated Grief and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scales, were collected over 6 months. Baseline circulating eCB [N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)] concentrations were quantified in the serum using isotope dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; cortisol concentrations were measured in the same samples using radioimmunoassay. Results: Circulating AEA concentrations were higher in severely lonely grieving elders than in HC group; cortisol concentrations were not different among the groups. Cross-sectionally, loneliness scores were positively associated with AEA concentrations in grievers; this finding was not significant after accounting for depressive symptom severity. Grieving individuals who endorsed high loneliness and had higher 2-AG concentrations at baseline showed faster grief symptom resolution. Conclusions: These novel findings suggest that in lonely, bereaved elders, increased circulating eCBs, a reflection of an efficient ECS system, are associated with better adaptation to bereavement.

COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease that can lead to severe pneumonia and ARDS with potentially fatal outcome. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze risk factors, disease course and outcome of COVID-19 in patients after alloSCT. STUDY DESIGN: Patients after alloSCT who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 at German and Austrian transplant centers between February 2020 and July 2021 were included in our retrospective study on behalf of the German Cooperative Transplant Study Group. Classification of COVID-19 severity into mild, moderate-severe and critical disease and the division of the course of the pandemic into 4 phases were performed according to the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Main endpoint was overall mortality at the end of follow up. We further analyzed need for treatment on an intensive care unit (ICU) and severity of disease. Risk factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis, survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 130 patients from 14 transplant centers with a median age at diagnosis of COVID-19 of 59 (20-81) years and a median time between alloSCT and COVID-19 of 787 (19-8138) days were included. The most common underlying diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (45.4 %) and lymphoma (10.8 %). The majority of patients (84.9 %) were infected in the later phases of the pandemic. 20.8 % developed moderate-severe and 12.3 % critical disease, 19.2 % were treated on an ICU. After a median follow up of 127 days overall mortality was 16.2 %, among patients on ICU 52.0 %. Risk factors for mortality in multivariate analysis were active disease (OR 4.46), infection with SARS-CoV-2  365 days after alloSCT (OR 5.60), age > 60 years (OR 5.39) and ongoing immunosuppression with cyclosporine (OR 8.55); risk factors for developing moderate-severe or critical disease were concurrent immunosuppression (OR 4.06) and age > 40 years (OR 4.08). CONCLUSION: Patients after alloSCT exhibit a substantially increased mortality risk after COVID-19 infection compared to the normal population, without considerable improvement over the course of the pandemic. Risk factors include age, early infection post alloSCT and active immunosuppression.

Currently, there are no commonly practiced methods to non-invasively measure both resistive and elastic lung mechanics during tidal breathing, preventing the important information provided by lung mechanics from being utilised. This study presents a novel method to easily assess lung mechanics of spontaneously breathing subjects using a dynamic elastance, single-compartment lung model. METHODS: A spirometer with a built-in shutter was used to occlude expiration during tidal breathing, creating exponentially decaying flow when the shutter re-opened. The lung mechanics measured were respiratory system elastance and resistance, separated from the exponentially decaying flow, and interrupter resistance calculated at shutter closure. Progressively increasing resistance was added to the spirometer mouthpiece to simulate upper airway obstruction. The lung mechanics of 17 healthy subjects were successfully measured through spirometry. RESULTS: N = 17 (8 female, 9 male) healthy subjects were recruited. Measured decay rates ranged from 5 to 42/s, subjects with large variation of decay rates showed higher muscular breathing effort. Lung elastance measurements ranged from 3.9 to 21.2 cmH[Formula: see text] O/L, with no clear trend between change in elastance and added resistance. Resistance calculated from decay rate and elastance ranged from 0.15 to 1.95 cmH[Formula: see text] Os/L. These very small resistance values are due to the airflow measured originating from low-resistance areas in the centre of airways. Occlusion resistance measurements were as expected for healthy subjects, and increased as expected as resistance was added. CONCLUSIONS: This test was able to identify reasonable dynamic lung elastance and occlusion resistance values, providing new insight into expiratory breathing effort. Clinically, this lung function test could impact current practice. It does not require high levels of cooperation from the subject, allowing a wider cohort of patients to be assessed more easily. Additionally, this test can be simply implemented in a small standalone device, or with standard lung function testing equipment.","output":"Measuring lung mechanics of expiratory tidal breathing with non-invasive breath occlusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Much remains unknown concerning the origin of the novel pandemic coronavirus that has raged across the globe since emerging in Wuhan of Hubei province, near the center of the Peoples Republic of China, in December of 2019. All current members of the family Coronaviridae have arisen by a combination of incremental adaptive mutations, against the backdrop of many recombinational events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA sequences from diverse sources. The consensus among virologists is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, was derived from a common ancestor of a bat coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan province in 2013. Into that ancestral genetic background, several recombination events have since occurred from other divergent bat-derived coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor binding domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide breakpoint sequences, similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination naturally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure. This breakpoint sequence hypothesis provides a natural explanation for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 over time and in the wild.

The pairing of a male worm with a female worm residing in the gynaecophoral canal of male plays a critical role in the development of female parasite. Because the male specific gynaecophoral canal protein of Schistosoma japonicum (SjGCP) is found in significant quantities in the adult female worm after pairing, it could play an important role in parasite pairing. METHODS: In the present study, three small interfering (si)RNA duplexes targeting the SjGCP gene were designed, synthesized and the silencing effects were evaluated in vitro as well as in mice infected with S. japonicum in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies using semi\\\\quantitative reverse transcriptase\\\\polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR) and real\\\\time RT\\\\PCR revealed the reduction of SjGCP at the transcript level. Similarly, western blotting and immunofluorescence studies showed its reduction at the protein level after treatment of parasites with siRNAs.

To evaluate such a pairing inhibitory effect in vivo, mice infected with S. japonicum were treated with siRNA and both parasite pairing and burden were evaluated. In vivo tests confirmed the in vitro silencing effect of SjGCP siRNA and revealed that the systemic delivery of siRNA significantly inhibited early parasite pairing and the associated burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results demonstrated that the SjGCP plays an important role in pairing and subsequent development in S. japonicum, and its silencing might have potential as a therapeutic approach for controlling schistosomiasis.

Blockchain technology facilitates and secures the storage of information in such a way that doctors can see a patients entire medical history, but researchers see only statistical data instead of any personal information. Machine learning can make use of this data to notice patterns and give accurate predictions, providing more support for the patients and also in research related fields where there is a need for accurate data to predict credible results. This book examines the application of blockchain technology and machine learning algorithms in various healthcare settings, covering the basics of the technologies and exploring how they can be used to improve clinical outcomes and improving the patients experience. These topics are illustrated with reference to issues around the supply chain, drug verification, reimbursement, control access and clinical trials.

However, despite numerous reports of people globally experiencing new or exacerbated economic and/or mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, the literature on the effect of the pandemic on PWID and their risk for harm (e.g., overdose) remains sparse. The present study will describe reported changes during the pandemic in risk factors for drug overdose (including changes in mental health symptoms and care access) among PWID in Chicago, and it will examine associations between such risk factor changes and the experience of economic challenges during the pandemic. Participants from an ongoing longitudinal study of young PWID from the Chicago suburbs and their injection risk network members (N = 138; mean age = 28.7 years) were interviewed about changes in their experiences, substance use behavior, and mental health since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bivariate cross tabulations were computed of each overdose risk factor with experiences of economic challenges during the pandemic. Fishers Exact Tests were used to assess statistical significance. Adjusted logistic regression models were also conducted that controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, for time elapsed since the start of the pandemic, and for pre-pandemic income, homelessness, and injection frequency. Over half of our sample reported using alone more than usual during the pandemic, and over 40% reported using more than usual and/or buying drugs that were of a decreased purity or quality. Additionally, a large proportion of our sample (52.5% of those asked) reported more difficulty than usual accessing mental health care. Experiencing loss of a source of income during the pandemic was associated with using more drugs, using alone more, using a larger amount of drugs while using alone, wanting to stop using but being unable, and difficulty accessing mental health care. The preliminary associations found by the present study suggest that economic challenges or disruptions experienced during the pandemic are likely to increase risk for overdose among PWID experiencing such challenges, via changes in the above behaviors and/or conditions that are associated with risk for overdose. Intervention efforts should therefore be focused not only directly on overdose prevention, but also on assisting PWID with their economic challenges and helping them regain economic stability and access to services that may have been impeded by financial difficulty.","output":"Economic Challenges and Behavioral and Mental Health Risks for Overdose during the COVID-19 Pandemic among People Who Inject Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global public health crisis, for which antiviral treatments are considered mainstream therapeutic approaches.

This mirrors the well-studied exponential decline of both thymus volume and T-cell production, which halve every 16 years. COVID-19 can therefore be added to the list of other diseases with this property, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MERS-CoV, West Nile virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and certain cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and brain cancers. In addition, the incidence of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 are both higher in men, consistent with the degree to which thymic involution (and the decrease in T-cell production with age) is more severe in men compared to women. Since these properties are shared with some non-contagious diseases, we hypothesized that the age dependence does not come from social-mixing patterns, i.e. that the probability of hospitalization given infection rises exponentially, doubling every 16 years. A Bayesian analysis of daily hospitalizations, incorporating contact matrices, found that this relationship holds for every age group except for the under 20s. While older adults have fewer contacts than young adults, our analysis suggests that there is an approximate cancellation between the effects of fewer contacts for the elderly and higher infectiousness due to a higher probability of developing severe disease. Our model fitting suggests under 20s have 49-75% additional immune protection beyond that predicted by strong thymus function alone, consistent with increased juvenile cross-immunity from other viruses. We found no evidence for differences between age groups in susceptibility to infection or infectiousness to others (given disease state), i.e. the only important factor in the age dependence of hospitalization rates is the probability of hospitalization given infection. These findings suggest the existence of a T-cell exhaustion threshold, proportional to thymic output and that clonal expansion of peripheral T-cells does not affect disease risk. The strikingly simple inverse relationship between risk and thymic T-cell output adds to the evidence that thymic involution is an important factor in the decline of the immune system with age and may also be an important clue in understanding disease progression, not just for COVID-19 but other diseases as well.","output":"COVID-19 hospitalization rates rise exponentially with age, inversely proportional to thymic T-cell production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study provides a culturally sensitive quantitative investigation aimed at assessing the post-traumatic symptomatology, post-migratory difficulties, and resilience of 36 Nigerian male asylum seekers hosted in the province of Caserta, South Italy.

Several factors impact the development of this disease. This study aimed to determine the relationship between some risk factors in the development of COVID-19 among community dwellers of >= 50 years of age. This cross-sectional study was performed at Shahroud University of Medical Sciences from April 1, 2019, to June 20, 2020. Methods & Materials This cross-sectional study was conducted on individuals aged >= 50 years, including middle-aged and aging suspected of COVID-19 referring to registration centers in Shahroud University of Medical Sciences from Feb. 20th to Jun. 20th, 2020. The basis for diagnosing COVID-19 in suspected cases was a positive Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test based on a nasopharyngeal swab or Computed Tomography (CT) scan. The data used included demographic information, a history of smoking, and comorbidities. Data analysis was performed in SPSS by descriptive statistis, Chi-squared test, Independent Samples t-test, and logistic regression model. Results In the first 4 months of the COVID-19 outbreak, 3945 suspicious cases were referred to Shahroud healthcare centers. After removing the missing cases, of the 3119 registered cases, 1348 participants were aged >= 50 years. Of all eligible participants, 602 cases were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 303 were males. The obtained data suggested that the Mean +/- SD age of the study subjects was 66.62 +/- 11.33 years. Diabetes (P=0.014) and other comorbidities, such as asthma, acute respiratory, hepatic and kidney diseases, and cancer in borderline significantly increased the incidence of COVID-19 by 38% and 32%, respectively. An increase of one unit in Body Mass Index (BMI) (P=0.002) enhanced the odds of infection by 4%. Conclusion Based on the multivariate logistic regression results, high BMI and diabetes were significant risk factors in the development of COVID-19 among aged subjects. This conclusion emphasizes the importance of BMI and diabetes in the assessment of patients in middle-aged and aging groups.","output":"Investigating Some Risk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Middle-aged and Elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the gaps and trends in child immunization coverage among urban and rural areas in India, and compare the success of immunisation program in each. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Crossref, and Google Scholar electronic databases were searched on October 9, 2019, and March 21, 2020, for studies that measured and reported immunization coverage indicators in India. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were conducted. RESULTS: The authors' search identified 545 studies, and 2 were obtained by expert suggestion. Among these 68 studies and 6 surveys were included. They found that full immunization coverage has grown yearly at 2.65% and 0.82% in rural and urban areas, respectively whereas partial immunization coverage declined by ?2.44% and ?0.69%, respectively. Percentage of nonimmunized children did not show a statistically significant trend in either. CONCLUSION: While rural immunization coverage has seen a large increase over the past two decades, the progress in urban areas is weak and negligible. This was largely attributable to a focus on minimizing dropouts in rural areas. However, a lack of significant reduction in unimmunized children may indicate left-out children or pockets in both rural and urban areas. The poor performance of immunization programs in urban areas, coupled with a larger impact of COVID-19, warrants that India urgently adopts urban-sensitive and urban-focused policies and programs.

However, in many cases only incomplete datasets are available, particularly in health care applications, where each patient typically undergoes different clinical procedures or can drop out of a study. Since the data to train the neural networks need to be complete, most studies discard the incomplete datapoints, which reduces the size of the training data, or impute the missing features, which can lead to artefacts. Alas, both approaches are inadequate when a large portion of the data is missing. Here, we introduce GapNet, an alternative deep-learning training approach that can use highly incomplete datasets. First, the dataset is split into subsets of samples containing all values for a certain cluster of features. Then, these subsets are used to train individual neural networks. Finally, this ensemble of neural networks is combined into a single neural network whose training is fine-tuned using all complete datapoints. Using two highly incomplete real-world medical datasets, we show that GapNet improves the identification of patients with underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology and of patients at risk of hospitalization due to Covid-19. By distilling the information available in incomplete datasets without having to reduce their size or to impute missing values, GapNet will permit to extract valuable information from a wide range of datasets, benefiting diverse fields from medicine to engineering.","output":"Neural Network Training with Highly Incomplete Datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many hospitals have been asked to postpone elective and surgical cases.

This study explored the relationship between COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary behavior among Nigerians. The study also sought to determine whether this relationship differed for men and women. A web-based cross-sectional design approach was used to recruit 1,554 participants (mean age = 27.43, SD = 9.75; 42.7% females) from all geopolitical zones in Nigeria, through social media platforms using a snowball sampling technique. Participants responded to web-based survey forms comprising demographic questions and adapted versions of the Ebola knowledge scale, SARS risk perception scale, and precautionary behavior scale. Moderated mediation analysis of the data showed that risk perception mediated the association between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behavior and this indirect effect was in turn moderated by gender. Results indicate that having adequate knowledge of COVID-19 was linked to higher involvement in precautionary behavior through risk perception for females but not for males. It was also noted that awareness campaigns and psychological intervention strategies on COVID-19 related activities may be particularly important for males more than females. Drawing from the health belief model, we recommend that COVID-19 awareness campaigns should target raising more awareness of the risks associated with the infection to make individuals engage more in precautionary behaviors.","output":"COVID-19 Knowledge, Risk Perception, and Precautionary Behavior Among Nigerians: A Moderated Mediation Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The paper aims to present a research agenda and advisory panel for scholars, branding practitioners and marketers over a place branding perspective in the Brazilian context.

Current treatments are limited to slowing instead of stabilising or reversing disease progression. In this review, we describe mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their constituents, extracellular vesicles (EVs) as being a novel therapeutic for CKD. MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) are membrane-enclosed particles, including exosomes, which carry genetic information that mimics the phenotype of their cell of origin. MSC-EVs deliver their cargo of mRNA, miRNA, cytokines, and growth factors to target cells as a form of paracrine communication. This genetically reprograms pathophysiological pathways, which are upregulated in renal failure. Since the method of exosome preparation significantly affects the quality and function of MSC-exosomes, this review compares the methodologies for isolating exosomes from MSCs and their role in tissue regeneration. More specifically, it summarises the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-EVs in 60 preclinical animal models of AKI and CKD and the cargo of biomolecules they deliver. MSC-EVs promote tubular proliferation and angiogenesis, and inhibit apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and fibrosis, to alleviate AKI and CKD. By reprogramming these pathophysiological pathways, MSC-EVs can slow or even reverse the progression of AKI to CKD, and therefore offer potential to transform clinical practice.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles to the Rescue of Renal Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, characterized by a picture of atypical pneumonia composed of fever, dry cough and progressive dyspnea Autopsy analyzes of patients with Covid-19 were performed, and hyperactivation of cytotoxic T cells was observed, suggesting an increase in humoral-type immunological signaling, where interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a mediator present that can fit as a potential critical agent for exacerbation of inflammatory conditions In addition, not only interleukin-6, but also serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin have been recognized as strong predictors of COVID-19 severity Recent studies have shown that the use of liraglutide has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro Thus, the present case report discusses the possible anti-inflammatory properties of the antidiabetic drug liraglutide (Saxenda), in Covid-19 Clinical Case: JCMS, 45 years, male, married, obese grade 2 (BMI: 38 2), sought medical service on August 18, 2020, bringing a positive result of the RT-PCR test for Covid-19, performed in last day The patient was in good general condition, reporting mild headache and adynamia He was prescribed to start a treatment with Saxenda (6mg/ml - started 0 6mg/day at week 1, with a gradual increase up to 3mg/day at week 5);Jardiance (25mg / day);Fluimicil (600mg);Ivermectin (6mg) and Colchicine (0 5mg every 12 hours) In addition, collection of laboratory tests was requested Examination results: IL6: &amp;lt;1 5 pg/mL;Ferritin: 819 ng/ml;C-reactive protein: 5 1mg/L On August 24, the patient was tachycardic (HR 120C140 bpm) associated with headache and fever (38 C) Azithromycin (500mg), dexamethasone (4mg) and dipyrone (1g) were prescribed Collection of laboratory tests was requested Examination results: IL6: 9 3 pg/mL;Ferritin: 1085 ng/ml;C-reactive protein:23 9mg/L On September 3, the patient was in good general condition, eupneic, afebrile, with no complaints to declare On September 6, the collection of laboratory tests was requested Examination results: IL6: &amp;lt;1 5 pg/mL;Ferritin: 687 ng/ml;C-reactive protein: 1 7mg/L Conclusion: Based on the described report, it is possible to observe a good clinical and laboratory evolution of the patient with Covid-19 who, among the drugs used, made use of liraglutida Diabetes and obesity are considered significant risk factors for morbidity and mortality by COVID-19, since they are a condition of low-grade chronic inflammation and in these conditions, inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6 and ferritin have strong signs of alteration Thus, the possible beneficial effect of the administration of liraglutide in obese patients is highlighted, as a potential anti-inflammatory effect, especially in the COVID-19 era","output":"The Use of Liraglutide in Obese Patients With COVID-19: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 usually report fever and respiratory symptoms. However, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain have been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of GI symptoms, elevated liver enzymes and mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that included a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were performed from 1 December 2019 to 15 December 2020. Data were collected by conducting a literature search using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We analysed pooled data on the prevalence of individual GI symptoms and elevated liver enzymes and performed subanalyses to investigate the relationship between GI symptoms/elevated liver enzymes, geographical location, mortality, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The available data of 78 798 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 158 studies were included in our analysis. The most frequent manifestations were diarrhoea (16.5%, 95% CI 14.2% to 18.4%), nausea (9.7%, 95% CI 9.0% to 13.2%) and elevated liver enzymes (5.6%, 95% CI 4.2% to 9.1%). The overall mortality and GI mortality were 23.5% (95% CI 21.2% to 26.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI 3.1% to 6.2%), respectively.

C The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. C We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. C We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. C We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the \\"debate on chloroquine\\" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. C The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the \\"Western man\\" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. C Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","output":"Le confinement gnralis pendant lpidmie de Coronavirus: Consquences mdico-psychologiques en populations gnrales, soignantes, et de sujets souffrant antrieurement de troubles psychiques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 evades most innate immune responses, but may still be vulnerable to some. Here, we systematically analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on interferon (IFN) responses and autophagy. We show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergize to counteract antiviral immune responses. For example, Nsp14 targets the type I IFN receptor for lysosomal degradation, ORF3a prevents fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, and ORF7a interferes with autophagosome acidification.

The relationships between virus infection and the mechanisms that moderate cytokine transcription are incompletely understood. We investigated the influence of Keap1 on cytokine gene induction by Sendai virus infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Virus infection induced Keap1 binding to the Ifnb1, Tnf, and Il6 genes. Keap1 moderated viral induction of their transcription by mechanisms that did not require Nrf2. Keap1 was required for NF-B p50 recruitment, but not for NF-B p65 or IRF3 recruitment, to these genes. Keap1 formed complexes with NF-B p50 and NF-B p65, which were visualized using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis. These bimolecular fluorescence complementation complexes bound chromosomes in live cells, suggesting that Keap1 could bind chromatin in association with NF-B proteins. Keap1 was required for viral induction of G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase binding and H3K9me2 modification at cytokine genes. G9a-GLP inhibitors counteracted transcription repression by Keap1 and enhanced Keap1 and NF-B recruitment to cytokine genes. The interrelationships among Keap1, NF-B, and G9a-GLP recruitment, activities, and transcriptional effects suggest that they form a feedback circuit, which moderates viral induction of cytokine transcription. Nrf2 counteracted Keap1 binding to cytokine genes and the recruitment of NF-B p50 and G9a-GLP by Keap1. Whereas Keap1 has been reported to influence cytokine expression indirectly through its functions in the cytoplasm, these findings provide evidence that Keap1 regulates cytokine transcription directly in the nucleus. Keap1 binds to cytokines genes upon virus infection and moderates their induction by recruiting NF-B p50 and G9a-GLP.","output":"Virus Infection Induces Keap1 Binding to Cytokine Genes, Which Recruits NF-B p50 and G9a-GLP and Represses Cytokine Transcription."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a growing body of evidence indicates that besides common COVID-19 symptoms, patients may develop various neurological manifestations affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as skeletal muscles.

A vast majority of mortalities are reported in elderly patients; thus, this study aimed to evaluate complications of COVID-19 in elderly patients. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to MOOSE guidelines. Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed databases were searched for published articles related to COVID-19 in the elderly up to March 26, 2020. Search MeSh terms included \\"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\\", \\"2019-nCoV\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"comorbidity\\", \\"elderly\\", and \\"geriatrics\\". Results: In total 1360 potentially relevant articles were screened, of which 35 were relevant and their full texts were considered for the review. Organ damages to the pulmonary system, cardiovascular, liver, and renal system are more prevalent in the elderly with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the chance of multiorgan involvement is more common among elderly patients, preventive, multidisciplinary, and holistic evaluations are essential to reduce disease consequences. Conclusion: More attention needs to be paid to elderly individuals in the quarantine. Social contact should be made and maintained through online facilities, media, and phone calls to ensure patients mental health during this stressful situation. Also, they should be provided with enough food and medications by their families or friends.

A retrospective study was conducted in a 3-year period (2015C2017) on 138 dead dogs that had undergone necropsy and microbiological diagnostics. Enteritis and pneumonia were the most commonly observed lesions. Polymicrobism was more prevalent (62.3%) than single-agent infections and associated with a higher rate of generalised lesions. Ownerless dogs showed over a three-fold higher predisposition to viral coinfections than owned dogs. Above all, canine parvovirus was the most prevalent agent (77.5%), followed by canine coronavirus (31.1%) and canine adenovirus (23.9%); ownerless pups had a higher predisposition to these viruses.

We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options.

The study sample included subjects aged  18 years with a new diagnosis of varicose veins who had received at least one invasive treatment (eg, surgery, endovenous thermal ablation [radiofrequency or laser], or sclerotherapy [liquid or foam]). The adverse events of interest included a coded diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism within 30 days of a claim for invasive treatment. Patients treated between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2012, were observed for up to 2 years after diagnosis. RESULTS There were 985,632 unique subjects diagnosed with varicose veins; of them, a total of 131,887 subjects met all of the study criteria: 63,033 (47.8%) having multiple therapies; 22,980 (17.4%) having laser ablation; 21,637 (16.4%) having radiofrequency ablation; 12,708 (9.6%) having sclerotherapy; and 11,529 (8.7%) having surgery. The mean age of the sample was 52.8 years, ranging from 51.5 years (surgery cohort) to 54.5 years (radiofrequency ablation cohort); 77% of the sample was female, ranging from 71% (radiofrequency ablation cohort) to 92% (sclerotherapy cohort). The mean time to treatment after diagnosis was 105 days, ranging from 75 days (sclerotherapy cohort) to 116 days (radiofrequency ablation cohort). The diagnosed prevalence (percentage of subjects within each treatment cohort) of DVT was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, 4.4%; multiple therapies--same day, 3.4%; laser ablation, 3.1%; multiple therapies--deferred, 2.6%; surgery, 2.4%; and sclerotherapy, 0.8%.

Neuromodulation therapy, based on vagus nerve stimulation, was recently hypothesized to control both the SARS-CoV-2 replication and the ensuing inflammation likely through the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells pathway and could improve the clinical outcomes as an adjunct treatment. We proposed to test it by the stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, i.e., auricular neuromodulation (AN), a non-invasive procedure through the insertion of semipermanent needles on the ears. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of AN on the clinical outcomes in patients affected by COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial included 31 patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Within 72 h after admission, patients received either AN (n = 14) or sham neuromodulation (SN, n = 15) in addition to the conventional treatments. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of a clinical benefit conferred by AN at Day 14 (D14) as assessed by a 7-point Clinical Progression Scale. The secondary endpoint of the study was the impact of AN on the rate of transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and on the survival rate at D14. Results: The AN procedure was well-tolerated without any reported side effects but with no significant improvement for the measures of both primary (p > 0.3) and secondary (p > 0.05) endpoints at the interim analysis. None of the AN-treated patients died but one in the SN group did (81 years). Two AN-treated patients (73 and 79 years, respectively) and one SN-treated patient (59 years) were transferred to ICU. Remarkably, AN-treated patients were older with more representation by males than in the SN arm (i.e., the median age of 75 vs. 65 years, 79% male vs. 47%). Conclusion: The AN procedure, which was used within 72 h after the admission of patients with COVID-19, was safe and could be successfully implemented during the first two waves of COVID-19 in France. Nevertheless, AN did not significantly improve the outcome of the patients in our small preliminary study.

With the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are seeing increasing use of dexamethasone. This may lead to increased incidence of side effects as well. One of the side effects of dexamethasone therapy is hiccups which can range in presentation from mild and transient to persistent, causing distress and impaired quality of life. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented to the hospital with chief complaint of shortness of breath. Vitals were remarkable for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, improved with oxygen supplementation. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast both showed bilateral airspace opacities. COVID-19 PCR was positive. Patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and started on remdesevir and dexamethasone. On day 3 of therapy, patient endorsed having hiccups without aggravating or relieving factors. These hiccups were suspected to be secondary to dexamethasone after initial evaluation. Gabapentin therapy was planned for relief, but patient's hiccups resolved after 24 hours. Patient completed the remaining dexamethasone therapy without incident. DISCUSSION: This brief case highlights the importance of recognizing dexamethasone induced hiccups as a clinical entity that may increase in incidence given increasing utility of dexamethasone in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Previous studies described this phenomenon in patients who were prescribed dexamethasone for chemotherapy induced nausea. They noticed that rotating dexamethasone with prednisolone in patients who developed hiccups significantly reduced the hiccups intensity. The hiccups were thought to be due to dexamethasone being more permeable to and crossing the blood brain barrier to stimulate the hiccups reflex arc in the midbrain. For patients with COVID-19 who meet criteria for dexamethasone, it may be prudent to continue with dexamethasone despite hiccups if quality of life is not significantly impaired due to lack of convincing evidence regarding efficacy of other steroids in COVID-19. Therapies such as gabapentin, metoclopramide and baclofen have been proposed for hiccups that are significantly affecting quality of life. Dexamethasone induced hiccups usually resolve upon discontinuing the drug. As such, most patients usually require reassurance or brief pharmacotherapy for hiccups. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone may cause hiccups during the course of therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These hiccups are usual transient and resolve upon discontinuation of the drug.

There are several potential risk factors that cause the generation of HNSCC, including cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, betel quid chewing, inadequate nutrition, poor oral hygiene, HPV and EpsteinCBarr virus, and Candida albicans infections. HNSCC has causative links to both environmental factors and genetic mutations, with the latter playing a more critical role in cancer progression. These molecular changes to epithelial cells include the inactivation of cancer suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes overexpression, resulting in tumour cell proliferation and distant metastasis. HNSCC patients have impaired dendritic cell (DC) and natural killer (NK) cell functions, increased production of higher immune-suppressive molecules, loss of regulatory T cells and co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class  molecules, lower number of lymphocyte subsets, and a poor response to antigen-presenting cells. At present, the standard treatment modalities for HNSCC patients include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and combinatorial therapy. Despite advances in the development of novel treatment modalities over the last few decades, survival rates of HNSCC patients have not increased. To establish effective immunotherapies, a greater understanding of interactions between the immune system and HNSCC is required, and there is a particular need to develop novel therapeutic options. A therapeutic cancer vaccine has been proposed as a promising method to improve outcome by inducing a powerful adaptive immune response that leads to cancer cell elimination. Compared with other vaccines, peptide cancer vaccines are more robust and specific. In the past few years, there have been remarkable achievements in peptide-based vaccines for HNSCC patients. Here, we summarize the latest molecular alterations in HNSCC, explore the immune response to HNSCC, and discuss the latest developments in peptide-based cancer vaccine strategies. This review highlights areas for valuable future research focusing on peptide-based cancer vaccines.","output":"Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Risk Factors, Molecular Alterations, Immunology and Peptide Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases is a broad discipline that is almost unique in contemporary medicine with its ability to cure and prevent disease, to identify specific disease causes (microbes), and to deal with diverse, sometimes massive outbreaks.

Vessel wall MRI provides high-resolution analysis of both extracranial and intracranial vasculature to help identify previously occult lesions or characteristics of lesions that may portend a worse natural history. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be used in the acute setting as a minimally invasive way of identifying large vessel occlusions or monitoring the response to stroke treatment.

METHODS: We analysed nasopharyngeal normalized viral loads from 665 hospitalized patients included in the DisCoVeRy trial (NCT04315948; EudraCT 2020-000936-23), randomized to either standard of care (SoC) or SoCa??+a??remdesivir. We used a mathematical model to reconstruct viral kinetic profiles and estimate the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in blocking viral replication. Additional analyses were conducted stratified on time of treatment initiation (7 or >7a? days since symptom onset) or viral load at randomization (< or 3.5 log10 copies/104 cells). RESULTS: In our model, remdesivir reduced viral production by infected cells by 2-fold on average (95% CI: 1.5-3.2-fold). Model-based simulations predict that remdesivir reduced time to viral clearance by 0.7a? days compared with SoC, with large inter-individual variabilities (IQR: 0.0-1.3a? days). Remdesivir had a larger impact in patients with high viral load at randomization, reducing viral production by 5-fold on average (95% CI: 2.8-25-fold) and the median time to viral clearance by 2.4a? days (IQR: 0.9-4.5a? days). CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir halved viral production, leading to a median reduction of 0.7a? days in the time to viral clearance compared with SoC.

METHODS: Samples collected by venous blood draw and finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients. Samples were tested with Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with ELISA. RESULTS: Biolidics LFI showed clinical sensitivity of 92% with venous blood at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG.

We also highlight evidence on the deleterious synergies between sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity as the underpinnings of our case for addressing them jointly in mitigating cardiovascular risk.

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is one of the most promising biomarkers for detection of acute kidney injury (AKI), but current detection methods are inadequacy, so more rapid, convenient and accuracy methods are needed to detect NGAL for early diagnosis of AKI. Herein, we established a rapid, reliable and accuracy lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on europium nanoparticles (EU-NPS) for the detection of NGAL in human urine specimens. METHODS: A double-antibody sandwich immunofluorescent assay using europium doped nanoparticles was employed and the NGAL monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) conjugate as labels were generated by optimizing electric fusion parameters. Eighty-three urine samples were used to evaluate the clinical application efficiency of this method. RESULTS: The quantitative detection range of NGAL in AKI was 1-3000 ng/mL, and the detection sensitization was 0.36 ng/mL. The coefficient of variation (CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay were 2.57-4.98 % and 4.11-7.83 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the correlation coefficient between europium nanoparticles-based lateral fluorescence immunoassays (EU-NPS-LFIA) and ARCHITECT analyzer was significant (R(2) = 0.9829, n = 83, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, a faster and easier operation quantitative assay of NGAL for AKI has been established, which is very important and meaningful to diagnose the early AKI, suggesting that the assay can provide an early warning of final outcome of disease.

Renal tumors are often diagnosed in elderly patients, with medical comorbidities whom the risk of surgical complications may pose a greater risk of death than that due to the tumor itself.

Ovaries were excised with traumatic forceps and a blunt tip vessel sealer and divider. Temperatures of the vessel sealer and divider were recorded with a thermocouple device adhered to the tip of the instrument. Variables were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR). RESULTS Surgical time was 30 minutes (IQR, 25-32) including use of the vessel sealer and the divider for 4.1 minutes (IQR, 3.2-5.8).

It consists in applying an electric field (EF) with a frequency of 200 kHz using two pairs of transducer arrays placed on the head. Current should be injected at least 18 h/day and induce a minimum EF intensity of 1 V/cm at the tumor bed for the treatment to be effective. To avoid scalp burns, Optune, the device used to apply this technique in patients, monitors the temperature of the transducers and keeps them below 41 C by reducing the injected current. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of the uncertainty associated with the electric and thermal parameters on the predicted temperature of the transducers and of each tissue when TTFields were applied. METHODS We used a realistic head model, added the two pairs of transducers arrays on the scalp and a virtual lesion, mimicking a glioblastoma tumor in the right hemisphere. Minimum, standard and maximum values for the electric and thermal properties of each tissue were taken from the literature after an extensive review. We used finite element methods (COMSOL Multiphysics) to solve Laplace's equation for the electric potential and Pennes' equation for the temperature distribution. RESULTS We observed that the electric conductivity of the scalp and skull, as well as scalp's blood perfusion and thermal conductivity were the parameters to which tissue and transducers temperature were most sensitive to. Considering all simulations, scalp's maximum temperature was around 43.5 C, skull's 42 C, CSF's 41.2 C and brain's 39.3 C. According to the literature, for this temperature range, some physiological changes are predicted only for the brain. The average temperature of the transducers varied between 38.1 C and 41.6 C which suggests that modelling TTFields current injection is very sensitive to the parameters chosen. CONCLUSIONS Better knowledge of the physical properties of tissues and materials and how they change with the temperature is needed to improve the accuracy of these predictions. This information would likely decrease the predicted temperature maxima in the brain and thus help ascertaining TTFields safety from a thermal point of view.","output":"Heat transfer during TTFields treatment: Influence of the uncertainty of the electric and thermal parameters on the predicted temperature distribution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) infects the epithelial cells in the respiratory tract of pigs, causing a mild respiratory disease. We applied air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of well-differentiated porcine airway cells to mimic the respiratory tract epithelium in vitro and use it for analyzing the infection by PRCoV. As reported for most coronaviruses, virus entry and virus release occurred mainly via the apical membrane domain. A novel finding was that PRCoV preferentially targets non-ciliated and among them the non-mucus-producing cells. Aminopeptidase N (APN), the cellular receptor for PRCoV was also more abundantly expressed on this type of cell suggesting that APN is a determinant of the cell tropism. Interestingly, differentiation-dependent differences were found both in the expression of pAPN and the susceptibility to PRCoV infection. Cells in an early differentiation stage express higher levels of pAPN and are more susceptible to infection by PRCoV than are well-differentiated cells. A difference in the susceptibility to infection was also detected when tracheal and bronchial cells were compared. The increased susceptibility to infection of bronchial epithelial cells was, however, not due to an increased abundance of APN on the cell surface. Our data reveal a complex pattern of infection in porcine differentiated airway epithelial cells that could not be elucidated with immortalized cell lines.

This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset. Results: Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P=0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset. Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys and for estimating the true infection prevalence in populations.","output":"Serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 after mild and severe COVID-19 infection and analysis of IgG non-responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially life-threating respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe creating a massive public health problem. Previous epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor obstetrical outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This communication reviews the effects of two previous coronavirus infections - severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV - on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants including clinical, laboratory and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses.

When based on a representative sequence database, such consensus sequences can effectively be used to test immune responses in exposed and infected individuals at the population level. To accelerate immune studies in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we here describe a SARS-CoV-2 2020 consensus sequence (CoV-2-cons) which is based on more than 1700 viral genome entries in NCBI and encompasses all described SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORF), including recently described frame-shifted and length variant ORF. Based on these sequences, we created curated overlapping peptide (OLP) lists containing between 1500 to 3000 peptides of 15 and 18 amino acids in length, overlapping by 10 or 11 residues, as ideal tools for the assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. In addition, CoV-2-cons sequence entropy values are presented along with variant sequences to provide increased coverage of the most variable sections of the viral genome. The identification of conserved protein fragments across the coronavirus family and the corresponding OLP facilitate the identification of T cells potentially cross-reactive with related viruses. This new CoV-2-cons sequence, together with the peptides sets, should provide the basis for SARS-CoV-2 antigen synthesis to facilitate comparability between ex-vivo immune analyses and help to accelerate research on SARS-CoV-2 immunity and vaccine development.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Consensus-Sequence and Matching Overlapping Peptides Design for COVID19 Immune Studies and Vaccine Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is rarely greater than 14 days We report a patient with hypogammaglobulinemia who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection with a confirmed incubation period of at least 21 days These findings raise concern for a prolonged presymptomatic transmission phase, necessitating a longer quarantine duration in this patient population","output":"Prolonged incubation of SARS-CoV-2 in a Patient on Rituximab Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep neural network (DNN) architectures are considered to be robust to random perturbations.

Here, we report on the in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy of two methanolic Salix extracts, standardized to phenolic compounds, in comparison to ASA in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 peptide challenge. Using SARS-CoV-2 peptide/IL-1?- or LPS-activated human PBMCs and an inflammatory intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture, Salix extracts, and ASA concentration-dependently suppressed prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a principal mediator of inflammation. The inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity, but not protein expression was observed for ASA and one Salix extract. In activated PBMCs, the suppression of relevant cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-1?, and IL-10) was seen for both Salix extracts. The anti-inflammatory capacity of Salix extracts was still retained after transepithelial passage and liver cell metabolism in an advanced co-culture model system consisting of intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells and differentiated hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells.

Towards this end, we assess the reactions of US industries to sudden COVID-related news announcements, concomitantly with an analysis of levels of investor attention to COVID. Results suggest that, at an industry-level, for legislator trading to be ahead of the market it needed to have been done prior to February 26, and involving the 15 industries we identify as having abnormal returns, especially medical and pharmaceutical products (positive); restaurants, hotels, and motels (negative); as well as services and utilities.

BACKGROUND: Research linking nurse education, staffing, and the work environment treats these nursing resources as separate variables. Individual hospitals exhibit distinct profiles of these resources. METHODS: This cross-sectional secondary analysis used 2006 data from 692 hospitals in four states. Latent class mixture modeling was used to identify resource profiles. Regression models estimated the associations among the profiles and outcomes. RESULTS: Three profiles were identified (better, mixed, and poor) according to their nursing resource levels. Hospitals with poor profiles were disproportionately mid-sized, not-for-profit, non-teaching, urban, and had lower technology capability. Nurse job outcomes, patient mortality and care experiences were significantly improved in hospitals with better resource profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals exhibit distinct profiles of nursing resources that reflect investments into nursing. Nurse and patient outcomes and patients' experiences are improved in hospitals with better nursing resource profiles. This finding is consistent with the literature that has examined these resources independently.

Prenatal environmental adversity includes infectious agents, medication, and substances of use as well as inherently maternal factors, such as diabetes and stress. These adversities may cause long-lasting effects if occurring in sensitive time windows and, therefore, have high clinical relevance. However, our knowledge of their influence on specific cellular and molecular processes of in utero brain development remains scarce. This gap of knowledge can be partially explained by the restricted experimental access to the human embryonic and fetal brain and limited recapitulation of human-specific neurodevelopmental events in model organisms. In the past years, novel 3D human stem cell-based in vitro modeling systems, so-called brain organoids, have proven their applicability for modeling early events of human brain development in health and disease. Since their emergence, brain organoids have been successfully employed to study molecular mechanisms of Zika and Herpes simplex virus-associated microcephaly, as well as more subtle events happening upon maternal alcohol and nicotine consumption. These studies converge on pathological mechanisms targeting neural stem cells. In this review, we discuss how brain organoids have recently revealed commonalities and differences in the effects of environmental adversities on human neurogenesis. We highlight both the breakthroughs in understanding the molecular consequences of environmental exposures achieved using organoids as well as the on-going challenges in the field related to variability in protocols and a lack of benchmarking, which make cross-study comparisons difficult.","output":"The Effects of Environmental Adversities on Human Neocortical Neurogenesis Modeled in Brain Organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maritime container shipping (MCS) firms represent the backbone of worldwide supply chains.

One potential path for helping older adults with memory may be compensatory memory training programs. Compensatory memory training programs teach strategies to manage memory impairment. Traditional compensatory memory training programs tend to be highly specific to a task and often do not generalize to other memory tasks. Ecologically Oriented Neurorehabilitation of Memory (EON-Mem) is a method for teaching memory strategies that may generalize for efficient use in everyday contexts. We performed a feasibility study to determine the value of pursuing a group-based version of EON-Mem with older adults in a future larger-scale randomized controlled trial. The current feasibility study took place in two phases with two separate samples. The first sample consisted of five separate groups of healthy young adults (n=39). The second sample consisted of three separate groups of older adults (n=26). We collected data on recruitment, treatment adherence, memory improvement, drop-out rate, cost, time spent, and participant-report data on barriers to successful implementation of EON-Mem treatment. We also collected data on memory performance and overall cognitive functioning. In order to assess improvement before and after treatment within our sample, reliable change indices were calculated using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) delayed memory index score. Participants first performed a baseline assessment (traditional and ecological memory tasks, general cognition tasks, emotional functioning, demographics). After the baseline assessment, participants attended one treatment session (90 minutes) per week for a total of seven group-based EON-Mem treatment sessions. Thirty-nine young adults and 26 older adults enrolled in the study;20 young adults and 10 older adults completed the treatment sessions. We prematurely ended older adult group treatment sessions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants performed a post-intervention assessment using alternate versions when available. Attendance rates were low for the young adult sample (51% completed the treatment) and as expected for the older adult sample when accounting for COVID-related changes (77% eligible for completer status prior to cancelling sessions). Twenty percent of each sample reliably improved on the RBANS delayed memory index score before and after treatment. Costs were higher than expected ($345 and 18.6 research hours for each young adult participant;$319 and 16.9 research hours for each older adult participant). Subjectively, both samples reported enjoying the interactions with others and the presentation of the treatment, but disliked peg words. Overall, although a randomized controlled trial of group-format EON-Mem in older adults is feasible, such a study may or may not be cost-effective depending on the resources and goals of the researcher.

Developed by the World Health Organisation, Psychological First Aid (PFA) is a brief training course delivering social, emotional, supportive, and pragmatic support that can reduce the initial distress after disaster and foster future adaptive functioning. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to synthesise findings from studies exploring the usefulness of PFA for the well-being of nursing and residential care home staff. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across 15 databases (Social Care Online, Kings Fund Library, Prospero, Dynamed, BMJ Best Practice, SIGN, NICE, Ovid, Proquest, Campbell Library, Clinical Trials, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Ebsco CINAHL, and Cochrane Library), identifying peer-reviewed articles published in English language from database inception to 20th June 2021. RESULTS: Of the 1,159 articles screened, 1,146 were excluded at title and abstract; the remaining 13 articles were screened at full text, all of which were then excluded. CONCLUSION: This review highlights that empirical evidence of the impact of PFA on the well-being of nursing and residential care home staff is absent. PFA has likely been recommended to healthcare staff during the Covid-19 pandemic. The lack of evidence found here reinforces the urgent need to conduct studies which evaluates the outcomes of PFA particularly in the care home staff population.","output":"Psychological first aid for workers in care and nursing homes: systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection of circulating tumor DNA is a major challenge in liquid biopsies for cancer.

For most chemicals, the inadequacy and uncertainty of chemical-specific data severely limit the application of exposure- and risk-based methods for screening-level assessments, priority setting, and effective management. OBJECTIVE: We developed and evaluated a holistic, mechanistic modeling framework for ecological and human health assessments to support the safe and sustainable production, use, and disposal of organic chemicals. METHODS: We consolidated various models for simulating the PROduction-To-EXposure (PROTEX) continuum with empirical data sets and models for predicting chemical property and use function information to enable high-throughput (HT) exposure and risk estimation. The new PROTEX-HT framework calculates exposure and risk by integrating mechanistic computational modules describing chemical behavior and fate in the socioeconomic system (i.e., life cycle emissions), natural and indoor environments, various ecological receptors, and humans. PROTEX-HT requires only molecular structure and chemical tonnage (i.e., annual production or consumption volume) as input information. We evaluated the PROTEX-HT framework using 95 organic chemicals commercialized in the United States and demonstrated its application in various exposure and risk assessment contexts. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent and 97% of the PROTEX-HT human exposure predictions were within one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, of independent human exposure estimates inferred from biomonitoring data. PROTEX-HT supported screening and ranking chemicals based on various exposure and risk metrics, setting chemical-specific maximum allowable tonnage based on user-defined toxicological thresholds, and identifying the most relevant emission sources, environmental media, and exposure routes of concern in the PROTEX continuum. The case study shows that high chemical tonnage did not necessarily result in high exposure or health risks. CONCLUSION: Requiring only two chemical-specific pieces of information, PROTEX-HT enables efficient screening-level evaluations of existing and premanufacture chemicals in various exposure- and risk-based contexts. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9372","output":"Development and Evaluation of a Holistic and Mechanistic Modeling Framework for Chemical Emissions, Fate, Exposure, and Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing insights from multiple disciplines is essential for finding integrative solutions that are required to tackle complex environmental problems.

We model the degradation path of individual assets, to predict overall failure rates. Instead of a separate distribution for each hidden state, we use hierarchical mixtures of distributions in the exponential family. In our approach the observation distribution of the states is a finite mixture distribution of a small set of (simpler) distributions shared across all states. Using tied-mixture observation distributions offers several advantages. The mixtures act as a regularization for typically very sparse problems, and they reduce the computational effort for the learning algorithm since there are fewer distributions to be found. Using shared mixtures enables sharing of statistical strength between the Markov states and thus transfer learning.

In line with reasoning on norm activation, we found that these associations were partly mediated by personal norms, reflecting individuals' feelings of being morally compelled and personally responsible to take mitigative actions. Importantly, individuals generally reported to worry more about consequences of COVID-19 for distant others than for themselves, and worries about distant others were more strongly related to mitigative actions than worries about oneself and close others.

By analyzing all 29 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we find that only N is predicted as an LLPS protein. We further confirm the LLPS of N during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the 100,849 genome variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the GISAID database, we identify that ~37% (36,941) of the genomes contain a specific trio-nucleotide polymorphism (GGG-to-AAC) in the coding sequence of N, which leads to the amino acid substitutions, R203K/G204R. Interestingly, N(R203K/G204R) exhibits a higher propensity to undergo LLPS and a greater effect on IFN inhibition. By screening the chemicals known to interfere with N-RNA binding in other viruses, we find that (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), a polyphenol from green tea, disrupts the LLPS of N and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication.

This study was conducted to determine the most eligible natural compound to suppress ACE2 to counterfeit its interaction with the viral infection. To do this, the most known compounds of sixty-six Iraqi medicinal plants were generated and retrieved from PubChem database. After preparing a library for Iraqi medicinal plants, 3663 unique ligands conformers were docked to ACE2 using the GLIDE tool.

The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to worsen these trends. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in emergency department self-harm or suicidal ideation presentations for children and young people in New South Wales before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We studied presentations for self-harm or suicidal ideation by 10- to 24-year-olds to New South Wales emergency departments, using interrupted time series analysis to compare annualised growth before COVID (2015 to February 2020) and since COVID (March 2020 to June 2021). Subgroup analyses compared age group, gender, triage category, rurality and disadvantage. Time series decomposition via generalised additive models identified long-term, seasonal and short-term trends. RESULTS: Self-harm or suicidal ideation presentations by young people in New South Wales increased by 8.4% per annum pre-COVID. Growth accelerated since COVID, to 19.2% per annum, primarily due to increased presentations by females aged 13-17 years (47.1% per annum since COVID, from 290 per 10,000 in 2019 to 466 per 10,000 in 2021).

METHODS: A low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facility was introduced at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany, in March 2020. Irrespective of clinical symptoms employees were offered a voluntary and free SARS-CoV-2 test. Furthermore, employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions and employees after risk contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients or employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharyngeal swabs were taken and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed, test results being available within 24 hours. Profession, symptoms and reason for SARS-CoV-2 testing of employees were recorded. RESULTS: Between 9th March and 30th April 2020, a total of 1,510 employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1,185 employees took advantage of the low-threshold testing facility. One percent (n=11) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18% being asymptomatic, 36% showing mild and 36% moderate/severe symptoms (missing 10%). Furthermore, of 56 employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions, 18% (10/56) were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive.

Asthma, especially when poorly controlled, is an independent risk factor for developing pneumonia. A subset of asthmatics can have significant defects in their innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immunity arms, which may explain the increased susceptibility to infections. Adequate asthma control is associated with a significant decrease in episodes of exacerbation. Because of their wide availability and potency to promote adequate asthma control, glucocorticoids, especially inhaled ones, are the cornerstone of asthma management. The current COVID-19 pandemic affects millions of people worldwide and possesses mortality several times that of seasonal influenza; therefore, it is necessary to revisit this subject. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can potentiate the development of acute asthmatic exacerbation with the potential to worsen the state of chronic airway inflammation. The relationship is evident from several studies that show asthmatics experiencing a more adverse clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection than nonasthmatics. Recent studies show that dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, and other inhaled corticosteroids significantly reduce morbidity and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hence, while we are waiting for more studies with higher level of evidence that further narrate the association between COVID-19 and asthma, we advise clinicians to try to achieve adequate disease control in asthmatics as it may reduce incidences and severity of exacerbations especially from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Asthma and COVID-19: Emphasis on Adequate Asthma Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A molecular survey was conducted to understand recent distribution of pathogens associated with canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) in Japan.

Given this perceived importance, there was a need to continually study informal sector entrepreneurial activity and its ramifications on firm performance. Research Purpose: This study aimed to understand the link between informal sector entrepreneurial activities and firm performance using a sample of firms operating in Durban, South Africa. Motivation of the study: Exploring those entrepreneurial activities that either enhanced or impeded the informal sector was deemed critical in the effectual and efficient operation of the sector. In driving the firm performance agenda ascertaining the role of factors such as (1) entrepreneurial culture, (2) entrepreneurial education and skills, (3) government and incubation support and finally, (4) access to finance can enhance the informal sector through the provision of evidence-based interventions. Research approach/design/method: A quantitative survey research approach was used to collect data from 152 informal sector businesses operating in the city of Durban in South Africa. A convenience sampling technique was used to access the respondents. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) programme version 23 using correlation and regression tests. Main findings: The findings revealed the adoption of an entrepreneurship culture, including access to entrepreneurship education and skills to predict a firms financial and non-financial performance significantly. Furthermore, it was found that government and incubation support predicted a firms financial performance. However, it was also established that government and incubation support had no unique contribution to non-financial performance. Practical/managerial implications: Suggestions were made based on the findings that entrepreneurial activities have a bearing on informal sector business performance. These findings became a helpful intervention towards enhancing the performance of informal businesses.

Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned or newly designed assays. Results Here we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer/probe sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene. Similarly, for the SARS-CoV-2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors. Conclusions Here we applied BioLaboro in two real-world use cases to demonstrate its capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment.

Younger patients may receive myeloablative conditioning to mitigate relapse risk associated with high-risk genetics or measurable residual disease (MRD), but older adults typically receive reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) to limit toxicity. To identify factors that drive HCT outcomes in older patients, we performed targeted mutational analysis (VAF2%) on diagnostic samples from 295 AML patients age 60 or older who underwent HCT in first complete remission, 91% of whom received RIC, and targeted duplex sequencing at the time of remission in 192 patients. In a multivariable model for leukemia-free survival (LFS) including baseline genetic and clinical variables, we defined patients with low (3-year LFS 85%), intermediate (55%), high (35%), and very high risk (7%). Prior to HCT, 79.7% of patients had persistent baseline mutations, including 18.3% with only DNMT3A or TET2 mutations (DT) and 61.4% with other mutations (MRDpositive). In univariable analysis, MRD-positivity was associated with increased relapse and inferior LFS compared with DT and MRDnegative patients. However, in a multivariable model accounting for baseline risk, MRD-positivity had no independent impact on LFS, likely due to its significant association with diagnostic genetic characteristics including MDS-associated gene mutations, TP53 mutations, and high-risk karyotype. In conclusion, molecular associations with MRD positivity and transplant outcomes in older AML patients are driven primarily by baseline genetics, and not by mutations present in remission. In this group of patients, where high-intensity conditioning carries substantial risk of toxicity, alternative approaches to mitigating MRD-associated relapse risk are required.","output":"Impact of diagnostic genetics on remission MRD and transplantation outcomes in older AML patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enhanced EphA2 expression is observed in a variety of epithelial-derived malignancies and is an important target for anti-tumor therapy. Currently, Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against immune checkpoints have shown good efficacy for tumor treatment. In this study, we constructed an immune single-chain fragment variable (scFv) library using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 200 patients with a variety of malignant tumors. High affinity scFvs against EphA2 can be easily screened from the immune library using phage display technology. Anti-EphA2 scFvs can be modified into any form of recombinant antibody, including scFv-Fc and full-length IgG1 antibodies, and the recombinant antibody affinity was improved following modification. Among the modified anti-EphA2 antibodies the affinity of 77-IgG1 was significantly increased, reaching a pmol affinity level (10(?12)). We further demonstrated the binding activity of recombinant antibodies to the EphA2 protein, tumor cells, and tumor tissues using macromolecular interaction techniques, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Most importantly, both the constructed scFvs-Fc, as well as the IgG1 antibodies against EphA2 were able to inhibit the growth of tumor cells to some extent. These results suggest that the immune libraries from patients with malignant tumors are more likely to screen for antibodies with high affinity and therapeutic effect. The constructed fully human scFv immune library has broad application prospects for specific antibody screening.

More recently, autophagy has been described as a mechanism of both innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular bacteria and viruses. In this context, autophagy has been proposed as a protective mechanism against viral infection by degrading the pathogens into autolysosomes. This is strengthened by the fact that several proteins involved in interferon (IFN) signalling pathways are linked to autophagy regulation. However, several viruses have evolved strategies to divert IFN-mediated pathways and autophagy to their own benefit.

The longitudinal measures are assumed to follow a Wiener process with random drift. We apply a variant of the MCEM algorithm to compute likelihood-based estimators of the parameters in the longitudinal process model. This allows us to adapt the well-known empirical distribution function to estimate the duration distribution in the presence of missing time origin. Estimators with smooth realizations can then be obtained by conventional smoothing techniques. We establish the consistency and weak convergence of the proposed distribution estimator and present its variance estimation. We use a collection of wildland fire records from Alberta, Canada to motivate and illustrate the proposed approach. The finite-sample performance of the proposed estimator is examined by simulation. Viewing the available data as interval-censored times, we show that the proposed estimator can be more efficient than the well-established Turnbull estimator, an alternative that is often applied in such situations.

The article exploits the administrative data covering business demographics of seventy-seven Local Administrative Units (LAU1) regions over the years 2008-2020. Data were obtained from the Czech Statistical Office. The study provides insights into the short term effects of the pandemic, i.e. one year after. The results from the panel regression models and placebo tests comparing forecasted values of new businesses registrations and closures with actual values obtained after the end of 2020 do not show that there would be a significant drop in the Czech entrepreneurial activity. On the opposite, the data indicate that the Czech entrepreneurial activity grew and even increased compared with 2019. However, the obtained results need to be interpreted with caution, as many factors influenced Czech businesses development. Specifically, we mention the past economic growth, the introduction of public entrepreneurship and SME policy instruments and financial back-ups of the business owners. There are several implications of the conducted research. For instance, there is a need to observe the long-term effects of the pandemic on business demography and its structure. We propose to study changes in bankruptcy rates in the most harmed sectors such as tourism, hospitality, culture or sport and compare them with sectors that could easier transfer their business activities online.","output":"A First Years Impact of the Pandemic on the Czech Entrepreneurial Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microblogging sites, like Twitter, have emerged as ubiquitous sources of information. Two important tasks related to the automatic extraction and analysis of information in Microblogs are Entity Mention Detection (EMD) and Entity Detection (ED). The state-of-the-art EMD systems aim to model the non-literary nature of microblog text by training upon offline static datasets. They extract a combination of surface-level features -- orthographic, lexical, and semantic -- from individual messages for noisy text modeling and entity extraction. But given the constantly evolving nature of microblog streams, detecting all entity mentions from such varying yet limited context of short messages remains a difficult problem. To this end, we propose a framework named EMD Globalizer, better suited for the execution of EMD learners on microblog streams. It deviates from the processing of isolated microblog messages by existing EMD systems, where learned knowledge from the immediate context of a message is used to suggest entities. After an initial extraction of entity candidates by an EMD system, the proposed framework leverages occurrence mining to find additional candidate mentions that are missed during this first detection. Aggregating the local contextual representations of these mentions, a global embedding is drawn from the collective context of an entity candidate within a stream. The global embeddings are then utilized to separate entities within the candidates from false positives. All mentions of said entities from the stream are produced in the framework's final outputs. Our experiments show that EMD Globalizer can enhance the effectiveness of all existing EMD systems that we tested (on average by 25.61%) with a small additional computational overhead.","output":"Boosting Entity Mention Detection for Targetted Twitter Streams with Global Contextual Embeddings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide.

DESIGN/SETTING During March-June 2020, 502 workers at a Utah meat-processing facility (facility A) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using merged data from the state disease surveillance system and facility A, we analyzed the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and worker demographics, work section, and geospatial data on worker residence. We analyzed worker survey responses to questions regarding COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors at work and home. PARTICIPANTS (1) Facility A workers (n = 1373) with specimen collection dates and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results; (2) residential addresses of all persons (workers and nonworkers) with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test (n = 1036), living within the 3 counties included in the health department catchment area; and (3) facility A workers (n = 64) who agreed to participate in the knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES New cases over time, COVID-19 attack rates, worker characteristics by SARS-CoV-2 test results, geospatially clustered cases, space-time proximity of cases among workers and nonworkers; frequency of quantitative responses, crude prevalence ratios, and counts and frequency of coded responses to open-ended questions from the COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. RESULTS Statistically significant differences in race (P = .01), linguistic group (P < .001), and work section (P < .001) were found between workers with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Geographically, only 6% of cases were within statistically significant spatiotemporal case clusters. Workers reported using handwashing (57%) and social distancing (21%) as mitigation strategies outside work but reported apprehension with taking COVID-19-associated sick leave.

The crowding agent polyethylene glycol can induce bacteriophage ?29 monomeric capsid protein and dimeric scaffolding protein to co-assemble to form particles which have the same geometry as either prolate T=3 Q=5 procapsids formed in vivo or previously observed isometric particles. The formation of particles is a scaffolding-dependent reaction. The balance between the fidelity and efficiency of assembly is controlled by the concentration of crowding agent and temperature. The assembly process is salt sensitive, suggesting that the interactions between the scaffolding and coat proteins are electrostatic. Three N-terminal ?29 scaffolding protein deletion mutants, Delta 1-9, Delta 1-15 and Delta 1-22, abolish the assembly activity. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that these N-terminal deletions are accompanied by a loss of helicity. The inability of these proteins to dimerize suggests that the N-terminal region of the scaffolding protein contributes to the dimer interface and maintains the structural integrity of the dimeric protein. Two C-terminal scaffolding protein deletion mutants, Delta 79-97 and Delta 62-97, also fail to promote assembly.

Effective government communication of COVID-19 information with the public is of crucial importance. OBJECTIVE: We investigate how the most-read state-owned newspaper in China, Peoples Daily, used an online social networking site, Sina Weibo, to communicate about COVID-19 and whether this could engage the public. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated framework to examine the content, message style, and interactive features of COVID-19Crelated posts and determine their effects on public engagement in the largest social media network in China. METHODS: Content analysis was employed to scrutinize 608 COVID-19 posts, and coding was performed on three main dimensions: content, message style, and interactive features. The content dimension was coded into six subdimensions: action, new evidence, reassurance, disease prevention, health care services, and uncertainty, and the style dimension was coded into the subdimensions of narrative and nonnarrative. As for interactive features, they were coded into links to external sources, use of hashtags, use of questions to solicit feedback, and use of multimedia. Public engagement was measured in the form of the number of shares, comments, and likes on the Peoples Dailys Sina Weibo account from January 20, 2020, to March 11, 2020, to reveal the association between different levels of public engagement and communication strategies. A one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Tukey test and negative binomial regression analysis were employed to generate the results. RESULTS: We found that although the content frames of action, new evidence, and reassurance delivered in a nonnarrative style were predominant in COVID-19 communication by the government, posts related to new evidence and a nonnarrative style were strong negative predictors of the number of shares. In terms of generating a high number of shares, it was found that disease prevention posts delivered in a narrative style were able to achieve this purpose. Additionally, an interaction effect was found between content and style. The use of a narrative style in disease prevention posts had a significant positive effect on generating comments and likes by the Chinese public, while links to external sources fostered sharing. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for governments, health organizations, medical professionals, the media, and researchers on their epidemic communication to engage the public. Selecting suitable communication strategies may foster active liking and sharing of posts on social media, which in turn, might raise the publics awareness of COVID-19 and motivate them to take preventive measures. The sharing of COVID-19 posts is particularly important because this action can reach out to a large audience, potentially helping to contain the spread of the virus.","output":"Grappling With the COVID-19 Health Crisis: Content Analysis of Communication Strategies and Their Effects on Public Engagement on Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), the biochemical process oxidizing ammonium into dinitrogen gas using nitrite as an electron acceptor, has only been recognized for its significant role in the global nitrogen cycle not long ago, and its ubiquitous distribution in a wide range of environments has changed our knowledge about the contributors to the global nitrogen cycle.

AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present study, the anti-influenza virus activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products, was firstly evaluated in vitro and in ovo and their mechanism of action was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were isolated from Isatidis Radix by chiral separation. In vitro and in ovo evaluations were performed on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and embryonated eggs respectively, both using protocols including prevention, treatment and virus neutralization. Hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays were performed for further understanding of the antiviral mechanism. RESULTS: Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products all exhibited dose-dependent inhibition effect against influenza A virus (H1N1) without toxicity. The antiviral potency of the components was in the order of progoitrin > goitrin > epigoitrin > epiprogoitrin.

METHODS: Google Trends (GT) and NAVER relative search volumes (RSVs) data were collected using COVID-19-related terms in the Korean language and were retrieved according to time, gender, age groups, types of device, and location. Online queries were compared to the number of daily new COVID-19 cases and tests reported in the Kaggle open-access dataset for time period of December 5, 2019 to May 31, 2020. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were employed to assess whether correlations between new COVID-19 cases and Internet searches were affected by time.

Online queries were also stronger in women (r=0.763~0.823; p<0.05), and age groups of &#8804;29 (r=0.726~0.821; p<0.05), 30~44 (r=0.701~0.826; p<0.05), and &#8805;50 years (r=0.706~0.725; p<0.05). In terms of spatial distribution, GT and NAVER RSVs were higher in affected areas. Moreover, greater correlations were found in mobile searches (r=0.704~0.804; p<0.05) compared to those of desktop searches (r=0.705~0.717; p<0.05), indicating changing behaviors in searching for online health information during the outbreak. Those varied Internet searches related to COVID-19 represented community health risk perceptions. In addition, as a country with a high number of coronavirus tests, results showed that adults perceived coronavirus test-related information as being more important than disease-related knowledge. Meanwhile, younger and older age groups had different perceptions. Moreover, NAVER RSVs can potentially be used for health risk perception assessments and disease predictions. Adding COVID-19-related searches provided by NAVER could increase the performance of the model compared to that of the COVID-19 case-based model and potentially be used to predict epidemic curves. CONCLUSIONS: The use of both GT and NAVER RSVs to explore patterns of community health risk perceptions could be beneficial for targeting risk communication from several perspectives, including time, population characteristics, and location.","output":"Infodemiological study to understand the community risk perceptions of COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Evolving techniques in the field of therapeutic bronchoscopy have led to the return of rigid bronchoscopy in the treatment of complex central airway disease. Rigid bronchoscopy is typically performed under general anesthesia because of the strong stimulation caused by metal instruments. Anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy is challenging to administer because anesthesiologists and interventionists share the same working channel: the airway. Previously reviewed anesthetic methods are used primarily for short procedures. Balanced anesthesia with ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) block and total intravenous anesthesia might provide anesthesia for a prolonged procedure and facilitate patient recovery. PATIENT CONCERNS A patient with obstructed endobronchial stent was referred for therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy, which requires deeper anesthesia than flexible bronchoscopy. There were concerns of the stronger stimulation of the rigid bronchoscopy, lengthy duration of the procedure, higher risk of hypoxemia, and the difficulty of mechanical ventilation weaning after anesthesia due to the patients co-morbidities. DIAGNOSIS A 66-year-old female patient presented with a history of breast cancer with lung metastases. Right main bronchus obstruction due to external compression of lung metastases was relieved through insertion of an endobronchial stent, but obstructive granulation developed after 4 months. Presence of the malfunctioning stent caused severe cough and discomfort. Removal of the stent by using a flexible bronchoscope was attempted twice but failed. INTERVENTIONS Regional anesthesia of the upper airway through ultrasound-guided SLN block combined with intratracheal 2% lidocaine spray was performed to assist in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) during rigid bronchoscopy. OUTCOMES The patient maintained steady spontaneous breathing throughout the procedure without laryngospasm, bucking, or desaturation. Emergence from anesthesia was smooth and rapid after propofol infusion was discontinued. The surgery lasted 2.5 hours without discontinuity, and no perioperative pulmonary or cardiovascular complications were noted. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided SLN block is a simple technique with a high success rate and low complication rate. Application of SLN block to assist TIVA provides sufficient anesthesia for lengthened therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without interruption and facilitates patient recovery.","output":"Ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve block assists in anesthesia for bronchoscopic surgical procedure: A case report of anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selecting optimal drug repurposing combinations for further preclinical development is a challenging technical feat. Due to the toxicity of many therapeutic agents (e.g., chemotherapy), practitioners have favoured selection of synergistic compounds whereby lower doses can be used whilst maintaining high efficacy. For a fixed small molecule library, an exhaustive combinatorial chemical screen becomes infeasible to perform for academic and industry laboratories alike. Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in silico for the prediction of synergy scores. However, databases of drug combinations are highly biased towards synergistic agents and these results do not necessarily generalise out of distribution. We employ a sequential model optimization search applied to a deep learning model to quickly discover highly synergistic drug combinations active against a cancer cell line, while requiring substantially less screening than an exhaustive evaluation. Through iteratively adapting the model to newly acquired data, after only 3 rounds of ML-guided experimentation (including a calibration round), we find that the set of combinations queried by our model is enriched for highly synergistic combinations. Remarkably, we rediscovered a synergistic drug combination that was later confirmed to be under study within clinical trials.","output":"RECOVER: sequential model optimization platform for combination drug repurposing identifies novel synergistic compounds in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data analysis and visualization are essential for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, especially in epidemiological surveillance.

One of the resources which successfully employ collaborative activities is groupware, which is a virtual collaborative system that supports groups of people with common tasks or objectives and enables the management of group activities. Many research works show that educational robotics has become an important facilitating and motivating tool for students entering Computer-focused courses. Literature has shown that both tools are important for the application of a STEM approach and have led to good results in an educational environment. To analyse the learning perceptions of educational robotics in a collaborative environment, we have developed a pedagogical approach that relies on collaborative learning through a groupware called IGARA, developed on Moodle platform. Activities made available by the virtual environment were developed based on constructivist, interactionist principles, with task contextualization to enhance students' perception. In order to assess the functionality of such an approach, an exploratory study was carried out with a set of 14 students, divided into 3 groups, spatially distant due to Covid-19 pandemic safety measures.

The proposed prototype uses a zero-knowledge proof protocol to ensure the integrity of the distributed data. It uses the Markov model to track each nodes reputation score based on their interactions to predict the reliability of the nodes in consensus decision making. Analysis of the prototype demonstrates a reliable method in decision making, which concludes with overall improvements in the systems confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The result indicates that the decision protocol must be significantly considered in a reliable distribution system.

Objective To determine the efficacy of ProLung?-budesonide against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, evaluate its ability to decrease inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness in an animal model of lung inflammation. Methods SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero 76 cells were treated with ProLung?-budesonide ([0.03C 100 g/ml]) for 3 days, and virus yield in the supernatant was measured. Ovalbumin-sensitized C57BL/6 mice received aerosolized (a) ProLung?-budesonide weekly, (b) only budesonide, either daily or weekly, or (c) weekly empty ProLung?-carrier (without budesonide). All treatment groups were compared to sensitized untreated, or normal mice using histopathologic examination, electron microscopy (EM), airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to Methacholine (Mch) challenge, and eosinophil peroxidase activity (EPO) measurements in bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL).

One determinant of alphavirus virulence is nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) that contains a highly conserved MacroD-type macrodomain at the N terminus, but the roles of nsP3 and the macrodomain in virulence have not been defined. Macrodomain is a conserved protein fold found in several plus-strand RNA viruses that binds to the small molecule ADP-ribose. Prototype MacroD-type macrodomains also hydrolyze derivative linkages on the distal ribose ring. Here, we demonstrated that the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain is able to hydrolyze ADP-ribose groups from mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins. Using mass spectrometry, we unambiguously defined its substrate specificity as mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated aspartate and glutamate but not lysine residues. Mutant viruses lacking hydrolase activity were unable to replicate in mammalian BHK-21 cells or mosquito Aedes albopictus cells and rapidly reverted catalytically inactivating mutations. Mutants with reduced enzymatic activity had slower replication in mammalian neuronal cells and reduced virulence in 2-day-old mice. Therefore, nsP3 mono(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase activity is critical for CHIKV replication in both vertebrate hosts and insect vectors, and for virulence in mice.","output":"ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of Chikungunya virus macrodomain is critical for virus replication and virulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic exposed and exacerbated health disparities between socioeconomic groups. Our purpose was to determine which disparities are most prevalent and their impact on length of stay (LoS) and in hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with Covid-19. Methods De-Identified data for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was abstracted from the HCA enterprise database. Data was binned into summary tables. A negative binomial regression with LoS as the dependent variable and a logistic regression of in-hospital mortality data, using age, insurance status, sex, comorbidities as the dependent variables, were performed. Results From March 1, 2020 to August 23, 2020, of 111,849 covid testing patient records, excluding those with missing data (n=7), without confirmed COVID-19 (n=27,225), and those from a carceral environment (n=1,861), left 84,624 eligible patients. Compared to the US population, the covid cohort had more black patients (23.17% vs 13.4%). Compared to the white cohort, the black cohort had higher private insurance rates (28.52% vs. 23.68%), shorter LoS (IRR=0.97 CI=0.95-0.99, P<0.01) and lower adjusted mortality (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.97). Increasing age was associated with increased mortality and LoS. Patients with Medicare or Medicaid had longer LoS (IRR=1.07, 95% CI=1.04-1.09) and higher adjusted mortality rates (OR=1.11, 95% CI=1-1.23) than those with private insurance Conclusion Conclusions We found that when blacks have higher rates of private insurance, they have shorter hospitalizations and lower mortality than whites, when diagnosed with Covid-19.

Interventional treatment with mechanical thrombectomy-often in combination with acute stenting of underlying atherosclerotic stenosis or dissection-is increasingly used. It has been shown that such complex interventions are technically feasible. The lack of optimal management strategies and clinical data encouraged us to review our acute stroke interventions in patient with anterior circulation tandem lesions to determine lesion patterns, interventional approaches, and angiographic or clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed a series of 39 consecutive patients with intracranial vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation simultaneously presenting with high-grade cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion. RESULTS Emergency ICA stent implantation was technically feasible in all patients, and intracranial recanalization with TICI  2b was reached in a large number of patients (64 %). Good clinical outcomes (mRS  2 at 3 months) were achieved in one third of the patients (36 %). Symptomatic hemorrhages occurred in four patients (10 %). Mortality was 10 %.

We sought to ascertain the impact of rapid isothernal nucleic acid based testing for COVID-19 in an unselected cohort of pregnant women attending our maternity unit. We also assessed the correlation between community prevalence and asymptomatic carriage. METHODS: Data for the retrospective cohort study were collected from a large UK tertiary maternity unit over a 4-week period using computerised hospital records. Literature searches were performed across multiple repositories. COVID-19 prevalence was extracted from online repositories. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 457/465 (98%) women during the study period. The median turnaround time for results was 5.3 h (interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-8.9 h), with 92% of the results returned within 24 h. In our cohort, only one woman tested positive, giving a screen positive rate of 0.22% (1/457; 95% CI: 0.04-1.23%). One woman who tested negative developed a fever postnatally following discharge but was lost to follow-up. From our literature review, we did not find any correlation between asymptomatic carriage in pregnant women and the reported regional prevalence of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Testing using the SAMBA-II machine was acceptable to the vast majority of pregnant women requiring admission and had a low turnaround time.

We describe clinical-radiological characteristics, the cytokine storm parameters, and the clinical evolution of a series of patients treated with dexamethasone in the disease's initial phase.Method: A study of 8 patients who received dexamethasone before the development of COVID-19. We evaluate clinical variables, imaging tests, cytokine release parameters, treatment used and patient evolution.Results: All patients received a 6 mg/day dose with a mean duration of 4.5 days before admission. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed that most of them presented a severe extension; most patients had a slightly elevated level of cytokine release parameters.

To improve the understanding of transmission risks in six Scottish renal dialysis units, we utilised the rapid whole-genome sequencing data generated by the COG-UK consortium. METHODS: We combined geographical, temporal and genomic sequence data from the community and hospital to estimate the probability of infection originating from within the dialysis unit, the hospital or the community using Bayesian statistical modelling and compared these results to the details of epidemiological investigations. RESULTS: Of 671 patients, 60 (8.9%) became infected with SARS-CoV-2, of whom 16 (27%) died. Within-unit and community transmission were both evident and an instance of transmission from the wider hospital setting was also demonstrated.

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, controlled experimental study, paired design. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 5) METHODS: Full-thickness skin wounds (4 cm  1.5 cm) were created bilaterally on the antebrachia of 5 dogs (n = 10). Excised skin was grafted to the contralateral limb. Grafts were randomized to NPWT or bolster dressings (control; CON). NPWT was applied continuously for 7 days. Grafts were evaluated on Days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 17, biopsied on days 0, 4, 7, and 14, and had microbial culture on Day 7. Outcome variables were: time to first appearance of granulation tissue, percent graft necrosis, and percent open mesh. Significance was set at P < .05. Histologic findings, culture results, and graft appearance were reported. RESULTS Granulation tissue appeared earlier in the NPWT grafts compared with CON grafts. Percent graft necrosis and remaining open mesh area were both greater in CON grafts compared with NPWT grafts at most time points. Histologic results showed no significant difference in all variables measured, and all cultures were negative. CONCLUSIONS Variables of graft acceptance were superior when NPWT was used in the first week post-grafting. Fibroplasia was enhanced, open meshes closed more rapidly and less graft necrosis occurred with NPWT application.

METHODS 146 cases, all clinically diagnosed as SARS with positive SARS-CoV IgG, were followed up. 362 serum samples were collected from the onset of the disease to 660 days afterward. Total IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV were tested with commercial ELISA kits. For recombinant nucleoprotein and spike protein, we developed an ELISA to test these two antibodies. RESULTS Within 20 days of the onset, the positive rate of anti-SARS-CoV IgM was 46.5% (20/43); it reached a peak after 21 - 40 days (80.6%, 25/31). Then, the positive rate of IgM went down gradually to 8.2% (6/73) until 550 days after the onset. The patient's IgG positive rate was lower (34.9%, 15/43) than that of IgM within 20 days of the onset. Then it went up rapidly to 100%. It remained positive (98.6%, 70/71) until 600 - 660 days after the onset. When N-IgG and S-IgG were tested 40 days after the onset of the disease at three different times, the positive rate of N-IgG (92.5%, 37/40) was higher than that of S-IgG (67.5%, 27/40), but the two structure protein antibodies were always lower than the total IgG. CONCLUSIONS In SARS patients with definite clinical and etiological diagnosis, the highest positive rate of the antibodies against SARS-CoV was found at 21 - 40 days after the onset. IgM disappeared almost 500 days (91.8%) after the onset. Total IgG positive rate could reach 100% and 98.6% and the positivity might persist nearly two years. So it is speculated that the total IgG antibody may be positive 3 to 5 years after infection, but it seems that N-IgG and S-IgG keep positive shorter in time than total IgG antibody.","output":"[A follow up study of total IgM, IgG, nucleoprotein and spike protein antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in patients with SARS]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy provides a (bio)chemical snapshot of the sample, and was recently used in proof-of-concept cohort studies for COVID-19 saliva screening. However, the biological basis of the proposed technology has not been established. To investigate underlying pathophysiology, we conducted controlled infection experiments on Vero E6 cells in vitro and K18-hACE2 mice in vivo. Potentially infectious culture supernatant or mouse oral lavage samples were treated with ethanol or 75% (v/v) Trizol for attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy and proteomics, or RT-PCR, respectively. Controlled infection with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 elicited strong biochemical changes in culture supernatant/oral lavage despite a lack of viral replication, determined by RT-PCR or a cell culture infectious dose 50% assay. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced additional FTIR signals over UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 infection in both cell and mouse models, which correspond to aggregated proteins and RNA. Proteomics of mouse oral lavage revealed increased secretion of kallikreins and immune modulatory proteins. Next, we collected saliva from a cohort of human participants (n = 104) and developed a predictive model for COVID-19 using partial least squares discriminant analysis. While high sensitivity of 93.48% was achieved through leave-one-out cross-validation, COVID-19 patients testing negative on follow-up on the day of saliva sampling using RT-PCR was poorly predicted in this model. Importantly, COVID-19 vaccination did not lead to the misclassification of COVID-19 negatives. Finally, meta-analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 induced increases in the amide II band in all arms of this study and in recently published cohort studies, indicative of altered -sheet structures in secreted proteins. In conclusion, this study reveals a consistent secretory pathophysiological response to SARS-CoV-2, as well as a simple, robust method for COVID-19 saliva screening using ATR-FTIR.","output":"Pathophysiological Response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection Detected by Infrared Spectroscopy Enables Rapid and Robust Saliva Screening for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Mortality reduction has been a major focus of improvement for health care systems. Although several studies have noted improved sepsis-related mortality with the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems, there are no known published early warning sepsis systems using the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR system. Methods The Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MRVAMC), a large academic 1a VHA facility within the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System (NF/SGVHS), was identified as having opportunities for improvement related to inpatient mortality outcomes. Sepsis was discovered as the primary contributor to inpatient mortality for MRVAMC's acute level of care (LOC). Education along with implementation of an early warning sepsis system (EWSS) was subsequently integrated in the VHA EHR known as the Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture/ Computerized Patient Record System (VistA/CPRS) at NF/SGVHS, which applied a combination of informatics solutions within a Lean Six Sigma quality improvement framework. Results At MRVAMC, there was an observed decrease in the number of inpatient deaths for the acute LOC from a high of 48 in fiscal year (FY) 2017, quarter 3 to a low of 27 in FY 2019, quarter 4. This resulted in as large of an improvement as a 44% reduction in unadjusted mortality with education and implementation of an EWSS from FYs 2017 to 2019. Additionally, the MRVAMC acute LOC risk-adjusted mortality (standardized mortality ratio) improved from > 1.0 to < 1.0, demonstrating fewer inpatient mortalities than predicted from FYs 2017 to 2019. Conclusions Education along with the possible implementation of an EWSS within the VHA EHR was associated with improvement in unadjusted and adjusted inpatient mortality at MRVAMC.

DESIGN: This is a descriptive, qualitative study with individual semistructured interviews. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis. SETTING: Swedish primary healthcare units in both rural and urban areas. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11 primary care physicians fulfilled participation. RESULTS: Two main categories emerged: work organisation and routines and psychosocial work environment, containing three and five subcategories, respectively. The pandemic enforced changes in work organisation and routines. Increased flexibility, including more patient-oriented delivery of care, and novel means of interorganisational and intraorganisational interactions were perceived as positive by physicians. The pandemic also caused several changes in physicians psychosocial work environment. Increased workload, information overload, as well as ethical considerations and feelings of uncertainty made the work environment stressful for physicians. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic affected the working conditions of physicians in Swedish primary healthcare in numerous ways. The pandemic enforced changes in work organisation and routines for physicians in primary healthcare.

Healthcare systems worldwide are under great pressure, and there is an urgent need for effective antiviral treatments. The only currently approved antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral genome replication. SARS-CoV-2 proliferation relies on the enzymatic activities of the non-structural proteins (nsp), which makes them interesting targets for the development of new antiviral treatments. With the aim to identify novel SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we have purified the exoribonuclease/methyltransferase (nsp14) and its cofactor (nsp10) and developed biochemical assays compatible with high-throughput approaches to screen for exoribonuclease inhibitors. We have screened a library of over 5000 commercial compounds and identified patulin and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as inhibitors of nsp14 exoribonuclease in vitro. We found that patulin and ATA inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a VERO E6 cell-culture model.

Three transient gene expression methods based on PEI-mediated transfection of CHO or HEK293 cells in suspension culture in chemically-defined media were compared for rapid production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain. A high-cell-density protocol using DXB11-derived CHOBRI/rcTA cells gave substantially better yields than the other methods. Different forms of the spike were expressed, including the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a mutated/stabilized form (to favor expression of the full-length spike in prefusion conformation), with and without fusion to putative trimerization domains. An efficient two-step affinity purification method was also developed. Ultimately, we have been able to produce highly homogenous preparations of full-length spike, both monomeric and trimeric, with yields of 100-150 mg/L.

We review the utilization surges that such analyses have predicted and contrast them with the more modest utilization increments observed after past coverage expansions in the US and other affluent nations. The discrepancy between predicted and observed utilization changes suggests that analysts underestimate the role of supply-side constraints-for example, the finite number of physicians and hospital beds.

This study aimed to clarify the impact of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on pregnant patients and maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest, and Science Direct. All studies including original data; case reports, case series, descriptive and observational studies, and randomized controlled trials were searched from December 2019 until 19 March 2020. RESULTS: The search identified 1472 results and 939 abstracts were screened. 928 articles were excluded because studies did not include pregnant women. Full texts of eleven relevant studies were reviewed and finally nine studies were included in this study. The characteristics of 89 pregnant women and their neonates were studied. Results revealed that low-grade fever and cough were the principal symptoms in all patients. The main reported laboratory findings were lymphopenia, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Amino alanine transferase (ALT), and Aspartate amino transferase (AST). In all symptomatic cases, chest Computerized Tomography (CT) scans were abnormal. Fetal distress, premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor were the main prenatal complications. Two women needed intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation, one of whom developed multi-organ dysfunction and was on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). No case of maternal death was reported up to the time the studies were published. 79 mothers delivered their babies by cesarean section and five women had a vaginal delivery. No fetal infection through intrauterine vertical transmission was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Available data showed that pregnant patients in late pregnancy had clinical manifestations similar to non-pregnant adults. It appears that the risk of fetal distress, preterm delivery and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) rises with the onset of COVID-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy.

This ex vivo study evaluates the effect of anti-biofilm activity of aPDT based on emodin-chitosan nanoparticles (Emo-CS-NPs) plus blue laser light against Streptococcus mutans biofilm on the enamel surface. MATERIALS After determination of the fractional inhibitory concentration index of Emo and CS by checkerboard array assay, Emo-CS-NPs were synthesized and characterized. Following treatment of pre-formed S. mutans biofilms on the enamel slabs, cellular uptake of Emo-CS-NPs and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were determined. The anti-biofilm and anti-metabolic activities of aPDT were investigated. Eventually, lactic acid production capacity, concentrations of S. mutans extracellular DNA (eDNA) levels, and expression of the gene involved in the biofilm formation (gtfB) were evaluated. RESULTS The maximum uptake of Emo-CS-NPs occurs in an incubation time of 5 min. When irradiated, Emo-CS-NPs were photoactivated, generating ROS, and led to a decrease in the cell viability and metabolic activity of S. mutans significantly (P < 0.05). S. mutans eDNA and lactic acid production outcomes indicated that Emo-CS-NPs-mediated aPDT led to a significant reduction of eDNA levels (48%) and lactic acid production (72.4%) compared to the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, gtfB mRNA expression in S. mutans was downregulated (7.8-fold) after aPDT in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05).

Our report is especially important during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Anesthesiologists with some patients undergoing general anesthetics and having initial PACU recovery in the ORs where they had surgery can learn from the Japanese anesthesiologists with all patients recovering in ORs. METHODS The historical cohort study included all patients undergoing gynecological surgery at a US hospital (N = 785) or Japanese hospital (N = 699), with the time from OR entrance to end of surgery of at least 4 hours. RESULTS The mean times from end of surgery to OR exit were slightly longer at the US hospital than at the Japanese hospital (mean difference 1.9 minutes, P < .0001). The mean from end of surgery to discharge to surgical ward at the US hospital also was longer (P < .0001), mean difference 2.2 hours. The sample standard deviations of times from end of surgery until tracheal extubation was 40 minutes for the US hospital versus 4 minutes at the Japanese hospital (P < .0001). Prolonged times to tracheal extubation were 39% of cases at the US hospital versus 6% at the Japanese hospital; relative risk 6.40, 99% confidence interval (CI), 4.28-9.56. Neither patient demographics, case characteristics, surgeon, anesthesiologist, nor anesthesia provider significantly revised the risk ratio. There were 39% of times to extubation that were prolonged among the patients receiving neither remifentanil nor desflurane (all such patients at the US hospital) versus 6% among the patients receiving both remifentanil and desflurane (all at the Japanese hospital). The relative risk 7.12 (99% CI, 4.59-11.05) was similar to that for the hospital groups. CONCLUSIONS Differences in anesthetic practice can facilitate major differences in patient recovery soon after anesthesia, useful when the patient will recover initially in the OR or if the phase I PACU is expected to be unable to admit the patient.","output":"Comparison of Percentage Prolonged Times to Tracheal Extubation Between a Japanese Teaching Hospital and One in the United States, Without and With a Phase I Postanesthesia Care Unit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glycyrrhizin (GL) was shown to inhibit SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in vitro.

Patients were analyzed for demographic data, clinical presentations, and in-hospital outcomes and compared against 661 COVID-19-infected patients of non-medical personnel. RESULTS: Mean age of medical staff patients was 44.0513.9 years, most of whom were women (63.9%). The infected medical staff members consisted of 63 nurses (58.3%), 37 physicians (34.3%), 5 technicians (4.6%), and 3 pharmacists (2.8%). Smoking (60.2%) was the most frequent, followed by diabetes mellitus (37%). Of 108 COVID-19 infected medical staff, 18 (16.6%) were isolated in the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 14 (77.8%) were male, 16 (88.9%) were smokers, and 16 (88.9%) presented with pneumonia.

This systematic review evaluates the benefits and harms of early head-up mobilisation versus standard care in patients with severe acquired brain injury. METHODS We searched Medline, CENTRAL, EMBASE, four other databases and 13 selected clinical trial registries until April 2020. Eligible randomised clinical trials compared early head-up mobilisation versus standard care in patients with severe acquired brain injury and were analysed conducting random- and fixed-effects meta-analyses and Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA). Certainty of evidence was assessed by GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We identified four randomised clinical trials (total n = 385 patients) with severe acquired brain injury (stroke 86% and traumatic brain injury 13%). Two trials were at low risk and two at high risk of bias. We found no evidence of a difference between early mobilisation vs. standard care on mortality or poor functional outcome at end of the intervention (relative risk (RR) 1.19, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.53; I2 0%; very low certainty) or at maximal follow-up (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; I2 0%; very low certainty). We found evidence against an effect on quality of life at maximal follow-up. The proportion of patients with at least one serious adverse event did not differ at end of intervention or at maximal follow-up. For most comparisons, TSA suggested that further trials are needed. CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a difference between early mobilisation versus standard care for patients with severe acquired brain injury. Early mobilisation appeared not to exert a major impact on quality of life.

Despite alignment with known vulnerabilities such as poverty, age, and disability, the literature is inaudible on body mass. Emergency managers report little or no information on body mass prevalence. This exploratory study aimed to illustrate population prevalence of high body mass for emergency planning. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the New Zealand Health Survey were pooled for the years 2013/14 C 2017/18 (n=68 053 adults aged 15 years). Height and weight were measured and used to calculate body mass index. The prevalence of high body mass were mapped to emergency management boundary shapefiles. The resulting maps were piloted with emergency managers. RESULTS: Maps highlight the population prevalence of high body mass across emergency management regions, providing a visual tool. A pilot with 14 emergency managers assessed the utility of such mapping. On the basis of the visual information, the tool prompted 12 emergency managers to consider such groups in regional planning and to discuss needs. CONCLUSIONS: Visual mapping is a useful tool to highlight population prevalence of groups likely to be at higher risk in disasters. This is believed to be the first study to map high body mass for the purposes of emergency planning. Future research is required to identify prevalence at a finer geographical scale.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were CCECD and PCECD loss at 5 years. Secondary outcomes included prognostic factors for ECD loss: tube insertion entry site position relative to SL, AS OCT tube parameters, AC flare, and clinical factors including IOP. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (64 eyes) completed the study. The mean percentage CCECD and PCECD losses at 5 years were 36.8% and 50.1%, respectively. On univariate analysis at 5 years, a lower CCECD was associated with TIP3. Tube angle-to-anterior iris distance, TL, and TIP3 were associated with lower PCECD at 5 years. Multiple regression analysis revealed TIP3 to be associated with both lower CCECD (standardized ? coefficient, -0.27; P = 0.015) and PCECD (standardized ? coefficient, -0.23; P = 0.028). A short TL (standardized ? coefficient, 0.26; P = 0.016) also was associated with lower PCECD. The fastest rate of cell loss was associated with TIP3 for CCECD and TIP4 for PCECD.

Recently, some evidence has been emerging on the use of Ayurveda for treatment of COVID-19. The classical texts of Ayurvedic medicine such as Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita contain descriptions of pandemics of similar proportions and describe them as Janapadoddhvansa, meaning the destruction of communities, along with their causes and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The case reported herein is a 55-year-old man from Delhi, India, with confirmed (tested) COVID-19, who first took MWM for 7 days before seeking integrative therapy. The patient has comorbidities including DM, HTN, hypothyroidism and CKD and had developed symptoms including fever (which was resolved by the time integrative therapy was started), sore throat, dry cough, body aches, weakness, bad taste and smell, and heaviness in the abdomen. Based on the patients symptoms and comorbidities, a treatment plan including Ayurvedic medicines, Yoga protocol, dietary recommendations and lifestyle modifications was prescribed by a registered Ayurveda doctor and a Yoga consultant. The patient started experiencing improvement in all the symptoms within 2 days after starting the treatment; he reported approximately [Formula: see text] relief from the symptoms after 5 days, and almost complete relief within 9 days. Also, the blood sugar levels (both fasting blood sugar [FBS] and postprandial blood sugar [PPBS]) exhibited significant improvement after 5 days, and decreased to within the normal range within 12 days. Besides relief in symptoms, the patients real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test done on the 19th day returned negative results.

The application of antiviral drugs provides an immediate and direct control of influenza virus infection. At present, the major strategy for managing patients with influenza is through targeting conserved viral proteins critical for viral replication. Two classes of conventional antiviral drugs, the M2 ion channel blockers and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are frequently used. In recent years, increasing levels of resistance to both drug classes has become a major public health concern, highlighting the urgent need for the development of alternative treatments. Novel classes of antiviral compounds or biomolecules targeting viral replication mechanism are under development, using approaches including high-throughput small-molecule screening platforms and structure-based designs. In response to influenza virus infection, host cellular mechanisms are triggered to defend against the invaders.

However, prolonged cytopenias and infections substantially contribute to the toxicity burden of CAR-T. The recently developed CAR-HEMATOTOX (HT) score-composed of five pre-lymphodepletion variables (eg, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, ferritin)-enables risk stratification of hematological toxicity. METHODS In this multicenter retrospective analysis, we characterized early infection events (days 0-90) and clinical outcomes in 248 patients receiving standard-of-care CD19 CAR-T for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. This included a derivation cohort (cohort A, 179 patients) and a second independent validation cohort (cohort B, 69 patients). Cumulative incidence curves were calculated for all-grade, grade 3, and specific infection subtypes. Clinical outcomes were studied via Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS In a multivariate analysis adjusted for other baseline features, the HT score identified patients at high risk for severe infections (adjusted HR 6.4, 95% CI 3.1 to 13.1). HThigh patients more frequently developed severe infections (40% vs 8%, p<0.0001)-particularly severe bacterial infections (27% vs 0.9%, p<0.0001). Additionally, multivariate analysis of post-CAR-T factors revealed that infection risk was increased by prolonged neutropenia (14 days) and corticosteroid use (9 days), and decreased with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. Antibacterial prophylaxis significantly reduced the likelihood of severe bacterial infections in HThigh (16% vs 46%, p<0.001), but not HTlow patients (0% vs 2%, p=n.s.). Collectively, HThigh patients experienced worse median progression-free (3.4 vs 12.6 months) and overall survival (9.1 months vs not-reached), and were hospitalized longer (median 20 vs 16 days). Severe infections represented the most common cause of non-relapse mortality after CAR-T and were associated with poor survival outcomes. A trend toward increased non-relapse mortality in HThigh patients was observed (8.0% vs 3.7%, p=0.09). CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate the utility of the HT score to risk-stratify patients for infectious complications and poor survival outcomes prior to CD19 CAR-T. High-risk patients likely benefit from anti-infective prophylaxis and should be closely monitored for potential infections and relapse.","output":"The CAR-HEMATOTOX risk-stratifies patients for severe infections and disease progression after CD19 CAR-T in R/R LBCL."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a severe respiratory virus that spreads via person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets. Since being declared a pandemic in early March 2020, the World Health Organization had yet to release guidelines regarding the return of college or professional sports for the 2020-2021 season. PURPOSE: To survey the head orthopedic surgeons and primary care team physicians for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) football teams so as to gauge the management of common COVID-19 issues for the fall 2020 college football season. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The head team orthopaedic surgeons and primary care physicians for all 130 FBS football teams were surveyed regarding their opinions on the management of college football during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 30 questions regarding testing, return-to-play protocol, isolating athletes, and other management issues were posed via email survey sent on June 5, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 210 team physicians surveyed, 103 (49%) completed the questionnaire. Overall, 36.9% of respondents felt that it was unsafe for college athletes to return to playing football during fall 2020. While the majority of football programs (96.1%) were testing athletes for COVID-19 as they returned to campus, only 78.6% of programs required athletes to undergo a mandatory quarantine period before resuming involvement in athletic department activities. Of the programs that were quarantining their players upon return to campus, 20% did so for 1 week, 20% for 2 weeks, and 32.9% quarantined their athletes until they had a negative COVID-19 test. CONCLUSION: While US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines evolve and geographic regions experience a range of COVID-19 infections, determining a universal strategy for return to socialization and participation in sports remains a challenge. The current study highlighted areas of consensus and strong agreement, but the results also demonstrated a need for clarity and consistency in operations, leadership, and guidance for medical professionals in multiple areas as they attempt to safely mitigate risk for college football players amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Managing the Return to Football During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of the Head Team Physicians of the Football Bowl Subdivision Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type I interferons (IFN) and dendritic cells (DC) share an overlapping history, with rapidly accumulating evidence for vital roles for both production of type 1 IFN by DC and the interaction of this IFN both with DC and components of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Within the innate immune response, the plasmacytoid DC (pDC) are the \\"professional\\" IFN producing cells, expressing specialized toll-like receptors (TLR7 and -9) and high constitutive expression of IRF-7 that allow them to respond to viruses with rapid and extremely robust IFN production; following activation and production of IFN, the pDC subsequently mature into antigen presenting cells that help to shape the adaptive immune response. However, like most cells in the body, the myeloid or conventional DC (mDC or cDC) also produce type I IFNs, albeit typically at a lower level than that observed with pDC, and this IFN is also important in innate and adaptive immunity induced by these classic antigen presenting cells. These two major DC subsets and their IFN products interact both with each other as well as with NK cells, monocytes, T helper cells, T cytotoxic cells, T regulatory cells and B cells to orchestrate the early immune response.

They have also been implicated immunity system diseases. Therefore we aim to investigate the impact of chronic amphetamine abuse or co-abuse of alcohol with amphetamine on immunity, especially CD3 T cells, as well as the response of CD4 and CD8 T cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS A research sample comprising of 53 individuals younger than 40 years of age was employed to perform a retrospective case study within the setting of the Al-Amal Psychiatric Hospital. Individuals were distributed into 3 groups as the following: group (i) 17 patients abused amphetamine only for five years, group (ii) 17 patients' co-abused alcohol and amphetamine or five years, and group (iii) composed of 19 non-abusers of similar age and sex was selected as control. Flow cytometry was conducted for the collection and analysis of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ monoclonal antibodies from blood samples. RESULTS In contrast to the control group, amphetamine abuser patients showed a significantly decrease of the mean levels of CD3+CD4+ (#Event), CD3+CD8+ (#Event) and CD3+CD8+ (% Total). Meanwhile, levels of CD3+CD4+ (% Parent) was significantly higher in patients versus control (P = 0.001). furthermore, In the amphetamine abuse patient group, there were significant positive correlations between CD3+CD4+ (#Event) and CD3+CD4+ (% Total); CD3+CD8+ (#Event); Between CD3+CD4+ (% Parent) and CD3+CD8+ (% Parent) and CD3+CD8+ (% Total); Between CD3+CD4+ (% Total) and CD3+CD8+ (#Event); Between CD3+CD8+ % Parent) and CD3+CD8+ (% Total). CONCLUSION The present work shed light on the reaction of CD4 and CD8 T cells to chronic amphetamine and alcohol abuse, which was found to induce changes in the systemic immune response. Interestingly, amphetamine abuse markedly changes the systemic immune as they diminished CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells, and amphetamine and co-abuse alcohol affected CD3 cells significantly.","output":"Flow cytometric analysis of CD4 and T-lymphocytes of chronic amphetamine and alcohol abuse."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of our study was to report the thin-section CT findings 12 months after the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in pediatric patients who had recovered clinically but had persistent abnormal CT findings 6 months after the diagnosis. The clinical data for these patients were correlated to identify risk factors that might increase the likelihood of the development of CT abnormalities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study involved an extended 12-month thin-section CT follow-up of 16 of 47 pediatrics patients with SARS coronavirus-associated pneumonia proven serologically (21 girls and 26 boys; age range, 1.5-17 years; median age, 13.6 years). Patients' clinical information, the extent of radiographic opacification during the acute phase of illness, and conventional pulmonary function test results on follow-up were obtained for correlation. The clinical parameters were compared with other pediatric SARS patients who had normal CT findings at the 6-month follow-up. RESULTS Fifteen patients still had abnormal CT findings 12 months after diagnosis, all of whom were older than 10 years (age range, 10-17 years). In seven patients with previous residual ground-glass opacification at the 6-month follow-up, two showed persistent changes and three had a reticular pattern in the area of the previously detected abnormality, whereas two showed complete resolution. The extent of air trapping remained similar to that at the 6-month follow-up in nine of 11 patients while two showed a slight increase in the same segments. Parenchymal scars remained unchanged from the 6- to 12-month follow-up in all six patients with that finding. None of our patients showed any evidence of bronchiectasis or bronchial wall thickening. Lymphopenia (p = 0.03), extent of radiographic opacification at acute illness (p = 0.047), and duration of use of ribavirin (p = 0.03) were significant risk factors in predicting whether abnormal CT features persisted 12 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION We found that 32% of the children (15/47) affected with SARS showed thin-section CT abnormalities up to 12 months after diagnosis despite clinical remission and unremarkable pulmonary function assessment. Persistent CT abnormalities are more likely to develop in patients who are older and who present with more severe disease. The CT changes in children with SARS are, however, minor.","output":"Thin-Section CT 12 Months After the Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Pediatric Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human rhinovirus (HRV) is a nonenveloped, single stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Picornaviridae.

Overdose deaths continued to surge during the pandemic. To limit COVID-19 spread and to avoid disruptions in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including buprenorphine and methadone, US federal and state agencies granted unprecedented exemptions to existing MOUD guidelines for Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), including loosening criteria for unsupervised take-home doses. We conducted a qualitative study to evaluate the impact of these policy changes on MOUD treatment experiences for providers and patients at an OTP in California. Methods We interviewed 10 providers and 20 patients receiving MOUD. We transcribed, coded, and analyzed all interviews to identify emergent themes. Results Providers discussed clinical decision-making processes and experiences providing take-homes. Implementation of expanded take-home policies was cautious. Providers reported making individualized decisions, using patient factors to decide if benefits outweighed risks of overdose and misuse. Decision-making factors included patient drug use, overdose risk, housing status, and vulnerability to COVID-19. New patient groups started receiving take-homes and providers noted few adverse events. Patients who received take-homes reported increased autonomy and treatment flexibility, which in turn increased likelihood of treatment stabilization and engagement. Patients who remained ineligible for take-homes, usually due to ongoing non-prescribed opioid or benzodiazepine use, desired greater transparency and shared decision-making. Conclusion Federal exemptions in response to COVID-19 led to the unprecedented expansion of access to MOUD take-homes within OTPs. Providers and patients perceived benefits to expanding access to take-homes and experienced few adverse outcomes, suggesting expanded take-home policies should remain post-COVID-19. Future studies should explore whether these findings are generalizable to other OTPs and assess larger samples to quantify patient-level outcomes resulting from expanded take-home policies.","output":"The idea is to help people achieve greater success and liberty: a qualitative study of expanded methadone take-home access in opioid use disorder treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recently declared a global pandemic.

The strategy is based on rapid case notification within 1 day, case investigation within 3 days, and targeted foci response to reduce the spread of Plasmodium spp. within 7 days. Autochthonous transmission is still occurring in the country, threatening the goal of reaching malaria-free status by 2024. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the 1-3-7 strategy and identify factors associated with presence of active foci. METHODS: Data from the national malaria information system were extracted from fiscal years 2013 to 2019; after data cleaning, the final dataset included 81,012 foci. A Coxs proportional hazards model was built to investigate factors linked with the probability of becoming an active focus from 2015 to 2019 among foci that changed status from non-active to active focus during the study period. We performed a model selection technique based on the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). RESULTS: The number of yearly active foci decreased from 2227 to 2013 to 700 in 2019 (68.5 %), and the number of autochthonous cases declined from 17,553 to 3,787 (78.4 %). The best Coxs hazard model showed that foci in which vector control interventions were required were 18 % more likely to become an active focus. Increasing compliance with the 1-3-7 strategy had a protective effect, with a 22 % risk reduction among foci with over 80 % adherence to 1-3-7 timeliness protocols. Other factors associated with likelihood to become or remain an active focus include previous classification as an active focus, presence of Plasmodium falciparum infections, level of forest disturbance, and location in border provinces. CONCLUSIONS: These results identified factors that favored regression of non-active foci to active foci during the study period. The model and relative risk map align with the national malaria programs district stratification and shows strong spatial heterogeneity, with high probability to record active foci in border provinces.

Along with psychosocial consequences, it is possible that sexual behavior was also affected. AIMS: With the present study, we evaluated the impact of the community-wide containment and consequent social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health through standardized psychometric tools. METHODS: A case-control study was performed through a web-based survey and comparing subjects of both genders with (group A, N = 2,608) and without (group B, N = 4,213) sexual activity during lockdown. The Welch and chi-square tests were used to assess differences between groups. Univariate analysis of covariance, logistic regression models, and structural equation modeling were performed to measure influence and mediation effects of sexual activity on psychological, relational, and sexual outcomes. OUTCOMES: Main outcome measures were General Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Dyadic Adjustment Scale for quality of relationship and a set of well-validated sexological inventories (International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, and male-female versions of the Orgasmometer). RESULTS: Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in subjects sexually active during lockdown. Analysis of covariance identified gender, sexual activity, and living without partner during lockdown as significantly affecting anxiety and depression scores (P < .0001). Logistic regression models showed that lack of sexual activity during lockdown was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing anxiety and depression (OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.12 - 1.57, P < .001] and 1.34 [95% CI: 1.15 - 1.57, P < .0001], respectively). Structural equation modeling evidenced the protective role of sexual activity toward psychological distress (?males = -0.18 and ?females = -0.14), relational health (?males = 0.26 and ?females = 0.29) and sexual health, both directly (?males = 0.43 and ?females = 0.31), and indirectly (?males = 0.13 and ?females = 0.13). CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The demonstrated mutual influence of sexual health on psychological and relational health could direct the clinical community toward a reinterpretation of the relationship among these factors. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Based on a large number of subjects and well-validated psychometric tools, this study elucidated the protective role of sexual activity for psychological distress, as well for relational and sexual health. Main limitations were the web-based characteristics of the protocol and the retrospective nature of prelockdown data on psychorelational and sexual health of subjects recruited.

This national study aimed to compare obstetric intervention and pregnancy outcome rates in England during the pandemic and corresponding pre-pandemic calendar periods, and to assess whether differences in these rates varied according to ethnic and socioeconomic background. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a national study of singleton births in English National Health Service hospitals. We compared births during the COVID-19 pandemic period (23 March 2020 to 22 February 2021) with births during the corresponding calendar period 1 year earlier. The Hospital Episode Statistics database provided administrative hospital data about maternal characteristics, obstetric inventions (induction of labour, elective or emergency cesarean section, and instrumental birth), and outcomes (stillbirth, preterm birth, small for gestational age [SGA; birthweight < 10th centile], prolonged maternal length of stay (3 days), and maternal 42-day readmission). Multi-level logistic regression models were used to compare intervention and outcome rates between the corresponding pre-pandemic and pandemic calendar periods and to test for interactions between pandemic period and ethnic and socioeconomic background. All models were adjusted for maternal characteristics including age, obstetric history, comorbidities, and COVID-19 status at birth. The study included 948,020 singleton births (maternal characteristics: median age 30 years, 41.6% primiparous, 8.3% with gestational diabetes, 2.4% with preeclampsia, and 1.6% with pre-existing diabetes or hypertension); 451,727 births occurred during the defined pandemic period. Maternal characteristics were similar in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, stillbirth rates remained similar (0.36% pandemic versus 0.37% pre-pandemic, p = 0.16). Preterm birth and SGA birth rates were slightly lower during the pandemic (6.0% versus 6.1% for preterm births, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.94C0.97; 5.6% versus 5.8% for SGA births, aOR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93C0.96; both p < 0.001). Slightly higher rates of obstetric intervention were observed during the pandemic (40.4% versus 39.1% for induction of labour, aOR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03C1.05; 13.9% versus 12.9% for elective cesarean section, aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.11C1.14; 18.4% versus 17.0% for emergency cesarean section, aOR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06C1.08; all p < 0.001). Lower rates of prolonged maternal length of stay (16.7% versus 20.2%, aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.76C0.78, p < 0.001) and maternal readmission (3.0% versus 3.3%, aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.86C0.90, p < 0.001) were observed during the pandemic period. There was some evidence that differences in the rates of preterm birth, emergency cesarean section, and unassisted vaginal birth varied according to the mothers ethnic background but not according to her socioeconomic background. A key limitation is that multiple comparisons were made, increasing the chance of false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found very small decreases in preterm birth and SGA birth rates and very small increases in induction of labour and elective and emergency cesarean section during the COVID-19 pandemic, with some evidence of a slightly different pattern of results in women from ethnic minority backgrounds. These changes in obstetric intervention rates and pregnancy outcomes may be linked to womens behaviour, environmental exposure, changes in maternity practice, or reduced staffing levels.","output":"Obstetric interventions and pregnancy outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in England: A nationwide cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic the world is dealing with currently.

There are few treatment strategy trials, and no previous studies have investigated tailored treatment choice by disease severity. Studies in oligoarthritis (<5 inflamed joints) are limited but have suggested that some can be managed without DMARDs, preventing unnecessary side effects. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a study comparing standard DMARD treatment against symptomatic therapy in patients with mild psoriatic oligoarthritis. METHODS: This trial was embedded within the MONITOR-PsA cohort, which uses a Trials Within Cohorts (TWiCs) design. Patients with newly diagnosed psoriatic oligoarthritis, with low disease activity (PASDAS ? 3.2) and the absence of poor prognostic factors [C reactive protein (CRP) < 5 mg/dL, HAQ < 1, no radiographic erosions] were randomised open-label to either standard care with step-up DMARD therapy or to symptomatic therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local corticosteroid injections to inflamed joints. Key outcomes were the proportion of eligible cohort patients, consent and study completion rate. RESULTS: Over the 15-month study period, only one eligible patient was randomised. Although oligoarthritis patients represented 45% of patients in this early PsA cohort, the majority did not have mild disease (24% raised CRP, 51% moderate disease activity, 13% radiographic damage and/or poor function). Of those meeting trial inclusion criteria, many patients refused treatment in the observational cohort prior to an invitation into the trial as they did not wish to be treated with DMARDs. CONCLUSION: The study was not feasible as designed. Oligoarthritis represents around half of initial PsA presentations, but the majority starting therapy have high-impact disease. A small proportion have mild oligoarticular disease but many are not keen on treatment with DMARDs, given the potential side effects of these medications. Further research is needed to support evidence-based treatment in this subgroup.

Methods: In this randomised, single-blind, controlled trial, we enrolled hospitalized, non-intubated patients (18 to 75 years with oxygen saturation(Spo2) in free-air breathing []90%) with COVID-19 pneumonia at a referral hospital. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PPT (six sessions PPT with breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques) or basic care. The primary outcomes were venous blood O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2) pressures, Spo2, and three-minute walking test (3MWT) that were assessed before and end of sixth session. Secondary outcomes included level of dyspnea, venous blood PH, one-month mortality, three-month mortality and short form-36 (SF-36) after one and three months. The assessor was blinded to the assignment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04357340).

The International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) has published a guidance document recommending thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Despite standard dose LMWH thromboprophylaxis, arterial and venous thrombotic events occur in up to 30-40% of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). It is not known if patients with coagulopathy from COVID-19 benefit from higher levels of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy. No data exist regarding the comparative safety or efficacy of intermediate dose versus standard prophylactic dose LMWH. Study Design and Methods: This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label study (NCT04360824) comparing standard prophylactic dose enoxaparin (40 mg SC daily if BMI < 30 kg/m2; 30 mg SC twice daily or 40 mg SC twice daily if BMI  30 kg/m2) versus intermediate-weight adjusted dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg SC daily if BMI < 30 kg/m2 or 0.5 mg/kg SC twice daily if BMI  30 kg/m2) in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are either admitted to an intensive care unit or have a modified ISTH Overt DIC score  3. Objectives: The primary endpoint is to compare all-cause 30-day mortality of patients treated with standard prophylactic dose versus intermediate-dose enoxaparin. The secondary endpoints are to determine whether the use of standard prophylactic dose versus intermediate dose enoxaparin impacts major bleeding, arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, time to intubation or transfusion of blood products. The exploratory endpoints are to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on laboratory coagulation parameters to better understand the mechanism of COVID-19 coagulopathy compared to healthy control subjects; parameters include citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit), a component of neutrophil extracellular traps. The null hypothesis is that intermediate dose enoxaparin (intervention arm) will have a mortality rate that is not less than standard prophylactic dose enoxaparin (standard of care arm). Assuming a true margin of 20%, a sample size of 82 patients in each arm of the study is required to have 80% power when testing for a difference. Baseline Data: Three centers are currently enrolling patients. As of August 1, 2020, we have enrolled 52 patients (28 males and 24 females) with a median age of 61 years (range 24-80). 51% were Caucasian, 36% Hispanic, and 16% other ethnicities. Median BMI was 31 kg/m2 (range 20-52). Baseline D-Dimer was elevated in 95% of participants with a median of 2.23 mg/mL (range 0.39-40.32). The majority of participants had normal baseline PT, PTT, and platelet levels. All patients had fibrinogen levels over 100 mg/dL with a median of 607 mg/dL. Plasma H3Cit was elevated significantly in patients with COVID-19 (n = 21) vs healthy control subjects (n = 10) (6.48 vs 1.09 ng/mL, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Baseline data for the first 52 patients enrolled confirm the presence of multiple risk factors for thrombosis such as elevated BMI, D dimer, and plasma markers of neutrophil extracellular traps. In contrast to initial reports from China, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia was very low in our cohort. Hispanics represented 36% of our study population, compared with 19% of overall COVID-19 infections in the region, suggesting a higher severity of illness in this subpopulation. The enrollment of this trial is ongoing with the addition of sites that have larger African American populations. As safety and efficacy data mature, this study will help clarify the optimum dose of prophylactic enoxaparin to prevent COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

Social interaction is an important component of overall human wellness. In fact, social contact and social support are associated with better health and decreased mortality in humans. More studies are needed to specifically investigate how social isolation affects reproductive systems. Based on the rationale that environmental stimuli can influence hormonal cascades and therefore affect reproduction, we hypothesized that the lack of social stimuli experienced during social isolation influences the production of ovarian follicles. To test this, three-week-old female Swiss-Webster mice were placed in individual housing or in groups of three for five weeks, then their ovaries were harvested and embedded in Durcupan. From each right ovary, we cut 110 sections at 2-m thickness, 20 sections at 10-m thickness, and 100 sections at 2-m thickness. The cuts were oriented transversely to the oviduct. An observer, blind to experimental treatment, evaluated sample sections taken every 50 m by counting the total number of follicles present. In our preliminary analysis, we observed fewer follicles in individually housed mice than in group-housed mice.

Results SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all 21 known positive samples and none of the 16 negative samples. As few as approximately 5 viral copies were reliably detected. Since January 2021, many tissue types have been clinically tested. Of the 195 clinical specimens, the positivity rate was 35% with placenta and fetal tissue showing the highest percentage of positive cases. Conclusion This sensitive FFPE-based assay has broad clinical utility with applications as diverse as pregnancy loss and evaluation of liver transplant rejection. This assay will aid in understanding atypical presentations of COVID-19 as well as long-term sequelae.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA Detection in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Tissue by Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mathematically identical ordinary differential equations (ODEs) model was derived from a multiscale partial differential equations (PDEs) model of hepatitis c virus infection, which helps to overcome the limitations of the PDE model in clinical data analysis.

In the absence of government mandates, debates over issues such as mask mandates and social distancing activated conflicting moral beliefs, dividing communities. Policy scholars argue that such controversies represent fundamental frame conflicts, which arise from incommensurable worldviews, such as contested notions of liberty versus equity. This article investigates frames people constructed to make sense of coronavirus and how this affected social behavior in 2020. We conducted an interpretive framing analysis using ethnographic data from a predominately white, conservative, and rural midwestern tourist town in the United States from June to August 2020. We collected semi-structured interviews with 87 community members, observed meetings, events, and daily life. We identified four frames that individuals constructed to make sense of coronavirus: Concern, Crisis, Constraint, and Conspiracy. Concern frames illustrated how some individuals are uniquely affected and thus protect themselves. Crisis frames recognized coronavirus as a pervasive and profound threat requiring unprecedented action. Constraint frames emphasized the coronavirus response as a threat to financial stability and personal growth that should be resisted. Conspiracy frames denied its biological basis and did not compel action. These four conflicting frames demonstrate how social fragmentation, based on conflicting values, led to an incomplete pandemic response in the absence of government mandates at the national, state, and local levels in rural America. These findings provide a social rationale for public health mandates, such as masking, school/business closures, and social distancing, when contested beliefs impede collective action.","output":"A spectrum of (Dis)Belief: Coronavirus frames in a rural midwestern town in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During an outbreak or pandemic involving a novel disease such as COVID-19, infected persons may need to undergo strict medical isolation and be separated from their families for public health reasons. Such a practice raises various ethical questions, the characteristics of which are heightened by uncertainties such as mode of transmission and increasingly scarce healthcare resources. For example, under what circumstances should non-infected parents be allowed to stay with their infected children in an isolation facility? This paper will examine ethical issues with three modes of \\"family presence\\" or \\"being there or with\\" a separated family member during the current COVID-19 pandemic: physical, virtual, and surrogate. Physical visits, stays, or care by family members in isolation facilities are usually prohibited, discouraged, or limited to exceptional circumstances. Virtual presence for isolated patients is often recommended and used to enable communication. When visits are disallowed, frontline workers sometimes act as surrogate family for patients, such as performing bedside vigils for dying patients. Drawing on lessons from past outbreaks such as the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic and the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, we consider the ethical management of these modes of family presence and argue for the promotion of physical presence under some conditions.","output":"Family Presence for Patients and Separated Relatives During COVID-19: Physical, Virtual, and Surrogate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In developing regions a substantial number of users rely on legacy and ultra-low-cost mobile devices.

Overcoming or suppressing RPIAM can dramatically improve the treatment outcome. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequently diagnosed in an advanced stage and often possesses intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy accompanied by the fast development of acquired resistance during the treatment. Oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (TKs), specifically epidermal growth factor (EGF) TKs, play an important role in the activation of MAPK/PI3K/Akt/STAT pathways, finally leading to the development of RPIAM. However, the suppression of EGF-TK by different drugs is limited by various defensive mechanisms and mutations. In order to effectively prevent the development of RPIAM in NSCLC, we formulated and tested a multicomponent and multifunctional cancer targeted delivery system containing Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) as vehicles, luteinizing hormone release hormone (LHRH) as a cancer targeting moiety, EFG-TK inhibitor gefitinib and/or paclitaxel as anticancer drug(s), siRNA targeted to EGF receptor (EGFR) mRNA as a suppressor of EGF receptors, and an imaging agent (rhodamine) for the visualization of cancer cells.

Between 2019 and 2020, telehealth (TH) visits, including tele-rehabilitation (TR), increased from 11% to 46%. While many therapy interventions can be performed with verbal guidance or demonstration, objective tool-based outcomes such as goniometrics , a valuable tool to determine burn survivor progress, have proved more challenging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of confidence of therapists using three different remote methods of measuring finger range of motion (ROM). METHODS: Therapists evaluated finger ROM position of a mannequin model via a simulated TH visit using three different methods: Goniometry (GON), Visual Estimation (VE), and Electronic Protractor (EP). Pre and post-questionnaires were used to assess the participants experiences and comfort with each method of measurement. Descriptive statistics are used to report clinician opinions. A linear mixed effect model was used to determine the interaction of bias as a function of clinician characteristics (i.e., experience, familiarity, etc.). RESULTS: A total of 30 therapists and one hand surgeon participated. All reported some (30%) or a lot (70%) of familiarity with standard GON, and most reported some (30%)or a lot (40%) of familiarity with finger-specific goniometry. Post-testing, clinicians reported VE (80%) as the most difficult method and EP (73%) as the easiest. Only 7% reported feeling more confident with TR compared to in-person measurements, 27% felt equally confident, and 67% felt less confident. The average time to conduct the remote assessment measurement was 11:45 minutes using GON, 4:27 minutes using VE and 9:47 minutes using EP. There was not a significant relationship between performance bias and years of experience (p=0.587), familiarity with GON (p=0.406), familiarity with finger GON (p=0.709) or profession (p=0.281). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the transition to virtual care, the mandate for valid and accurate documentation of functional outcome measures, including ROM, remains. Our study showed that the tools used for TR may not be the same as for in-person and clinicians need to adapt their approaches and skillsets. In addition, training with these new tools is essential for clinician confidence. In addition, there was not a relationship between experience and performance, suggesting that TR joint measurement is accessible to clinicians of all experience levels with proper training.","output":"65 Therapist Confidence Utilizing Virtual Range of Motion Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Michigan State University was honored to host in-person the 27th Annual Midwest Microbial Pathogenesis Conference from 17 to 19 September 2021 in East Lansing, MI.

Imbalanced glucocorticoid production and glucocorticoid receptor activity have been linked to socioeconomically crippling neuropsychiatric disorders, and accordingly there is a need to develop in vivo models to help understand disease progression and management. Therefore, we developed the transgenic SR4G zebrafish reporter line with six glucocorticoid response elements used to promote expression of a short half-life green fluorescent protein following glucocorticoid receptor activation. Herein, we document the ability of this reporter line to respond to both chronic and acute exogenous glucocorticoid treatment. The green fluorescent protein expression in response to transgene activation was high in a variety of tissues including the brain, and provided single-cell resolution in the effected regions. The specificity of these responses is demonstrated using the partial agonist mifepristone and mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor. Importantly, the reporter line also modeled the temporal dynamics of endogenous stress response signaling, including the increased production of the glucocorticoid cortisol following hyperosmotic stress and the fluctuations of basal cortisol concentrations with the circadian rhythm.

Low detection rates in the hospital rooms may be attributable to the appropriate application of mitigation methods according to the risk control hierarchy, such as increased ventilation to 4.85 air changes per hour to create negative pressure rooms. Our work estimates the mean emission rate of patients and potential airborne concentration in the absence of ventilation.

METHODS: The survey was conducted among members of the Federation of Orthopaedic and Trauma Trainees in Europe (FORTE). It consisted of 24 questions (single-answer, multiple-answer, Likert scales). Orthopaedic trainees' demographic data (six questions), clinical role changes (four questions), institutional changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic (nine questions), and personal considerations (five questions) were examined. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-seven trainees from 23 European countries completed the survey. Most trainees retained their customary clinical role (59.8%), but a significant number was redeployed to COVID-19 units (20.9%). A drastic workload decrease during the pandemic was reported at most institutions. Only essential activities were performed at 57.1% of institutions and drastic disruptions were reported at 36.0%. Of the respondents, 52.1% stated that faculty-led education was restricted and 46.3% pursued self-guided learning, while 58.6% stated that surgical training was significantly impaired. Concerns about the achievement of annual training goals were expressed by 58.2% of the participants, while 25.0% anticipated the need for an additional year of training. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic significantly affected orthopaedic and trauma training in Europe. Most trainees felt the decrease in clinical, surgical, and educational activities would have a detrimental effect on their training.

Especially in Istanbul, the most populated city in Turkey, many hospitals served as pandemic hospitals and suspended the examination of patients who were not infected with COVID-19. On the other hand, in this period, lockdown was applied frequently to control the pandemic and to reduce the transmission. It is known that the delay in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer can sometimes be fatal. Initial treatment choice in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) patients is determined by various factors including the stage of the disease. Therefore, detection of the disease at an early stage has prognostic importance. Our aim was to compare the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and period between diagnosis and treatment initiation, as well as the distribution of stages and treatment responses in cHL patients diagnosed and treated during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the pre-pandemic period. Methods: Patients who were diagnosed within the 2 years before the pandemic (between March 2018 and March 2020) and in a 12-month period during the pandemic (between March 2020 and March 2021) were compared in terms of demographic data, disease related factors, time interval between symptom to diagnosis, and interim treatment response. Clinical data were obtained from manual and electronic medical records retrospectively. PET scans were performed at baseline, after two cycles of chemotherapy, and end of treatment (EOT). The Deauville five-point scale (5-PS) was used in the initial staging and assessment of treatment response. The 5-PS; a score of 1, 2, or 3 was considered negative. The 5-PS score 4 or 5 was positive. Results: This single-center study included 90 newly diagnosed cHL patients, with a median age of 33.5 years (range, 17 - 70 years) and a male predominance (53.3%). The most common presenting symptom was a lump in the neck (41.1%), and also, 61.1% (n=55) of the cases had at least one B symptom. Patient characteristics were summarized in Table 1. Age and sex distributions were similar in both groups. Also, the number of patients >60 years was comparable (p=0.868). The most common histopathological subtype in both groups was nodular sclerosis (47.7% vs. 48%). In the pre-pandemic period and during the pandemic, the percentages of patients with early unfavorable disease were 66.7% and 77.8%, respectively (p=0.526). Although the percentage of patients with advanced-stage disease was higher during the pandemic than that observed in the pre-pandemic period (64% vs. 53.8%), this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.384). The median interval between symptom onset to diagnosis was significantly longer during the pandemic than was observed within the pre-pandemic era (16 weeks vs. 8 weeks, p=0.042). The median durations between diagnosis and treatment initiation were similar in both groups (13 days vs. 15 days, p=0.253). The majority of patients in both groups received ABVD as first-line therapy, and IFRT was performed in some patients with early-stage cHL (Figure 1). Among all patients (n=90), 85% of the cases had negative interim PET scan results, and this percentage was similar for both patient groups (84.6% vs. 88%, p=0.999). In the pre-pandemic period, 80% of the patients had complete response at EOT, on the other hand, no comparison was performed between two groups regarding response level at EOT, since nearly half of patients (48%) treated during the pandemic were not evaluated for the EOT response at the time of the analysis. Discussion & Conclusion: In our cohort, the time interval between symptom onset to diagnosis was significantly prolonged during the pandemic. Most probably the patients were afraid of admitting to the hospital due to the fear of contagion, or patients might have experienced difficulties in applying to a health facility, and lastly maybe they had tolerable symptoms, which might all have roles in the diagnostic delay during the pandemic. Higher percentage of patients with advanced-stage disease during the pandemic might also be associated with this delay, however, fortunately, this difference did not translate into a significant difference regarding interim treatment response in both groups.

Here we address this research gap using high resolution data from Italy. We obtained daily covid-19 cases, populations at risk, and mean daily air temperature from 97 Italian cities for the period 24 February through 21 September 2020. We fitted a mixed-effects distributed lag non-linear model, presenting the effects as relative risks (RR) and cumulative relative risks (RR cum ).Negative increments in mean daily temperature produced approximately inverted U- shaped lag-responses, though for large positive increments in temperature, the peak RR occurred at the maximal lag of 14 days. The temperature exposure response curves generally showed an increased RR with increasing temperature, though the shape varied according to the lag period. Positive and negative increments in temperature caused increases and decreases in the RR cum respectively, though the plateau effect for negative increments was not observed above small positive increments in temperature.We postulate that latent variables correlated with temperature, such as frequency and duration of social activities, are the underlying cause of our observed trends.

The project addresses wind Patterns for three major criteria: pedestrian comfort, air quality, and building ventilation potential. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software was used to model velocity, PMV comfort, pressure and air age patterns for summer and winter conditions. Super-blocks with isolated towers have poor urban quality on many measures, while residents drive more and use much more energy than in traditional housing. TOD guidelines solve these problems but no discussion of urban wind patterns, air pollution, pedestrian comfort, or building ventilation which have been found important during the period of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan China. Our target was to generate TOD urban form that equaled or exceeded super-block wind performance. Results were inconclusive for pedestrian comfort and other indices and modeling are needed. Other parameters depend significantly on orientation and wind direction. Therefore, sometimes TOD was better than towers and sometimes not. The general method of the project is in six parts: 1) Assess five existing super-block designs for wind performance and characterize three performance metrics;2) Draw conclusions about performance.

In March 2013, North Korea adopted a a?Simultaneous Development Policy of Economy and Nuclear Weaponsa? at the 23rd Plenary Meeting of the 6th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and called for the revitalization of tourism by successfully creating various tourist areas, including the Wonsan and Chilbosan districts. The Five-Year Strategy for National Economic Development (2016a2020) announced at the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in May 2016 also emphasized the operation of economic development zones and revitalization of the tourism sector. In particular, since 2016, economic sanctions by the international community have expanded and deepened, making it difficult for foreign currency to flow in through foreign trade, and North Korea has become more interested in the revitalization of the tourism industry, which can also contribute to the improvement of the national image while bypassing sanctions. As if to reflect this, Chairman Kim Jong-un's tours of tourist areas and on-site guidance of major tourism areas have increased from only twice in 2016 and once in 2017, to 10 in 2018 and 11 in 2019. The major tour areas include Samjiyon City, Yangdeok Hot Spring C lture Recreation Area, and Wonsan Galma Coast Tourism Area, which are classified as the top three tourist areas. Compared to other industries, the initial investment cost of the tourism industry is relatively lower, and if a certain level of infrastructure is secured, a reasonable amount of foreign currency can be earned stably. In the case of socialist transition countries such as Vietnam and Cuba, the acquisition of foreign currency through tourism at the beginning of the transition was used as a driving force for economic growth. North Korea is also believed to harbor intentions to earn foreign currency to restore its poor industrial base by invigorating the tourism industry using its relatively well-preserved natural environment. The nation is also attempting to break away from its closed-off image and create the image of a normal country through more active tourism policies than in the past. The tourism industry is relatively free from sanctions against North Korea by the international community, making it a promising channel for inflows of foreign currency while bypassing sanctions. Above all, Kim Jong-un has experience studying in Switzerland, which has a well-developed tourism sector, and seems to have been trying to fortify the economy and improve people's lives by revitalizing the tourism industry. This study analyzes the trends in tourism policy promotion in North Korea since Chairman Kim Jong-un took office in 2012, and promotes the New Northern Policy such as multilateral tourism cooperation including North and South and the New Economic Plan of the Korean Peninsula. The intention is to provide the necessary policy implications by grasping recent changes in North Korea's tourism policy, analyzing North Korea's policy intentions, and establishing concrete and feasible multilateral tourism cooperation plans including the two Koreas. Most notably, to promote individual tourism on a humanitarian level proposed by the government, as well as individual tourism via third countries through travel agencies of third countries, and individual tourism by foreigners in a form connecting the two Koreas, we have analyzed in detail the major North Korean tourism products currently being traded, and go on to derive important implications. Chapter 2 examined the changes in tourism policies in North Korea since Kim Jong-un took power as the leader of North Korea and analyzed perceptions of the tourism industry through North Korean literature. Amid international sanctions against North Korea due to the North Korean nuclear issue, North Korea is struggling to come up with measures to develop its economy by fostering its tourism industry. It was judged that the government is trying to boost the economy by revitalizing the construction industry and in particular the development of major tourism facilities, including the hot spring cultural resort in Yangdeok-gun, which was completed in 2019, the Wonsan Galma Coast Tourism Area, which is scheduled to be completed in 2020, and the construction of Samjiyon City. North Korea has been pushing forward with an all-round economic development zone policy, requiring 18 of the 28 economic development zones to include tourism development plans. In addition, the North Korean government has been showing its willingness to foster the tourism industry through the readjustment of tourism-related physical and human infrastructure. North Korean tourism products have diversified beyond the previous simple sightseeing tourism products to experience- and life-oriented tourism products, as the state becomes more active in promoting tourism to attract tourists. Due to the North Korean government's policy demand for tourism industry development, North Korea's tourism industry-related research has also increased significantly compared to previous times. Recently, North Korean academics are focusing on areas of interest such as exploring tourism industry development in line with trends in the world tourism market, attracting foreign capital through tourism development and eco-tourism development. Regarding he analysis of trends in the global tourism market, the recent development of information processing and information and communication technology (ICT) has led to a growing number of tourists calling for more convenient and comfortable trips, which provided a glimpse into North Korea's demand when looking at the possibility of promoting smart tourism between the two Koreas in the near future. To attract foreign investment through tourism development, tourism development areas are also strategically approached by dividing them into mountain tourism development areas and coastal tourism development areas, urban tourism development areas and rural tourism development areas, cultural and traditional tourism development areas, treatment tourism development areas, resting tourism development areas and comprehensive tourism development areas. Based on this analysis, It was judged that South Korea and North Korea have the potential to develop wellness tourism products using hot springs and forest resources across the country, as well as Korean traditional medicine, healing and meditation, and beauty spa facilities. To promote the development of eco-tourism sites, North Korea has analyzed the need for eco-tourism and emphasized the fundamental purpose of eco-tourism, and makes a particularly interesting claim that ecotourism is different from ordinary tourism and requires less investment in establishing tourism volunteer facilities. Our review also revealed the North should consider developing eco-tourism centers mainly in areas that could guarantee economic efficiency, such as the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and Mt. Geumgang. Chapter 3 examined the current state of the tourism industry in North Korea through tourism resources and infrastructure by region, promotion of tourism development projects since Kim Jong-un has taken over as the leader of North Korea, and analysis of tourism products in North Korea by overseas travel agencies. As a result, it was analyzed that the environment of the North Korean tourism industry will change as follows. First, the two pillars of the North Korean tourism industry are expected to be Pyongyang and Wonsan. As of 2020, most of the North Korean tourism products started in Pyongyang, where tourism resources and infrastructure were most concentrated, and ended in Pyongyang. It was analyzed that if the development of the Galma Coast tourism area in Wonsan is carried out smoothly, it will be possible to develop products that encompass the full scope of Pyongyang and Wonsan or Pyongyang and East Sea Coast area. Secondly, as of 2020, tourism to North Korea is only conducted in limited areas, but the open areas are expected to expand further in the near future. Areas that are likely to be further developed as conditions improve are analyzed as Gangnyeong, Sukcheon in the West Sea, Eorang in the East Sea, Sakju and Onseong in the northern part of the country. Third, North Korea's leisure sports and tourism products are expected to increase as well. Since the early days of the Kim Jong-un administration, the government has built or rebuilt recreational and tourism facilities where people can enjoy a variety of leisure activities. Overseas travel agencies are also selling products that allow them to enjoy the forest and marine leisure in the East Sea region. It was judged that North Korean authoritiesa? interest in leisure sports tourism will continue to expand. Finally, it was expected that tourism products will be developed in cooperation with the Northeast Asian region when domestic and international conditions improve. Overseas travel agencies sell tourism products in cooperation with South Korea, China and Russia to North Korea, and inter-Korean cooperation tourism is conducted using flights and cruise ships. It was analyzed that if tourism to Mt. Geumgang and Gaesong is resumed, various products will continue to be developed.","output":"The Trends of North Korean Tourism Policy and the Implications for Inter-Korean Cooperation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is an essential public health measure for infectious disease prevention.

The virus facilitates host cell entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor which is present in many organs including kidneys. Kidney injury, including acute kidney injury (AKI), proteinuria and hematuria, has been a reported in COVID-19 patients. The extent of renal involvement has not been extensively correlated with prognosis and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Retrospective chart review including patients aged 18 years and older, admitted to a community hospital from March 15, 2020 to April 15, 2020, testing positive for COVID-19. Patient characteristics on admission were collected which included presence of AKI, hematuria, proteinuria and underlying CKD stage, if any. Outcomes included intubation rate, ICU admission, length of stay and inpatient-mortality. Continuous variables were compared using independent t-test. Chi-square test was used to test relationships between categorical variables. Results: A total of 212 charts were studied. After removing missing data, 186 patients were included. 22.6% (n=42) had moderate-severe underlying CKD (stage 3 or more). 38.7% (n=72) of total patients had AKI on presentation. Urinalysis was not done in 51 patients, so of the rest 135 patients, 55.6% (n=75) had hematuria and 52.6% (n=71) had proteinuria on admission. Inpatient mortality was found to be significantly higher in patients with underlying moderate-severe CKD compared to those who did not (52.4% vs 31.3%, p=0.012). Patients with hematuria on admission had significantly higher rates of intubation (37.3% vs 20%, p=0.028) and ICU admissions (44% vs 26.7%, p=0.037) compared to those who did not have hematuria on admission. Length of stay was also significantly higher in patients who had hematuria on admission compared to those who did not (108 vs 76 days, p=0.042). AKI and proteinuria on admission resulted in no significant difference in intubation, ICU admission, length of stay, or inpatient mortality. No significant difference in length of stay, intubation, and ICU admission was found in patients with underlying mod-severe CKD compared to those who didn't. Conclusion: Early renal involvement and underlying CKD worsen the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and result in higher mortality outcomes. Such patients, especially those with findings of hematuria on admission, need closer monitoring. Furthermore, many COVID-19 patients receive steroids and anticoagulants as part of treatment regimen which will need to be further evaluated as these therapies may contribute to further damage of the kidneys.","output":"Covid-19 prognosis in patients with underlying ckd and kidney related complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Typical and atypical antipsychotics are the first-line treatments for schizophrenia, but these classes of drugs are not universally effective, and they can have serious side effects that impact compliance. Antipsychotic drugs generally target the dopamine pathways with some variation. As research of schizophrenia pathophysiology has shifted away from a strictly dopamine-centric focus, the development of new pharmacotherapies has waned. A field of inquiry with centuries-old roots is gaining traction in psychiatric research circles and may represent a new frontier for drug discovery in schizophrenia. At the forefront of this investigative effort is the immune system and its many components, pathways and phenotypes, which are now known to actively engage the brain. Studies in schizophrenia reveal an intricate association of environmentally-driven immune activation in concert with a disrupted genetic template. A consistent conduit through this gene-environmental milieu is the gut-brain axis, which when dysregulated can generate pathological autoimmunity. In this review, we present epidemiological and biochemical evidence in support of an autoimmune component in schizophrenia and depict gut processes and a dysbiotic microbiome as a source and perpetuator of autoimmune dysfunction in the brain. Within this framework, we review the role of infectious agents, inflammation, gut dysbioses and autoantibody propagation on CNS pathologies such as neurotransmitter receptor hypofunction and complement pathway-mediated synaptic pruning. We then review the new pharmacotherapeutic horizon and novel agents directed to impact these pathological conditions.

Curcumin is a polyphenol found in turmeric that reduces vascular dysfunction in rodent models and humans without ADPKD. It also slows kidney cystic progression in a murine model of ADPKD. We hypothesized that oral curcumin therapy would reduce vascular endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness in children/young adults with ADPKD. Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 68 children/ young adults 6-25 years of age with ADPKD and an estimated glomerular filtration rate >80 mL/min/1.73 m2 were randomized to either curcumin supplementation (25 mg/kg body weight/day) or placebo, administered in powder form for 12 months. The co-primary outcomes were brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMDBA] and aortic pulse-wave velocity [aPWV]. We also assessed change in circulating/urine biomarkers of oxidative stress/inflammation and kidney growth (height-adjusted total kidney volume]) by magnetic resonance imaging. In a sub-group of participants 18 years, vascular oxidative stress was measured as the change in FMDBA following an acute infusion of ascorbic acid. Results: Enrolled participants were 185 [means.d.] years; 54% female; baseline FMDBA was 9.34.1 % change, and baseline aPWV was 51294 cm/sec. Fifty-seven participants completed the trial. Neither co-primary endpoint changed with curcumin (estimated change [95% confidence interval] for FMDBA (% change): curcumin: 1.14 [-0.84, 3.13]; placebo: 0.33 [-1.34, 2.00]; estimated difference for change: 0.81 [-1.21, 2.84], p=0.48; aPWV (cm/sec: curcumin: 0.6 [-25.7, 26.9]; placebo: 6.5 [-20.4, 33.5]; estimated difference for change: -5.9 [-35.8, 24.0], p=0.67) (intent to treat). There was no curcumin-specific reduction in vascular oxidative stress, nor changes in mechanistic biomarkers. Height-adjusted total kidney volume also did not change as compared to placebo.

This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological well-being and its relationship to habit and routine modifications in a sample of 584 participants on lockdown in Spain. Habits and routines were explored in relation to media and social media use, household chores, eating, drinking and sleeping habits, working and studying, exercise and leisure, and personal care. Participants reported an important increase in negative affect as well as an important decrease in positive affect during the lockdown period, compared to before the lockdown. The decline in psychological well-being was more pronounced in younger participants. There was also a notable increase in media and social media consumption, home cleaning and tidying up, eating and sleeping, cooking and baking, reading for leisure, talking or doing activities with other people in the home, and handwashing.

Therapeutic interventions to prevent endothelial activation are of great clinical significance to achieve anti-inflammatory strategy. Previous studies indicate that the total flavonoids from the endemic herbal medicine Nervilia fordii (Hance) Schltr exerts potent anti-inflammatory effect and protective effect against endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury, and shows clinical benefit in severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS). However, the exact effective component of Nervilia fordii and its potential mechanism remain unknown. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of rhamnocitrin (RH), a flavonoid extracted from Nervilia fordii, on LPS-induced endothelial activation. METHODS The in vitro endothelial cell activation model was induced by LPS in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cell viability was measured to determine the cytotoxicity of RH. RT-PCR, Western blot, fluorescent probe and immunofluorescence were conducted to evaluate the effect and mechanism of RH against endothelial activation. RESULTS RH was extracted and isolated from Nervilia fordii. RH at the concentration from 10-7 M-10-5 M inhibited the expressions of interlukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell-adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in response to LPS challenge. Mechanistically, RH repressed calcium store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) induced by LPS, which is due to downregulation of stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM-1) following upregulating microRNA-185 (miR-185). Ultimately, RH abrogated LPS-induced activation of SOCE-mediated calcineurin/NFATc3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 3) signaling pathway. CONCLUSION The present study identifies RH as a potent inhibitor of endothelial activation. Since vascular endothelial activation is a pivotal cause of excessive cytokine production, leading to cytokine storm and severe pathology in infectious diseases such as SARS and the ongoing COVID-19 pneumonia disease, RH might suggest promising therapeutic potential in the management of cytokine storm in these diseases.","output":"Rhamnocitrin extracted from Nervilia fordii inhibited vascular endothelial activation via miR-185/STIM-1/SOCE/NFATc3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first Global e-Competition on Astronomy and Astrophysics was held on-line in September-October 2020 as a replacement for the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, which was postponed due to the ongoing pandemic caused by COVID-19.

They don't find the traditional introductory topics - kinematics and Newton's laws to be relevant to their interests. That, combined with the well-known student misconceptions concerning describing motion mathematically, suggests that there's a need for a new starting point for the introductory physics sequence for life-science students. This presentation outlines a new active-learning approach that starts with the ?marble game?, which simulates diffusion - a topic that students already know is fundamental to the life sciences. Students first learn how to play the game using a hands-on activity. They then implement the game in Excel producing a live graph of diffusion that leads them to discover that Fick's law of diffusion can be explained by unbiased random jumping between two boxes. In a guided-inquiry environment, students then apply the modeling techniques they learned from the marble game to drug elimination;radioactive decay;osmosis;ligand binding;enzyme kinetics;the Boltzmann factor;thermodynamics, phase equilibrium and entropy;random walks;membrane voltage, RC circuits and the action potential;models of the spread of COVID-19;Newtonian mechanics and biomechanics. The materials focus on engaging students in computational activities using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and finite difference methods. These Excel activities allow them to discover for themselves the consequences and significance of model assumptions by reading and interpreting graphs, and by comparing model predictions with real data using linear regression and non-linear least-squares fits. A central theme of the materials is ?thermodynamics from kinetics.? I've been successfully using this active-learning approach with undergraduate students for over 15 years. It provides a guided-inquiry environment that allows students to discover for themselves that science is an evidence-based endeavor with testable hypotheses that are supported by experiment.

Hemispheric differences and relationships between these measures and hand dexterity were evaluated. RESULTS Hemispheric differences were observed for TMS and MRI measures. Bilateral hand dexterity correlated with TMS resting motor threshold and precentral gyral thickness. Transcallosal inhibition across hemispheres was positively associated with midcallosal white matter volume. Regression modeling results demonstrated that combining TMS and MRI measures predicted unique amounts of variance in hand dexterity. CONCLUSIONS RESULTS confirm and extend findings showing differences in brain structure and function after stroke.

RESULTS Mesh infection is a highly morbid complication after hernia surgery, and is associated with hospital re-admission, increased health care costs, re-operation, hernia recurrence, impaired quality of life and plaintiff litigation. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program is a particularly useful resource for the study and evidence-based practise of abdominal wall hernia repair. DISCUSSION The three major modifiable patient comorbidities significantly associated with postoperative surgical site infection in hernia surgery are obesity, tobacco smoking and diabetes mellitus. Preoperative optimization includes weight loss, cessation of smoking, and control of diabetes. Intraoperative interventions relate, in particular, to the control of fomite mediated transmission in the operating theatre and prevention of mesh contamination with S. aureus CFUs. Risk management strategies should also target the niche ecological conditions which enable bacterial survival and subsequent biofilm formation on an implanted mesh. Outcomes of mesh infection after hernia surgery are closely related to mesh type and porosity, patient smoking status, presence of MRSA, bacterial adhesion and biofilm production. The use of suction drains and the timing of drain removal are controversial and discussed in detail.

The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. METHOD: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports up to April 15th 2020. RESULTS: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented.

However, the extent to which preoperative health has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear and evidence for the mitigating effects of prehabilitation in this context has not been elucidated. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a rapid reorganization of perioperative pathways. Delayed diagnosis and surgery have caused a backlog of cases awaiting surgery increasing the risk of more complex procedures due to disease progression. Poor fitness and preoperative deconditioning are predictive of surgical complications and may be compounded by pandemic-related restrictions to accessing supportive services. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a rapid reorganization of perioperative pathways. This narrative review aims to summarize the understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on preoperative health and related behaviors and their implication for the need and delivery for prehabilitation to engender improved surgical outcomes.

RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures designed to reduce the spread of the virus, have resulted in physical deconditioning, deleterious dietary changes, substance misuse, and heightened anxiety prior to surgery. Due to the adverse health changes prior to surgery, and often protracted waiting time for surgery, there is likely an elevated risk of peri- and post-operative complications. A small number of prehabilitation services and research programmes have been rapidly adapted or implemented to address these needs. SUMMARY: During the COVID-19 pandemic to date, people undergoing surgery have faced a triple threat posed by extended wait times for surgery, reduced access to supportive services, and an elevated risk of poor outcomes. It is imperative that healthcare providers find ways to employ evidence-based prehabilitation strategies that are accessible and safe to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on surgical outcomes. Attention should be paid to cohorts most affected by established health inequities and further exacerbated by the pandemic.","output":"Physical and Psychological Health Behavior Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic that May Inform Surgical Prehabilitation: a Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interest in the practical use of herbal substances for medical purposes is growing worldwide.

This shift to virtual care can present challenges for the coordination and provision of team-based care in primary care. The current report uses extant literature on teams to provide recommendations to support integrated primary care teams, including behavioral health providers, in adapting to and sustaining virtual team-based care. METHOD: We used the Seven C's framework by Salas and colleagues (2015) to organize our findings and recommendations, focusing on coordination, cooperation, cognition, and communication. RESULTS: Integrated primary care teams may benefit from tending to both implicit and explicit forms of coordination and the use of debriefs to improve team coordination. Given the potential challenge of trust in a virtual team, documentation of care coordination and reexamination of how feedback is provided to primary care providers may benefit team cooperation. Sharing team goals and crosstraining on specific aspects of team processes, such as communicating essential information to behavioral health providers for a warm handoff, may improve the cognition of the team. Teams may also benefit by findings ways to incorporate informal communication into the workflow and using closed-loop communication to decrease missed communications. DISCUSSION: This report provides initial recommendations based on extant team literature to support integrated primary care teams in adapting to virtual care. Future work should build off this report by examining virtual integrated primary care teams and providing evidence-based recommendations to optimize virtual care.

This report presents fifteen patients who had COVID-19 respiratory illness followed by cerebrovascular events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A call by the Iranian Neurological Association gathered cases across the country who developed neurological symptoms attributed to hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke after a definite or probable Covid-19 respiratory illness. Definite cases were those with a typical respiratory illness, positive nasopharyngeal Covid-19 PCR test, and chest CT consistent with Covid-19 infection. Probable cases were defined by a typical respiratory illness, history of contacts with a Covid-19 case, and chest CT characteristic for Covid-19 infection. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (12 men and 3 women) with an age range of 38 to 93 years old (median: 65 years old) were included. Fourteen patients had a first-ever acute ischemic stroke and one patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Eleven patients (73%) had previous cardiovascular comorbidities. The median time between respiratory symptoms and neurological symptoms was seven days (range 1-16 days). Stroke severity in two patients was mild (NIHSS &#8804; 6), in six patients moderate (NIHSS: 7-12), and in seven patients severe (NIHSS &#8805;13). One patient received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator ( IV-tPA) with improved neurological symptoms. Six out of 15 patients (40%) died. All but one of those who survived had significant disability assessed by a modified ranking scale >2. The majority of patients in this case series had vascular risk factors and their stroke was associated with severe disability and death.

After such individuals have cleared the virus, only the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory can reveal the exposure, and hopefully the establishment of immune protection. With most viral infections, the presence of specific serum antibodies has provided a reliable biomarker for the exposure to the virus of interest. SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, does not reliably induce a durable antibody response, especially in sub-clinically infected individuals. Consequently, it is plausible for a recently infected individual to yield a false negative result within only a few months after exposure. Immunodiagnostic attention has therefore shifted to studies of specific T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2. Most reports published so far agree that a T cell response is engaged during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they also state that in 20-81% of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals, T cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (mega peptide pools), allegedly due to T cell cross-reactivity with Common Cold coronaviruses (CCC), or other antigens. Here we show that, by introducing irrelevant mega peptide pools as negative controls to account for chance cross-reactivity, and by establishing the antigen dose-response characteristic of the T cells, one can clearly discern between cognate T cell memory induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection vs. cross-reactive T cell responses in individuals who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Deconvoluting the T Cell Response to SARS-CoV-2: Specificity Versus Chance and Cognate Cross-Reactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Personal protective equipment (PPE) usage is pivotal in prevention of COVID19 Access to PPE for health workers has become a key concern Electronic databases were searched for studies, guidelines, reports and policies on PPE, COVID19 and respiratory infections In total 20 research articles were included, 10 guidelines and 06 reports from various health organization and National governments were included There are different types of masks available, it is essential to understand the role of each kind of mask in preventing the spread Minimizing the need for PPE in health care settings, ensuring rational and appropriate use of PPE and Coordinating PPE supply chain management mechanisms are key strategies in addressing global PPE shortage Ensuring consistent PPE standards and guidance on quality control of the PPE will help in better infection control We need to apply a risk-based approach based on purpose of use, risk of exposure, vulnerability, setting, feasibility and type of PPE Government of India is taking several steps and have deliberated on the adequacy and quality of PPEs Prevention and mitigation measures are the key for prevention of transmission in the Community which include Hand hygiene, Respiratory hygiene, maintaining social distance of two metre and wearing an appropriate PPE Adequate provision of good quality PPE is just the first step in promoting the safety of health care workers and containing the spread of COVID 19 ? 2020, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine All rights reserved","output":"Personal protective equipments (Ppe) C prerequisites, rationale and challenges during covid 19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although not always the first topic discussed when preparing for a bioemergency, the availability of a competent clinical laboratory is vital for the optimal care of a patient with a risk group 4 (RG-4) high-consequence pathogen.

Transcriptomic and proteomic trajectories uncovered a widespread metabolic remodeling commonly converging in extracellular matrix organization, lipid metabolism and signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases. The molecular singularities and specific interactome expression modules were also characterized for each viral structural factor. The intracellular molecular imbalance induced by each SARS-CoV-2 structural protein was accompanied by differential activation dynamics in survival and immunological routes in parallel with a differentiated secretion profile of chemokines in OB cells. Machine learning through a proteotranscriptomic data integration uncovered TGF-beta signaling as a confluent activation node by the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteome. Taken together, these data provide important avenues for understanding the multifunctional immunomodulatory properties of SARS-CoV-2 M, N, S and E proteins beyond their intrinsic role in virion formation, deciphering mechanistic clues to the olfactory inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Metabolic dyshomeostasis induced by SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins reveals immunological insights into viral olfactory interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM AND METHODS To analyse nationwide changes in neurointerventional center size of all German hospitals performing mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in stroke patients from 2016 to 2019. Furthermore, we assessed cross-district patient migration for MT for the first time using hospitals' structured quality reports and German Diagnosis-Related Groups data in 2019. FINDINGS Number of hospitals performing more than 100 MT procedures/year doubled in Germany from 2016 (n = 36) to 2019 (n = 71), and these neurointerventional centers performed 71% of all MT procedures in 2019. The overall increase in MT procedures was largely driven by these high-volume neurointerventional centers with ability to perform MT 24/7 (121% increase as compared with 8% increase in hospitals performing less than 100 MT procedures/year). The highest cross-district patient mobility/transfer of stroke patients for MT was observed in districts adjacent to these high-volume neurointerventional centers with existing neurovascular networks. CONCLUSION The substantial increase in MT procedures observed in Germany between 2016 and 2019 was almost exclusively delivered by high-volume stroke centers performing more than 100 MT procedures per year in established neurovascular networks.

The DI cDNA contains the hepatitis delta ribozyme sequences to generate in the transfected cells a defined 3 end. In EM studies of transfected cells virus-like particles (VLP) were observed in vesicles. Release of the particles into the medium was studied by immunoprecipitations of proteins released into the culture supernatant. Particle release was independent of S or N, but required M and E. Coexpression of E and M was sufficient for particle release. Coexpression of the structural proteins and the MIDI-HD RNA resulted in the production and release of infectious DI-particles. Infectivity of the DI-particles was determined by adding helper virus MHV-A59 to the medium containing the VLPs and using this mixture to infect new L cells. Intracellular RNA of several subsequent undiluted passages was isolated to detect the MIDI-HD RNA. Passage of the MIDI-HD RNA was dependent on the expression of the structural proteins of MHV-A59 in the transfected cells.

It has highlighted a new dependence on digital infrastructures and raised new questions regarding the resilience of internet connectivity as an alternative to travel. Pre-pandemic, we considered how telecommuting could offer an opportunity for resilience when travel was disrupted by weather extremes. We analysed five years of recorded broadband speed variation across England and Wales in order to quantify the changing demand for internet access during the working day under adverse weather conditions. Slower broadband speeds, also known as contention, are an indication of increased demand. Thus, during the working day, contention is an indication that external factors like weather can influence the choice to telecommute instead of travel. A multilevel regression model is estimated to investigate the relationship between contention during the working day and weather, whilst controlling for background spatial and demographic differences in internet services. Emergent patterns suggest that even before the pandemic, online connectivity was in greater demand when travel was disrupted or at risk of disruption.

METHODS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 was developed with individual agents able to move between 3 states (susceptible, infectious, or recovered), with each agent placed in 1 of 7 social network types and assigned a propensity to comply with NPIs (quarantine, contact tracing, and physical distancing). A series of policy questions were tested to illustrate the impact of social networks and NPI compliance on viral spread among (1) populations, (2) specific at-risk subgroups, and (3) individual trajectories. RESULTS: Simulation outcomes showed large impacts of physical distancing policies on number of infections, with substantial modification by type of social network and level of compliance. In addition, outcomes on metrics that sought to maximize those never infected (or recovered) and minimize infections and deaths showed significantly different epidemic trajectories by social network type and among higher or lower at-risk age cohorts.

Computational biomechanical models can enhance predictive capabilities to understand fundamental lung physiology; however, such investigations are hindered by the lungs complex and hierarchical structure, and the lack of mechanical experiments linking the load-bearing organ-level response to local behaviors. In this study we address these impedances by introducing a novel reduced-order surface model of the lung, combining the response of the intricate bronchial network, parenchymal tissue, and visceral pleura. The inverse finite element analysis (IFEA) framework is developed using 3-D digital image correlation (DIC) from experimentally measured non-contact strains and displacements from an ex-vivo porcine lung specimen for the first time. A custom-designed inflation device is employed to uniquely correlate the multiscale classical pressure-volume bulk breathing measures to local-level deformation topologies and principal expansion directions. Optimal material parameters are found by minimizing the error between experimental and simulation-based lung surface displacement values, using both classes of gradient-based and gradient-free optimization algorithms and by developing an adjoint formulation for efficiency. The heterogeneous and anisotropic characteristics of pulmonary breathing are represented using various hyperelastic continuum formulations to divulge compound material parameters and evaluate the best performing model. While accounting for tissue anisotropy with fibers assumed along medial-lateral direction did not benefit model calibration, allowing for regional material heterogeneity enabled accurate reconstruction of lung deformations when compared to the homogeneous model. The proof-of-concept framework established here can be readily applied to investigate the impact of assorted organ-level ventilation strategies on local pulmonary force and strain distributions, and to further explore how diseased states may alter the load-bearing material behavior of the lung.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) refers to the property of certain atomic nuclei to absorb the energy of radio waves under a corresponding magnetic field. NMR forms the basis for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and, in a low-intensity form, for NMR therapy (tNMR). Since the circadian clock is bi-directionally intertwined with hypoxic signaling in vertebrates and mammals, we hypothesized that low intensity electromagnetic fields, such as tNMR, might not only affect circadian clocks but also Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;). As master regulator of the hypoxic signaling pathway, HIF-1&#945; is known to dampen the circadian amplitude under reduced oxygen availability, while the hypoxic response of cells and organisms, itself, is tightly clock controlled. In a first experiment, we investigated if tNMR is able to act as Zeitgeber for the core clock mechanism of unsynchronized zebrafish and mouse fibroblast cells, using direct light irradiation and treatment with the glucocorticoid Dexamethasone as references. tNMR significantly affected the cell autonomous clocks of unsynchronized mouse fibroblast cells NIH3-T3, but did not act as a Zeitgeber. Similar to light irradiation and in contrast to treatment with Dexamethasone, tNMR did not synchronize expression profiles of murine clock genes. However, irradiation with tNMR as well as light significantly altered mRNA and protein expression levels of Cryptochrome1, Cryptochrome2 and Clock1 for more than 24 h. Changes in mRNA and protein after different treatment durations, namely 6 and 12 h, appeared to be nonlinear. A nonlinear dose-response relationship is known as hallmark of electromagnetic field induced effects on biological systems. The most prominent alterations were detected in murine HIF-1&#945; protein, again in a nonlinear dose-response. In contrast to murine cells, zebrafish fibroblasts did not respond to tNMR at all. Light, a potent Zeitgeber for the peripheral clocks of fish, led to the expected synchronized clock gene oscillations of high amplitude, as did Dexamethasone. Hence, we conclude, mammalian peripheral clocks are more susceptible to tNMR than the direct light entrainable fish fibroblasts. Although light and tNMR did not act as Zeitgebers for the circadian clocks of unsynchronized murine cells, the significant observed effects might indicate downstream cell-physiological ramifications, which are worth future investigation. However, beside the effects tNMR exerts on the core clock mechanism of mammalian cells, the technology might be the first non-pharmacological approach to modify HIF-1&#945; protein in cells and tissues. HIF-1&#945; and the associated circadian clock play key roles in diseases with underlying ischemic background, such as infarct, stroke, and cancer and, also infectious diseases, such as Covid-19. Hence, low intensity magnetic fields such as tNMR might be of significant medical interest.","output":"Therapeutic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance affects the core clock mechanism and associated Hypoxia-inducible factor-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003402.].","output":"Correction: Variation in racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality by age in the United States: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we analyze the management of the global coronavirus pandemic with a critical focus on global neoliberalism and from the perspective of Latin America As we argue, after decades of austerity programs and multiple rounds of macroeconomic crises, many lessons can be gleaned as to how global neoliberalism operates In order to make sense of the global response to the pandemic and how it has been presented to the public, we not only draw on almost a half century of economic historyLatin American and otherwisebut also on the theoretical framework established by Karl and Kari Polanyi As we argue, the pandemic response can be best understood as the most recent example of Disaster Capitalism, with the underlying goal of strengthening and expanding the reach of the global neoliberal project, and neutralizing any response to it","output":"The Crossroads: The Political Economy of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the brief experience of the Nephrology Center located in a \\"no-COVID\\" Hospital in Massa Marittima We describe the actions taken to prevent the transmission of the virus SARS-CoV-2 among hemodialysis patients and healthcare workers and the methods for diagnosing COVID-19, with particular attention to serological tests and nasopharyngeal swabs in asymptomatic subjects The detection of IgM and IgG antibodies through the serological test performed on 34 patients, all negative for nasopharyngeal swabs, showed positivity in 41,18% of cases These have been classified as false positives following repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs, the evaluation of clinical and epidemiological history and of clinical manifestations and, finally, a second serological test performed after 18 days, which resulted negative for all patients Interpreting serological tests is not easy;the strategies for diagnosis should include clinical and epidemiological history and clinical manifestations, as well as the results of confirmation tests and the evaluation over a precise observation period Otherwise, there is a risk of considering as protected by antibodies subjects that are in fact false positives","output":"[Efficacy of serological tests for COVID-19 in asymptomatic HD patients: the experience of an Italian hemodialysis unit]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To explore perspectives of Mesothelioma UK clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) on their role in providing palliative care for patients with mesothelioma and their families. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive approach using focus group and interview methods. METHODS: Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 Mesothelioma UK clinical nurse specialists using the online software Google Meet. Data collection was carried out in Jan-Feb 2021 and data were analysed using thematic analysis. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) was used as the reporting guideline for this paper. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified from the data: Mesothelioma UK clinical nurse specialist role in relation to palliative care; joint working with specialist palliative care and community services; patients and family carer's willingness to engage with palliative care services; and the impact of COVID-19 on palliative care for mesothelioma patients. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights into palliative care needs in mesothelioma. Patients with mesothelioma and their families have significant palliative care needs throughout the course of their illness from diagnosis to the end of life. Mesothelioma UK CNS's play a crucial role in supporting patients' and families palliative care needs, and are highly skilled in providing this care. IMPACT: By acknowledging the role of Mesothelioma UK CNS's in palliative care provision, and supporting collaborative working between specialist and generalist palliative care providers, there is the capacity to significantly improve palliative care in mesothelioma and improve outcomes for patients and their families.","output":"Clinical nurse specialist role in providing generalist and specialist palliative care: A qualitative study of mesothelioma clinical nurse specialists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The standard measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV) is restricted by the need for simultaneous tonometry measurements requiring two technicians and expensive equipment, limiting this technique to well-resourced settings. In this preliminary study, we compared a simplified method of pulse wave detection from the finger and toe to pulse wave detection from the carotid and radial arteries using applanation tonometry in children and young adults. We hypothesized that the simplified method of PWV measurement would strongly correlate with the standard measurement in different age groups and oxygen conditions. Participants included (a) boys and girls aged 8-12 years and (b) men and women aged 18-40 years. Participants rested supine while carotid and radial artery pulse waves were measured using applanation tonometry and finger and toe pulse waves were simultaneously collected using a Finometer Midi and a piezo-electric pulse transducer, respectively. These measurements were repeated under hypoxic conditions. Finger-toe PWV measurements were strongly correlated to carotid-radial PWV in adults (R=0.58; P=0.011), but not in children (R=0.056; P=0.610). Finger-toe PWV was sensitive enough to show increases in PWV with age (P<0.0001) and hypoxia in children (P<0.0001) and adults (P=0.003). These results indicate that the simplified measurement of finger-toe PWV strongly correlates with the standard measurement of carotid-radial PWV in adults, but not in children. However, finger-toe PWV can be used in either population to determine changes with hypoxia.","output":"A simplified measurement of pulse wave velocity is not inferior to standard measurement in young adults and children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This analysis focuses on the lockdown measures in the context of the Covid-19 crisis in Spring 2020 in Germany.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students in different geographical areas of China during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese college students of 16 provinces or municipalities from February 4 to 12, 2020. A web-based survey was adopted to collect information from these college students, including demographics, perceived risk of infection, attitudes toward the epidemic and its control, and mental health status. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the percentage of perceived risk of infection and attitude toward COVID-19 among college students in different geographic locations. Binary logistic models were used to identify associations between geographic locations and mental health problems after controlling for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 11,787 participants were analyzed in this study (response rate: 79.7%). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students was 17.8% (95% CI 17.1%-18.5%) and 25.9% (95% CI 25.1%-26.7%), respectively. After controlling for covariates, current residence area in Wuhan city was found to have a positive association with anxiety symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.68) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.59). Similarly, college location in Wuhan city was found to have a positive association with anxiety symptoms (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.35) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.36). History of residence in or travel to Wuhan city in the past month was also positively associated with anxiety symptoms (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.46-1.80) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.35-1.63). Furthermore, the perceived risk of COVID-19 was higher among students whose college location and current residence area were in Wuhan city, and it was positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health problems among Chinese college students were widespread and geographically diverse.

The most common indication for APM is a degenerative meniscal tear (DMT). High-quality evidence suggests that APM does not provide meaningful benefits in patients with DMTs and may even be harmful in the longer term. This narrative review focuses on a fundamental question: considering the history and large number of these surgeries, has APM ever actually worked in patients with DMT? A truly effective treatment needs a valid disease model that would biologically and plausibly explain the perceived treatment benefits. In the case of DMT, effectiveness requires a credible framework for the pain-generating process, which should be influenced by APM. Basic research, pathoanatomy, and clinical evidence gives no support to these frameworks. Moreover, treatment of DMT with an APM does not align with the traditional practice of medicine since DMT is not a reliable diagnosis for knee pain and no evidence-based indication exists that would influence patient prognosis from APM. A plausible and robust explanation supported by both basic research and clinical evidence is that DMTs are part of an osteoarthritic disease process and do not contribute to the symptoms independently or in isolation and that symptoms are not treatable with APM. This is further supported by the fact that APM as an intervention is paradoxical because the extent of procedure and severity of disease are both inversely associated with outcome. We argue that arthroscopic treatment of DMT is largely based on a logical fallacy: post hoc ergo propter hoc.","output":"Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy: did it ever work?: A narrative review from basic research to proposed disease framework and science of clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fabry Disease (FD) is a systemic disorder that can result in cardiovascular, renal, and neurovascular disease leading to reduced life expectancy. FD should be considered in the differential of all patients with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We therefore performed a prospective screening study in Edmonton and Hong Kong using Dried Blood Spot (DBS) testing on patients with undiagnosed LVH. Participants found to have unexplained LVH on echocardiography were invited to participate and subsequently subjected to DBS testing. DBS testing was used to measure -galactosidase (-GAL) enzyme activity and for mutation analysis of the -galactosidase (GLA) gene, both of which are required to make a diagnosis of FD. DBS testing was performed as a screening tool on patients (n = 266) in Edmonton and Hong Kong, allowing for detection of five patients with FD (2% prevalence of FD) and one patient with hydroxychloroquine-induced phenocopy. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) by GLA genotype showed a higher LVMI in patients with IVS4 + 919G > A mutations compared to those without the mutation. Two patients were initiated on ERT and hydroxychloroquine was discontinued in the patient with a phenocopy of FD. Overall, we detected FD in 2% of our screening cohort using DBS testing as an effective and easy to administer screening tool in patients with unexplained LVH. Utilizing DBS testing to screen for FD in patients with otherwise undiagnosed LVH is clinically important due to the availability of effective therapies and the value of cascade screening in extended families.","output":"Screening for Fabry Disease in patients with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Brazil, indigenous peoples present a complex reality characterized by a marked social vulnerability that is manifested in health and nutritional indicators In this scenario, poor sanitary conditions prevail, with a high burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases;infectious/parasitic diseases;and nutritional disorders, including malnutrition and anemia This situation is reflected in numerous aspects of food insecurity, placing this population in a position of particular vulnerability to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and its effects The objective of our study was to present a set of preliminary reflections on food insecurity and indigenous protagonism in times of Covid-19 The pandemic has deepened the inequalities that affect the indigenous peoples, with a direct impact on food security conditions Amid the effects of the pandemic, indigenous protagonism has played a fundamental role in guaranteeing these peoples' rights and access to food, denouncing the absent and slow official responses as acts of institutional violence, which will have serious and lasting effects on the lives of indigenous peoples","output":"Indigenous protagonism in the context of food insecurity in times of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter traces a historical account of transfer of technologies from the West to the African countries by extrapolating the cultural differences and presenting a critical cultural approach to evaluating and choosing congruent technologies for each region.

Work in this area has continued to expand over the past two decades along with broader establishment of the field of early modern women's writing. Shifting away from biographically centered analyses, recent scholarship has demonstrated the formal and stylistic innovation, rich intertextuality, and material history of Pembroke's writings, as well as Pembroke's literary influence and the creative significance of her editorial work. Pembroke's writings also foreground important issues related to form, genre, and textual transmission in the early modern context, including musical performance. The essay concludes by outlining some areas for further work. Pembroke's engagement with transnational networks warrants further exploration, as does the question of how Pembroke scholarship might further contribute to field-changing conversations about race in premodern studies. Digital scholarship has the potential to further illuminate the complex circulation and reception history of Pembroke's writings;future scholarly and pedagogical work on Pembroke will likely also be shaped by online tools and modalities expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies that have demonstrated how Pembroke's writings complicate established categories of gender, form, and authorial and editorial practice are also opening up important avenues for further study in relation to book history, the new formalism, and gender and queer studies.

Supporting their psychological wellbeing continues, therefore, to be a priority. This rapid review was carried out to establish whether there are any identifiable risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes amongst HSCWs during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: We undertook a rapid review of the literature following guidelines by the WHO and the Cochrane Collaborations recommendations. We searched across 14 databases, executing the search at two different time points. We included published, observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects on HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The 24 studies included in this review reported data predominantly from China (18 out of 24 included studies) and most sampled urban hospital staff. Our study indicates that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of front-line hospital staff. Results suggest that nurses may be at higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic, but no studies compare this group with the primary care workforce. Furthermore, no studies investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social care staff. Other risk factors identified were underlying organic illness, gender (female), concern about family, fear of infection, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and close contact with COVID-19. Systemic support, adequate knowledge and resilience were identified as factors protecting against adverse mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence to date suggests that female nurses with close contact with COVID-19 patients may have the most to gain from efforts aimed at supporting psychological well-being. However, inconsistencies in findings and a lack of data collected outside of hospital settings, suggest that we should not exclude any groups when addressing psychological well-being in health and social care workers. Whilst psychological interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in the individual may be of benefit, it is evident that to build a resilient workforce, occupational and environmental factors must be addressed. Further research including social care workers and analysis of wider societal structural factors is recommended.

Motivated by applied state-level opioid policy evaluations, this simulation study compares statistical performance of multiple variations of two-way fixed effect models traditionally used for DID under a range of simulation conditions. While most linear models resulted in minimal bias, non-linear models and population-weighted versions of classic linear two-way fixed effect and linear GEE models yielded considerable bias (60 to 160%). Further, root mean square error is minimized by linear AR models when examining crude mortality rates and by negative binomial models when examining raw death counts. In the context of frequentist hypothesis testing, many models yielded high Type I error rates and very low rates of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (<10%), raising concerns of spurious conclusions about policy effectiveness. When considering performance across models, the linear autoregressive models were optimal in terms of directional bias, root mean squared error, Type I error, and correct rejection rates. These findings highlight notable limitations of traditional statistical models commonly used for DID designs, designs widely used in opioid policy studies and in state policy evaluations more broadly.","output":"Moving beyond the classic difference-in-differences model: A simulation study comparing statistical methods for estimating effectiveness of state-level policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The anterior segment of the eye is a complex set of structures that collectively act to maintain the integrity of the globe and direct light towards the posteriorly located retina. The eye is exposed to numerous physical and environmental insults such as infection, UV radiation, physical or chemical injuries. Loss of transparency to the cornea or lens (cataract) and dysfunctional regulation of intra ocular pressure (glaucoma) are leading causes of worldwide blindness. Whilst traditional therapeutic approaches can improve vision, their effect often fails to control the multiple pathological events that lead to long-term vision loss. Regenerative medicine approaches in the eye have already had success with ocular stem cell therapy and ex vivo production of cornea and conjunctival tissue for transplant recovering patients vision. However, advancements are required to increase the efficacy of these as well as develop other ocular cell therapies. One of the most important challenges that determines the success of regenerative approaches is the preservation of the stem cell properties during expansion culture in vitro. To achieve this, the environment must provide the physical, chemical and biological factors that ensure the maintenance of their undifferentiated state, as well as their proliferative capacity. This is likely to be accomplished by replicating the natural stem cell niche in vitro. Due to the complex nature of the cell microenvironment, the creation of such artificial niches requires the use of bioengineering techniques which can replicate the physico-chemical properties and the dynamic cellCextracellular matrix interactions that maintain the stem cell phenotype.

The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among nurses providing care to the COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from 10th April 2021 to 30th June 2021 among 301 nurses from three COVID-19 dedicated hospitals using self-administered questionnaires. Whole sampling technique was used. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of Nepal Health Research Council (Registration number: 106/2021P). The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16. Descriptive statistics like frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation were calculated. RESULTS: Out of 301 nurses, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 258 (85.72%), 189 (62.80%) and 151 (49.84%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study has shown a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among nurses in comparison to other studies in the similar settings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients treated by laparoscopic liver resections of left lateral segments were included. Controls were a group of 14 patients undergoing open resection for similar pathology. Primary outcomes were costs. Secondary outcomes were complications, conversions, blood loss, length of operation, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The laparoscopic approach for hepatic left lateral resection (bisegmentectomy 2 and 3) was performed in fourteen patients (group I, median age 54 [range 26-82] years). In the open group, fourteen patients from a prospectively collected database with the same type of resection were selected (group II, median age 64 [range 29-76] years). Costs of theatre usage in the laparoscopic group were significantly lower (p=0.031). No significant differences in costs of disposable instruments, ward stay and total costs were observed between the two groups. There were three complications in the laparoscopic group compared with two complications in the open group. In the laparoscopic group there were 2 conversions (14%). Median blood loss was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (50 mls [range 0-750], (p=0.001) versus the open group (500 mls [range 150-750]). Furthermore, operation time was also significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (116 [range 85-261] minutes) versus the open group (165 [range 96-217] minutes, p=0.016). Median length of stay was 6 [range 4-11] days in group I versus 6 [range 5-13] days in group II (p=0.508). CONCLUSION Costs of laparoscopic liver resections proved to be equivalent to open surgery. Furthermore, implementation of a laparoscopic liver resection programme seems feasible and safe with reduced blood loss and operation time and comparable morbidity and length of stay.","output":"The introduction of a laparoscopic liver surgery programme: a cost analysis of initial experience in a university hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) is a devastating complication of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and is often associated with cardiogenic shock.

The addition of plication of the stomach to LAGB should provide better appetite control, more effective weight loss, and greater weight loss potential. The purpose of the study was to analyze the outcomes of LAGBP at 18 months. METHODS Data from all patients who underwent a primary LAGBP procedure from December 2011 through June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected from each patient included age, gender, weight, body mass index (BMI), and excess weight loss (EWL). RESULTS Sixty-six patients underwent LAGBP. The mean age and BMI were 44.6  12.7 years and 42.1  5.1 kg/m2, respectively. The patients lost an average of 49% and 46.8% EWL at 12 months (77.2% follow-up) and 18 months (66.1% follow-up), respectively. The mean band adjustments were 2.1  1.7 (range, 0-7) per patient in 1 year. The mean additional adjustment volume (infusion and withdrawal of saline) was 0.6  1 cc. Dysphagia was the most common long-term complication. The band removal rate was 7.5%. The mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSIONS LAGBP is a relatively safe and effective bariatric procedure. In light of recent studies demonstrating poor outcomes following LAGB, LAGBP may prove to be the future for patients desiring a bariatric procedure without resection of the stomach.","output":"Weight Loss Outcomes of Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Band with Plication: a Single Center Experience of 66 Patients with 18-Month Follow-Up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical decision support tools rooted in machine learning and optimization can provide significant value to healthcare providers, including through better management of intensive care units. In particular, it is important that the patient discharge task addresses the nuanced trade-off between decreasing a patient's length of stay (and associated hospitalization costs) and the risk of readmission or even death following the discharge decision. This work introduces an end-to-end general framework for capturing this trade-off to recommend optimal discharge timing decisions given a patient's electronic health records. A data-driven approach is used to derive a parsimonious, discrete state space representation that captures a patient's physiological condition. Based on this model and a given cost function, an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process is formulated and solved numerically to compute an optimal discharge policy, whose value is assessed using off-policy evaluation strategies.

Systematic review and meta-analysis. Fifteen studies with a total of 775 participants were included. Twelve studies were of high quality and three studies were of moderate quality using the modified Black and Downs checklist. There was no between group difference in AHD in neutral shoulder position (mean difference [95% CI] 0.28 [-0.13 to 0.69] mm), shoulder abduction at 45 (-0.02 [-0.99 to 0.96] mm) or 60 (-0.20 [-0.61 to 0.20] mm).

Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical assessment tools that best predict mortality risk following hip fracture for patients with CKD. METHODS: Patients with CKD G3b-5D admitted to Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, U.K. between June 2013 and Dec 2019 were included. The association between CKD and post-fracture mortality risk was evaluated. All patients were assessed using tools that evaluated frailty status, co-morbidity, pre-operative risk, functional status and cardiopulmonary fitness. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine the prognostic accuracy of the assessment tools for 30 day and 1 year mortality following hip fracture in patients with CKD. RESULTS: 397 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria with a mean age of 83.5  9.2 years. Older age, female sex, intracapsular fracture and more severe CKD, co-morbidity and frailty status were all associated with an increased mortality risk. Patients with dialysis-dependent CKD and severe/very severe frailty had a hazard ratio for mortality of 2.55 (95% Cl 2.11C2.98) and 3.11 (95% Cl 2.47C3.93), respectively.

Most governments chose to implement precautionary measures, e.g., physical distancing and use of protective devices, which can in part limit the transmission of the virus. However, the healthcare system experienced numerous structural problems in managing the Covid-19 patients given the limited human and technical resources in critical areas, such as the intensive care units (ICUs). Different therapeutic solutions should therefore be assessed, which can potentially minimize the negative impact of the disease on patients, favoring their recovery and optimizing healthcare resources. The objective of this study is to simulate the impact of remdesivir treatment on the pandemic course in the long term. METHODS: A forecasting model is designed to estimate how remdesivir would impact the ICU capacity and the healthcare costs from the hospital perspective when managing COVID-19 patients. This model is applied in the Portuguese context with a 20-week projection starting on May 1st and concluding on September 18th, 2021. The data inputs were carefully collected by consulting different sources, such as published global literature, official governmental reports, and available infectious diseases databases, i.e., Our World in Data, Portuguese Ministry of Health, and experts opinions. RESULTS: The model showed that the introduction of remdesivir-based treatment in patients with Covid-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy generates a significant reduction in both the number of ICU admissions and deaths, which would produce more than 23 million in cost savings and avoid more than 261 ICUs admissions and 166 deaths. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that alternative treatments such as remdesivir can reduce both the health burden for healthcare facilities, optimize their management, and improve patients clinical conditions. However, the model is centered on Rt values, which cannot be generalized to the entire country; hence, the results of this research should be considered as a hypothetical study.

RESULTS: One hundred thirty of 249 (52.2%) symptomatic HCWs had COVID-19; 10 were hospitalized but none died. Of 987 asymptomatic HCWs,37 (3.7%) were AC; 6 of the remaining 950 asymptomatic HCWs with a negative PCR test result were found to be presymptomatic COVID-19 cases the following 14 days. Nurses were more frequently present in the COVID-19 group (51.5% vs. 37.0%), but multivariable analysis rendered non-significant results. After adjustment for age, comorbidities, and working place, factors found to be associated with AC were: working in wards as a nurse (aOR = 9.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-80.22, p = 0.045), kitchen personnel (aOR = 4.09, 95% CI = 1.55-10.83, p = 0.005), and being a physician (aOR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.54, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: HCW category was the predominant factor associated with AC of SARS-CoV-2 in this study.","output":"Factors Associated with COVID-19 and Asymptomatic Carriage in Healthcare Workers of a COVID-19 Hospital"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/38.md","filePath":"consultation/38.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/38.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
