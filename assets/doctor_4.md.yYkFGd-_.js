In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the impact on mental health among different age groups due to social isolation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: : We conducted a carefully designed cross sectional survey on mental health that was disseminated widely by way of email, personal contact and social media to subjects aged between 11 and >70 years. For our analysis we stratified data into three distinct groups: children/young adults (11-40), middle age (40-60) and older adult age (> 60) groups. 3214 respondents answered the survey. Bonferroni corrected Chi-square tests were used to find significant relationships between the demographic groups and mental health related variables. Results: : We observed a high percentage of insomnia (79%) in old age respondants compared to children/young adults (61%) and middle age (66%) groups, suggesting that age is significantly associated (p= 3.8 X 10 -06 ;odds ratio (OR) = 2.34) with insomnia. Respondents who were retired also reported a higher prevalence (73%) of insomnia (p = 2.79 X 10 -8 ) compare to employed individuals. A higher level of mental stress (84%) was observed in middle aged respondents followed by old adult (71%) respondents (p=0.001). Significantly higher rates (p = 5.08 X 10 -27 ;OR = 2.06) of mental stress were detected in people with preexisting comorbidities compared with the healthy group. The old age participants were less familiar with the concept of social isolation and 54% of old age participants had a negative perception towards social isolation compared to children/young adults (12%) and middle-aged (7%) respondents. Conclusion: Our results indicate an association between age and mental stress concomitant on the COVID-19 social isolation policy in Bangladesh. Social isolation increased insomnia and mental stress, particularly in old age and middle age group. Moreover, these older age groups also tended to have a negative perception of the COVID-19 isolation policy. Therefore, providing mental healthcare services and policy related education in developing countries should target these older age groups to ensure maintenance of their mental wellbeing and adherence to safe practice.","output":"Impact of Social Isolation on Mental Health Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein structures are crucial for understanding their biological activities. Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions from our in-house structure prediction pipeline. The pipeline takes advantage of inter-residue contact predictions from trRosetta, a machine learning-based method. The predicted models were further improved by applying molecular dynamics simulation-based refinement. We also took the AlphaFold models and refined them by applying the same refinement method.

The effectivity of vitamin D as a therapeutic intervention in critical illness remains less defined. The current study analyzed clinical and immunologic effects of vitamin D levels in patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients receiving intensive care with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ARDS. 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D serum levels, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell subsets were measured on admission as well as after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters were extracted from the patient data management system. Standard operating procedures included the daily administration of vitamin D3 via enteral feeding. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were eligible, of which 26 were included in this study as data on vitamin D status was available. 96% suffered from severe COVID-19 ARDS. All patients without prior vitamin D supplementation (n = 22) had deficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D but not did not increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters did not differ between patients with sufficient or deficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Only circulating plasmablasts were higher in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &#8805;30 ng/ml (p = 0.029). Patients with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 pg/ml required longer mechanical ventilation (p = 0.045) and had a worse acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (p = 0.048).

This commentary reviews relevant findings and discusses scientific evidence on the risks of worse clinical and psychiatric complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 in subjects who use cannabis. Although they are not included as a risk group in the health recommendations for that disease, they may have a more vulnerable respiratory system to viral diseases. There are certain similarities between the harmful cardiovascular and respiratory effects of cannabis use and those of smoking. Due to the different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for longe and may also contain other toxic substances such as tar, a substance found in tobacco and which has been associated with the development of lung cancer, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema.

While CoVs are poor inducers of type I IFNs in tissue culture, several studies have demonstrated the importance of the type I IFN response in controlling MHV infection in animals. The protective effectors against MHV infection are, however, still unknown. RESULTS: In order to get more insight into the antiviral gene expression induced in the brains of MHV-infected mice, we performed whole-genome expression profiling. Three different mouse strains, differing in their susceptibility to infection with MHV, were used. In BALB/c mice, which display high viral loads but are able to control the infection, 57 and 121 genes were significantly differentially expressed ( 1.5 fold change) upon infection at 2 and 5 days post infection, respectively. Functional association network analyses demonstrated a strong type I IFN response, with Irf1 and Irf7 as the central players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent. Both the type I and II IFN response, which were more pronounced in mice with a higher viral load, were not observed in 129SvEv mice, which are much less susceptible to infection with MHV. 129SvEv mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-/-), however, were not able to control the infection. Gene expression profiling of these mice identified type I IFN-independent responses to infection, with IFN- as the central player. As the BALB/c and the IFNAR-/- 129SvEv mice demonstrated very similar viral loads in their brains, we also compared their gene expression profiles upon infection with MHV in order to identify type I IFN-dependent transcriptional responses. Many known IFN-inducible genes were detected, several of which have previously been shown to play an important protective role against virus infections. We speculate that the additional type I IFN-dependent genes that we discovered may also be important for protection against MHV infection. CONCLUSION: Transcriptional profiling of mice infected with MHV demonstrated the induction of a robust IFN response, which correlated with the viral load. Profiling of IFNAR-/- mice allowed us to identify type I IFN-independent and -dependent responses. Overall, this study broadens our present knowledge of the type I and II IFN-mediated effector responses during CoV infection in vivo.","output":"Type I interferon receptor-independent and -dependent host transcriptional responses to mouse hepatitis coronavirus infection in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: With the rise in COVID-19 cases, the Eye Bank of Canada (Ontario Division), the largest eye bank in Canada, was faced with challenges related to ocular donor suitability which resulted in tissue shortages after the first wave of COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada. This article aims to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on ocular tissue donation and transplant surgeries. METHODS: Trends in ocular donations in 2020 and the transplant rates were compared with the data from the previous year, as a benchmark of normal eye bank activity. RESULTS: Ocular donor volumes decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) by 65% as compared to the same period in 2019. By the end of the year 2020, this had resulted in a total reduction of 29% of ocular donor volumes as compared to 2019. The ocular transplant surgery volumes in the year 2020 decreased by 32% compared to the previous year, mostly secondary to elective surgery shutdown during the first wave. Because of tissue shortages, the Eye Bank of Canada (Ontario Division) had to import 24 corneas from the United States and cancel 7 surgeries in the year 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The decline in ocular tissue donor volumes and transplant surgery was a result of an interplay of causes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most importantly, ruling out of COVID-19 carriers, lockdown measures affecting tissue retrieval processes, and shutdown of elective surgery were the 3 major factors accounting for tissue shortages and surgical volume reductions.","output":"The Effect of COVID-19 on Corneal Donor Volumes and Eye Bank Processes: An Analysis From the Eye Bank of Canada (Ontario Division)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Experimental knowledge about mesh behavior at the esophageal hiatus is rare, but such information is essential in order to find a safe and effective method of mesh reinforcement. This study aimed to investigate the influence of mesh structure on the biological behavior of polypropylene prostheses placed at the hiatus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four pigs in three groups of eight underwent implantation of heavyweight small-porous (HW-SP), heavyweight large-porous (HW-LP), or lightweight large-porous (LW-LP) circular polypropylene mesh at the hiatus. Eight weeks later, the meshes were explanted. Macroscopic analysis was performed evaluating mesh deformation, adhesions, and position relative to the hiatal margin. Histological analysis comprised evaluation of foreign body reaction and tissue integration by mononuclear cell count and immunostaining of Ki-67, collagen type I, and collagen type III. RESULTS No mesh-related complications occurred. Mesh shrinkage was observed within all groups and was the lowest for HW-LP, higher for HW-SP, and highest for LW-LP (13.8% versus 19.5% versus 25.5%; P<.001). The adhesion score was highest for HW-SP, lower for HW-LP, and lowest for LW-LP (11.0 versus 8.0 versus 6.0; P<.001). The collagen type I/III ratio was higher for HW-SP compared with HW-LP and LW-LP (3.1 versus 2.2 versus 1.8; P=.014). CONCLUSIONS Heavyweight polypropylene meshes may be advantageous for application at the hiatus. They provide a solid fixation of the esophagogastric junction by adhesions, which may contribute to a reduction of hernia recurrence. In heavyweight meshes, the large-porous structure is associated with superior form stability, and small-porous meshes are superior with regard to solidity of tissue integration, which may prevent mesh migration.","output":"Influence of weight and structure on biological behavior of polypropylene mesh prostheses placed at the esophageal hiatus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 rapidly emerged as a crippling public health crisis in the last few months, which has presented a series health risk.

An educational program was then completed that involved training our anesthesia providers about complications related to excessive cuff pressure and how to utilize a quantitative cuff pressure measurement device (manometer). The impact of this educational initiative was assessed by comparing the incidence of postoperative complications associated with the use of airway devices before and after the training period. METHODS After approval by our institution's Institutional Review Board, a pre-intervention (baseline) survey was obtained from 259 adult patients after having undergone surgery with general anesthesia with the use of an endotracheal tube (ETT) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Survey responses were used to determine the baseline incidence of sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Once these results were obtained, education was provided to the anesthesia department members addressing the complications associated with excessive cuff pressures, appropriate cuff pressures based on manufacturer recommendations, and instructions on the use of a quantitative monitor to determine cuff pressure (manometry). Clinical care was then changed by requiring intraoperative cuff pressure monitoring throughout our institution for all surgical patients. After this educational period, 299 patients completed the same survey describing postoperative airway complications. RESULTS The use of manometry reduced the incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative sore throat in the pre- vs. post-intervention groups (35 patients vs 31 patients, p = 0.045), moderate to severe hoarseness (30 patients vs 13, patients p = 0.0001), and moderate-to-severe dysphagia (13 patients vs 5 patients, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Caring for patients in the perioperative setting frequently entails placement of an airway device.

These actions were not coordinated at the national level, which raises the question of what might have happened if they were. It also creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure their effect with greater accuracy. Methods We combine publicly available data sources on the timing of stay-at-home orders and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases at the county level in the United States (N = 132,048). We then derive from the classic SIR model a two-way fixed-effects model and apply it to the data with controls for unmeasured differences between counties and over time. This enables us to estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders while accounting for local variation in factors like health systems and demographics, and temporal variation in national mitigation actions, access to tests, or exposure to media reports that could influence the course of the disease. Findings Mean county-level daily growth in COVID-19 infections peaked at 17.2% just before stay-at-home orders were issued. Two way fixed-effects regression estimates suggest that orders were associated with a 3.8 percentage point (95% CI 0.7 to 8.6) reduction in the growth rate after one week and an 8.6 percentage point (3.0 to 14.1) reduction after two weeks. By day 22 the reduction (18.2 percentage points, 12.3 to 24.0) had surpassed the growth at the peak, indicating that growth had turned negative and the number of new daily infections was beginning to decline. A hypothetical national stay-at-home order issued on March 13, 2020 when a national emergency was declared might have reduced cumulative county infections by 62.3%, and might have helped to reverse exponential growth in the disease by April 5. Interpretation Although stay-at-home orders impose great costs to society, delayed responses and piecemeal application of these orders generate similar costs without obtaining the full potential benefits suggested by this analysis. The results here suggest that a coordinated nationwide stay-at-home order may have reduced by hundreds of thousands the current number of infections and by thousands the total number of deaths from COVID-19. Future efforts in the United States and elsewhere to control pandemics should coordinate stay-at-home orders at the national level, especially for diseases for which local spread has already occurred and testing availability is delayed. Since stay-at-home orders reduce infection growth rates, early implementation when infection counts are still low would be most beneficial.","output":"The Effect of Stay-at-Home Orders on COVID-19 Infections in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study is to explore how international faculty at Japanese universities view their integration.

The aim of this study was to identify new markers of CCx across different species and tumour entities. METHODS: Quantitative secretome analysis was performed to identify specific factors characteristic of cachexia\\\\inducing cancer cell lines. To establish the subsequently identified phospholipase PLA2G7 as a marker of CCx, plasma PLA2G7 activity and/or protein levels were measured in well\\\\established mouse models of CCx and in different cohorts of weight\\\\stable and weight\\\\losing cancer patients with different tumour entities. Genetic PLA2G7 knock\\\\down in tumours and pharmacological treatment using the well\\\\studied PLA2G7 inhibitor darapladib were performed to assess its implication in the pathogenesis of CCx in C26 tumour\\\\bearing mice. RESULTS: High expression and secretion of PLA2G7 were hallmarks of cachexia\\\\inducing cancer cell lines. Circulating PLA2G7 activity was increased in different mouse models of CCx with various tumour entities and was associated with the severity of body wasting. Circulating PLA2G7 levels gradually rose during cachexia development. Genetic PLA2G7 knock\\\\down in C26 tumours only partially reduced plasma PLA2G7 levels, suggesting that the host is also an important contributor. Chronic treatment with darapladib was not sufficient to counteract inflammation and tissue wasting despite a strong inhibition of the circulating PLA2G7 activity.

Also, to our knowledge, the development of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been previously reported in this population. Although serologic testing does not provide information on the infectivity of patients, seroprevalence studies may enable investigation of exposure within dialysis units and hence, assessment of current screening strategies. METHODS To investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a hemodialysis population, we used the Abbott IgG assay with the Architect system to test serum samples from 356 patients receiving in-center hemodialysis for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS Of 356 patients, 121 had been symptomatic when screened before a dialysis session and received an RT-PCR test; 79 (22.2% of the total study population) tested positive for COVID-19.

We discuss three case studies of engagement activities to draw out potential uses of source materials and the responses of different audiences to these materials, and reflect on what we have learnt since embarking on these public engagement activities. We took into our interactions with different audiences the belief that fully historicised understandings of 'health' enrich individual lives and create new capacities for meaningful action now. The public engagement activities we carried out reinforced this belief, but also caused us to question some of our assumptions.

Early in outbreaks, evidence is scarce, but it accumulates rapidly. We are continuously facing new disease outbreaks, including the new coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) in December 2019.The objective of this study was to describe the accumulation of evidence during the 2013-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Pacific and the Americas related to aetiological causal questions about congenital abnormalities and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Methods: We hypothesised that the temporal sequence would follow a pre-specified order, according to study design. We assessed 1) how long it takes before findings from a specific study design appear, 2) how publication of preprints could reduce the time to publication and 3) how time to publication evolves over time. Results: We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019. In the 2013-2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports, case series and basic research studies were published first. Case-control and cohort studies appeared between 400-700 days after ZIKV was first detected in the region of the study origin. Delay due to the publication process were lowest at the beginning of the outbreak. Only 4.6% of the publications was available as preprints. Discussion: The accumulation of evidence over time in new causal problems generally followed a hierarchy. Preprints reduced the delay to initial publication.

This study aimed to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of trust in government regarding COVID-19 control with the adoption of recommended health behaviours and prosocial behaviours, and potential determinants of trust in government during the pandemic. METHODS: This study analysed data from the PsyCorona Survey, an international project on COVID-19 that included 23 733 participants from 23 countries (representative in age and gender distributions by country) at baseline survey and 7785 participants who also completed follow-up surveys. Specification curve analysis was used to examine concurrent associations between trust in government and self-reported behaviours. We further used structural equation model to explore potential determinants of trust in government. Multilevel linear regressions were used to examine associations between baseline trust and longitudinal behavioural changes. RESULTS: Higher trust in government regarding COVID-19 control was significantly associated with higher adoption of health behaviours (handwashing, avoiding crowded space, self-quarantine) and prosocial behaviours in specification curve analyses (median standardised ? = 0.173 and 0.229, p < 0.001). Government perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in government (standardised ? = 0.358, 0.230, 0.056, and 0.249, p < 0.01). Higher trust at baseline survey was significantly associated with lower rate of decline in health behaviours over time (p for interaction = 0.001).

Our study compares outcomes for cancer patients matched to non-cancer patients between the two waves in order to explore further how cancer and its treatment may impact COVID-19 mortality. Methods: Data was collected for patients with positive PCR and history of cancer between 1 Mar to 20 May 2020 and 1 Dec to 8 Feb 2021 for wave 1 and 2, respectively. A contemporaneous cohort of patients without cancer were age- and sex-matched for comparison. Results: The total number of patients presenting with COVID-19 was higher in wave two (1135 vs 626). 207 of these patients had cancer, and were matched to 452 patients without cancer from both waves. There was a significantly improved chance of mortality in wave 2 (HR 0.41, p < 0.0001). When adjusting for age, sex and co-morbidities, cancer was an independent risk factor for mortality amongst patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in wave 1 (HR 1.62, p = 0.02), but not in wave 2. There was a trend towards improved survival for hospitalised patients in wave 2 receiving COVID-19 specific treatment including dexamethasone, remdesivir, tocilizumab (HR 0.75, p = 0.086). For the combined cancer cohort, SACT was an independent predictor of mortality, as was metastatic disease. [Formula presented] Conclusions: The mortality for both cancer and non-cancer patients improved between waves of the pandemic. Advances in detection, prevention and treatment may account for this. Cancer was no longer a risk factor for mortality in the second wave, however SACT and metastatic cancer remained risk factors for mortality within the cancer cohort. This emphasises the need for ongoing protection of patients with advanced cancer and those on SACT, including through their prioritisation for COVID-19 vaccination globally.

As a scientific field, it has been heavily criticized for disproportionately targeting the maternal body and reproducing deterministic views of biological sex (Kenney and Mller, 2017; Lapp, 2018; Richardson et al., 2014). And yet, it also represents the culmination of a long tradition of engaging with developmental biology as a feminist cause, because of the dispersal of the supposed master code of DNA among wider cellular, organismic and ecological contexts (Keller, 1988). In this paper, we explore a number of tensions at the intersection of sex, gender and trauma that are playing out in the emerging area of neuroepigenetics - a relatively new subfield of epigenetics specifically interested in environment-brain relations through epigenetic modifications in neurons. Using qualitative interviews with leading scientists, we explore how trauma is conceptualized in neuroepigenetics, paying attention to its gendered dimensions. We address a number of concerns raised by feminist STS researchers in regard to epigenetics, and illustrate why we believe close engagement with neuroepigenetic claims, and neuroepigenetic researchers themselves, is a crucial step for social scientists interested in questions of embodiment and trauma. We argue this for three reasons: (1) Neuroepigenetic studies are recognizing the agential capacities of biological materials such as genes, neurotransmitters and methyl groups, and how they influence memory formation; (2) Neuroepigenetic conceptions of trauma are yet to be robustly coupled with social and anthropological theories of violence (Eliot, 2021; Nelson, 2021; Walby, 2013); (3) In spite of the gendered assumptions we find in neuroepigenetics, there are fruitful spaces C through collaboration C to be conceptualizing gender beyond culture-biology and nature-nurture binaries (Lock and Nguyen, 2010). To borrow Gravlees (2009: 51) phrase, we find reason for social scientists to consider how gender is not only constructed, but how it may become biology via epigenetic and other biological pathways. Ultimately, we argue that a robust epigenetic methodology is one which values the integrity of expertise outside its own field, and can have an open, not empty mind to cross-disciplinary dialogue.","output":"Gender Beneath the Skull: Agency, Trauma and Persisting Stereotypes in Neuroepigenetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to provide a snapshot of workers' experience while working from home (WFH) during the Australian lockdown in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The risk of bias for each trial was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. RevMan 5.4 software was used for data analyses. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the online GRADEpro tool. RESULTS: Seven RCTs including 1079 participants were identified. The overall bias was assessed as \\"-high risk of bias\\" for all included trials. Oral CPM investigated were: Lianhua Qingwen capsule/granules (LHQW), Jinhua Qinggan granules (JHQG), Huoxiang Zhengqi dripping pills (HXZQ), Toujie Quwen granules (TJQW) and Lianhua Qingke granules (LHQK). Compared with conventional western therapy alone for people with COVID-19: regarding the main outcomes, the results showed that oral CPM combined with conventional western therapy improved cure rate (RRa?=a?1.20, 95 % CI 1.04-1.38, involving LHQW and TJQW), reduced aggravation rate (RRa?=a?0.50, 95 % CI 0.29 - 0.85, involving LHQW, JHQG, LHQK and TJQW); with regard to additional outcomes, the results showed that add-on oral CPM shortened the duration of fever, cough and fatigue, improved the recovery rate of cough and fatigue, and increased the improvement and recovery rate of chest CT manifestations. There were some differences in therapeutic effects among various CPMs for the same COVID-19 outcome. The use of TJQW and LHQG appeared not to increase the risk of adverse events, but JHQG may cause mild diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Low-certainty or very low-certainty evidence demonstrated that oral CPM may have add-on potential therapeutic effects for patients with non-serious COVID-19.

Clinicians claim that the surge demonstrates a deregulated immune defence in host, as infected cell expression analysis depicts a delay in type-I (interferon-I) and type-III IFNs expression, along with a limited Interferon-Stimulated Gene response, which later resume and culminates in elicitation of several cytokines including- IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF, IL-17, MCP-1, IP-10 and IL-10 etc. Although cytokines are messenger molecules of the immune system, but their increased concentration results in inflammation, infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lung injury in patients. This inflammatory response results in the precarious pathogenesis of COVID-19; thus, a complete estimation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is vital in designing a harmless and effective vaccine. In pathogenesis analysis, it emerges that a timely forceful type-I IFN production (18C24hrs post infection) promotes innate and acquired immune responses, while a delay in IFNs production (3C4days post infection) actually renders both innate and acquired responses ineffective in fighting infection. Further, underlying conditions including hypertension, obesity, cardio-vascular disease etc may increase the chances of putting people in risk groups, which end up having critical form of infection.

This study was designed to explore whether free thyroxin (FT4) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels affected the mortality of patients with COVID-19 presenting with NTI. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 complicated with NTI who were treated at our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into low TSH and normal TSH groups, as well as low and normal-high FT4 group, according to the reference range of TSH or FT4 levels. The 90-day mortality and critical illness rates were compared among patients with low and normal TSH levels, as well as among patients with low FT4 levels and normal-high FT4 levels; in addition, differences in demographic and laboratory data were compared. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations of TSH and FT4 levels with mortality. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients with low FT3 levels and without a history of thyroid disease were included, 68% of whom had normal FT4 and TSH levels. Critical illness rates (74.07% VS 37.40%, P = 0.001) and mortality rates (51.85% VS 22.76%, P = 0.002) were significantly higher in the low TSH group than in the normal TSH group. Although no significant difference in the critical illness rate was found (P = 0.296), the mortality rate was significantly higher in the low FT4 group (P = 0.038). Low TSH levels were independently related to 90-day mortality (hazard ratio = 2.78, 95% CI:1.42-5.552, P = 0.003).

This review analyzes traditional and nontraditional antibacterial agents and modulators in clinical development current on 30 June 2021 with activity against the WHO priority pathogens mycobacteria and Clostridioides difficile. Since 2017, 12 new antibacterial drugs have been approved globally, but only vaborbactam belongs to a new antibacterial class. Also innovative is the cephalosporin derivative cefiderocol, which incorporates an iron-chelating siderophore that facilitates Gram-negative bacteria cell entry. Overall, there were 76 antibacterial agents in clinical development (45 traditional and 31 nontraditional), with 28 in phase 1, 32 in phase 2, 12 in phase 3, and 4 under regulatory evaluation. Forty-one out of 76 (54%) targeted WHO priority pathogens, 16 (21%) were against mycobacteria, 15 (20%) were against C. difficile, and 4 (5%) were nontraditional agents with broad-spectrum effects. Nineteen of the 76 antibacterial agents have new pharmacophores, and 4 of these have new modes of actions not previously exploited by marketed antibacterial drugs. Despite there being 76 antibacterial clinical candidates, this analysis indicated that there were still relatively few clinically differentiated antibacterial agents in late-stage clinical development, especially against critical-priority pathogens.

METHODS Observational cohort study of non-hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from October 1st 2021 - December 11th 2021, using electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. We used propensity matching to select 3 patients not receiving mAbs for each patient who received outpatient sotrovimab treatment. The primary outcome was 28-day hospitalization; secondary outcomes included mortality and severity of hospitalization. RESULTS Of 10,036 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 522 receiving sotrovimab were matched to 1,563 not receiving mAbs. Compared to mAb-untreated patients, sotrovimab treatment was associated with a 63% decrease in the odds of all-cause hospitalization (raw rate 2.1% versus 5.7%; adjusted OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.66) and an 89% decrease in the odds of all-cause 28-day mortality (raw rate 0% versus 1.0%; adjusted OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.0-0.79), and may reduce respiratory disease severity among those hospitalized. CONCLUSION Real-world evidence demonstrated sotrovimab effectiveness in reducing hospitalization and all-cause 28-day mortality among COVID-19 outpatients during the Delta variant phase.","output":"Real World Evidence of the Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody Sotrovimab for Preventing Hospitalization and Mortality in COVID-19 Outpatients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection of avian coronaviruses (AvCoV) in wild birds and the emergence of new AvCoV have increased in the past few years. In the present study, the pathogenicity of three AvCoV isolates was investigated in day-old chicks. One AvCoV isolated from a pigeon, which clustered with the Massachusetts vaccine serotype, and two AvCoV isolated from chickens, which grouped with a Brazilian genotype lineage, were used. Clinical signs, gross lesions, histopathological changes, ciliary activity, viral RNA detection, and serology were evaluated during 42 days post infection. All AvCoV isolates induced clinical signs, gross lesions in the trachea, moderate histopathological changes in the respiratory tract, and mild changes in other tissues. AvCoV isolated from the pigeon sample caused complete tracheal ciliostasis over a longer time span. Specific viral RNA was detected in all tissues, but the highest RNA loads were detected in the digestive tract (cloacal swabs and ileum). The highest antibody levels were also detected in the group infected with an isolate from the pigeon. These results confirm the pathogenicity of Brazilian variants, which can cause disease and induce gross lesions and histopathological changes in chickens.

The directive caused a temporary slowdown of screening programs including surveillance colonoscopies for colorectal cancer (CRC). Our goal was to determine if there was a difference in patient and tumour characteristics between CRC patients treated surgically prior to the COVID-19 directive compared to CRC patients treated after the slowdown. METHODS: CRC resections collected within the Champlain catchment area of eastern Ontario in the 6 months prior to COVID-19 (August 1, 2019CJanuary 31, 2020) were compared to CRC resections collected in the 6 months post-COVID-19 slowdown (August 1, 2020CJanuary 31, 2021). Clinical (e.g., gender, patient age, tumour site, and clinical presentation) and pathological (tumour size, tumour stage, nodal stage, and lymphovascular invasion) features were evaluated using chi-square tests, T-tests, and MannCWhitney tests where appropriate. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-eight CRC specimens were identified (173 pre-COVID-19, 165 post-COVID-19 slowdown). CRC patients treated surgically post-COVID-19 slowdown had larger tumours (44 mm vs. 35 mm; P = 0.0048) and were more likely to have presented emergently (24% vs. 10%; P < 0.001). Although there was a trend towards higher tumour stage, nodal stage, and clinical stage, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Other demographic and pathologic variables including patient gender, age, and tumour site were similar between the two cohorts. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 slowdown resulted in a shift in the severity of disease experienced by CRC patients in Ontario.

Indirect evidence from related conditions must therefore inform inferences regarding benefits and harms. To support a guideline for managing COVID-19, we conducted systematic reviews examining the impact of corticosteroids in COVID-19 and related severe acute respiratory illnesses. METHODS: We searched standard international and Chinese biomedical literature databases and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing corticosteroids versus no corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). For acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we updated the most recent rigorous systematic review. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool relative risks and then used baseline risk in patients with COVID-19 to generate absolute effects. RESULTS: In ARDS, according to 1 small cohort study in patients with COVID-19 and 7 RCTs in non-COVID-19 populations (risk ratio [RR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.93, mean difference 17.3% fewer; low-quality evidence), corticosteroids may reduce mortality. In patients with severe COVID-19 but without ARDS, direct evidence from 2 observational studies provided very low-quality evidence of an increase in mortality with corticosteroids (hazard ratio [HR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.29, mean difference 11.9% more), as did observational data from influenza studies. Observational data from SARS and MERS studies provided very low-quality evidence of a small or no reduction in mortality. Randomized controlled trials in CAP suggest that corticosteroids may reduce mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.98, 3.1% lower; very low-quality evidence), and may increase hyperglycemia.

The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. The aim of the study was to make a preliminary assessment of the epidemiological impact of the Test and Trace programme using publicly available data. Methods: We used COVID-19 daily case data from Public Health England to infer incidence of new infections and estimate the reproduction number (R) for each of the 150 Upper-Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs) in England and nationally, before and after the launch of the Test and Trace programme on the Isle of Wight. We used Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods to estimate R and compared the Isle of Wight with other UTLAs using a synthetic control method. Findings: We observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch of the Test and Trace programme. The Isle of Wight had a marked reduction in R, from 13 before the Test and Trace programme to 05 after by one of our measures, and went from having the third highest R before the Test and Trace programme, to the twelfth lowest afterwards compared with other UTLAs. Interpretation: Our results show that the epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled quickly and effectively after the launch of Test and Trace. Our findings highlight the need for further research to determine the causes of the reduction in the spread of the disease, as these could be translated into local and national non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in the period before a treatment or vaccination for COVID-19 becomes available.

In this study, we evaluated the association between use of methylprednisolone and key clinical outcomes. METHODS: Clinical outcomes associated with the use of methylprednisolone were assessed in an unmatched, case-control study; a subset of patients also underwent propensity-score matching. Patients were admitted between March 1 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days by 28 days after admission. Secondary outcomes included extubation, mortality, discharge, positive cultures, and hyperglycemia. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients met inclusion criteria. Propensity matching yielded a cohort of 42 well-matched pairs. Groups were similar except for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use, which were more common in patients who did not receive methylprednisolone. Mean ventilator free-days were significantly higher in patients treated with methylprednisolone (6.217.45 versus 3.146.22; P = 0.044). The probability of extubation was also increased in patients receiving methylprednisolone (45% versus 21%; P = 0.021), and there were no significant differences in mortality (19% versus 36%; P = 0.087).

In Guangzhou, China, a small outbreak, involving less than 100 residents, emerged in March and April 2020, and comprehensive and near-real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. When the numbers of confirmed cases among overseas travelers increased, public health measures were enhanced by shifting from self-quarantine to central quarantine and SARS-CoV-2 testing for all overseas travelers. In an analysis of 109 imported cases, we found diverse viral variants distributed in the global viral phylogeny, which were frequently shared within households but not among passengers on the same flight. In contrast to the viral diversity of imported cases, local transmission was predominately attributed to two specific variants imported from Africa, including local cases that reported no direct or indirect contact with imported cases. The introduction events of the virus were identified or deduced before the enhanced measures were taken. These results show that the interventions were effective in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and they ruled out the possibility of cryptic transmission of viral variants from the first wave in January and February 2020.

METHODS A 3D radial ultrashort TE (UTE) sequence with superior-inferior navigators was used to acquire pulmonary data during free breathing. All acquired data were binned into different motion states according to the respiratory signal extracted from superior-inferior navigators. Motion-resolved images were reconstructed using eXtra-Dimensional (XD) UTE reconstruction. The initial motion fields were generated by registering images at each motion state to other motion states in motion-resolved images. A motion-state weighted motion-compensation (MostMoCo) reconstruction algorithm was proposed to reconstruct the dynamic UTE images. This technique, termed as MostMoCo-UTE, was compared with XD-UTE and iterative motion-compensation (iMoCo) on a porcine lung and 10 subjects. RESULTS MostMoCo reconstruction provides higher peak SNR (37.0 vs. 35.4 and 34.2) and structural similarity (0.964 vs. 0.931 and 0.947) compared to XD-UTE and iMoCo in the porcine lung experiment. Higher apparent SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio are achieved using MostMoCo in the human experiment. MostMoCo reconstruction better preserves the temporal variations of signal intensity of parenchyma compared to iMoCo, shows reduced random noise and improved sharpness of anatomical structures compared to XD-UTE. In the porcine lung experiment, the quantification of ventilation using MostMoCo images is more accurate than that using XD-UTE and iMoCo images. CONCLUSION The proposed MostMoCo-UTE provides improved quality of structural images and quantification of ventilation for free-breathing pulmonary MRI.

University students, who are already recognised as a vulnerable population, are at elevated risk of mental health issues given COVID-19-related disruptions to higher education. To assist universities in effectively allocating resources to the launch of targeted, population-level interventions, the current study aimed to uncover predictors of university students psychological wellbeing during the pandemic via a data-driven approach. Methods: Data were collected from 3973 Australian university students ((median age = 22, aged from 18 to 79); 70.6% female)) at five time points during 2020. Feature selection was conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify predictors from a comprehensive set of variables. Selected variables were then entered into an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to compare coefficients and assess statistical significance. Results: Six negative predictors of university students psychological wellbeing emerged: White/European ethnicity, restriction stress, perceived worry on mental health, dietary changes, perceived sufficiency of distancing communication, and social isolation. Physical health status, emotional support, and resilience were positively associated with students psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has the largest effect on students psychological wellbeing. Notably, age, gender, international status, and educational level did not emerge as predictors of wellbeing. Conclusion: To cost-effectively support student wellbeing through 2021 and beyond, universities should consider investing in internet- and tele- based interventions explicitly targeting perceived social isolation among students. Course-based online forums as well as internet- and tele-based logotherapy may be promising candidates for improving students psychological wellbeing.","output":"Identifying Predictors of University Students Wellbeing during the COVID-19 PandemicA Data-Driven Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Toxoplasma gondii","output":"Toxoplasma gondii"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent incidence of terrible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV\\\\2) has presently experienced some noteworthy mutations since its discovery in 2019 in Wuhan, China.

This means of physical culture can provide the maximum level of functional and physical characteristics to achieve high performance, emotional mood, and healthy life activity. The study involved bachelors in the Siberian State Scientific and Technical University named after M. F. Reshetnev, who had been ill with COVID-19. Classes of therapeutic physical culture will allow to reveal the great adaptive potential of the human body, to form a long-term adaptation, which consists in the restructuring of the body at the molecular, cellular level, in tissues, organs, organ systems and intersystem level, which determines the positive morphological and functional features of the trained organism as a manifestation of the biological norm. The frequency, intensity, direction of physical exercises, their duration and combination, the level of fitness, individual characteristics of those engaged and a number of other factors determine the nature and degree of these changes in the body. In future studies, we plan to use health-improving walking for rehabilitation in the period after AIDS for university teachers aged 50-59 years, as the most vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, it should be noted that when exposed to physical exertion, muscle fibers are regenerated, becoming overgrown with a larger amount of protein material than it was originally. That is why the physical capabilities of the muscles are improved, due to the distribution of the load on a larger amount of muscle tissue. The synthesis of more muscle fiber requires the delivery of more oxygen and nutrients to the cells not only of the muscles, but also of all body systems. Increased blood flow contributes to an increase in the lumen of blood vessels, which increases the efficiency of the cardiovascular system, which is especially important during rehabilitation in the post-covid period. ? 2021 by authors, all rights reserved.

The prevalence of obesity was approximately 13% among world's adult population. Recently, several reports suggested that the interference of gut microbiota composition and function is associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity. Gut microbiota produce a board range of metabolites involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, leading to the alteration in host metabolism. However, systematic evaluation of the relationship between gut microbiota, gut metabolite and host metabolite profiles in obese adults is still lacking. In this study, we used comparative metagenomics and metabolomics analysis to determine the gut microbiota and gut-host metabolite profiles in six normal and obese adults of Chinese origin, respectively. Following the functional and pathway analysis, we aimed to understand the possible impact of gut microbiota on the host metabolites via the change in gut metabolites. The result showed that the change in gut microbiota may result in the modulation of gut metabolites contributing to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and homolactic fermentation. Furthermore, integrated metabolomic analysis demonstrated a possible positive correlation of dysregulated metabolites in the gut and host, including l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, uric acid, kynurenic acid, cholesterol sulfate and glucosamine, which were reported to contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. The findings of this study provide the possible association between gut microbiota-metabolites and host metabolism in obese adults.

Over the next 4 years, 1487 (1173 males) patients were re-evaluated due to angina reoccurrence. 699 patients demonstrated the indications for coronary angiography. RESULTS: The restenosis of the previously stented segment was detected in 84 (12%) cases, the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in 306 (44%), the combination of restenosis and atherosclerosis progression in 63 (9%), and the absence of these complications in 245 (35%) cases.

It is characterized by hotspots of high infections interspersed within regions where infections are sporadic to absent. In this work, the sparseness of COVID-19 infections and their time variations were analyzed across the US at scales ranging from 10 km (county scale) to 2600 km (continental scale). It was found that COVID-19 cases are multi-scaling with a multifractality kernel that monotonically approached that of the underlying population. The spatial correlation of infections between counties increased rapidly in March 2020; that rise continued but at a slower pace subsequently, trending towards the spatial correlation of the population agglomeration. This shows that the disease had already spread across the USA in early March such that travel restriction thereafter (starting on March 15(th) 2020) had minor impact on the subsequent spatial propagation of COVID-19. The ramifications of targeted interventions on spatial patterns of new infections were explored using the epidemiological susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model mapped onto the population agglomeration template. These revealed that re-opening rural areas would have a smaller impact on the spread and evolution of the disease than re-opening urban (dense) centers which would disturb the system for months. This study provided a novel way for interpreting the spatial spread of COVID-19, along with a practical approach (multifractals/SIR/spectral slope) that could be employed to capture the variability and intermittency at all scales while maintaining the spatial structure.","output":"Population agglomeration is a harbinger of the spatial complexity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma in the Caribbean is advancing in prevalence and morbidity. Though viral respiratory tract infections are reported triggers for exacerbations, information on these infections with asthma is sparse in Caribbean territories. We examined the distribution of respiratory viruses and their association with seasons in acute and stable asthmatic children in Trinidad. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 70 wheezing children attending the emergency department for nebulisation and 80 stable control subjects (2 to 16 yr of age) in the asthma clinic, nasal specimens were collected during the dry (n = 38, January to May) and rainy (n = 112, June to December) seasons. A multitarget, sensitive, specific high-throughput Respiratory MultiCode assay tested for respiratory-virus sequences for eight distinct groups: human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: Wheezing children had a higher [(2 )= 5.561, p = 0.018] prevalence of respiratory viruses compared with stabilized asthmatics (34.3% (24) versus (vs.) 17.5% (14)). Acute asthmatics were thrice as likely to be infected with a respiratory virus (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.2 C 5.3). The predominant pathogens detected in acute versus stable asthmatics were the rhinovirus (RV) (n = 18, 25.7% vs. n = 7, 8.8%; p = 0.005), respiratory syncytial virus B (RSV B) (n = 2, 2.9% vs. n = 4, 5.0%), and enterovirus (n = 1, 1.4% vs. n = 2, 2.5%). Strong odds for rhinoviral infection were observed among nebulised children compared with stable asthmatics (p = 0.005, OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.4 C 9.3,). RV was prevalent throughout the year (Dry, n = 6, 15.8%; Rainy, n = 19, 17.0%) and without seasonal association [(2 )= 0.028, p = 0.867]. However it was the most frequently detected virus [Dry = 6/10, (60.0%); Rainy = 19/28, (67.9%)] in both seasons. CONCLUSION: Emergent wheezing illnesses during childhood can be linked to infection with rhinovirus in Trinidad's tropical environment. Viral-induced exacerbations of asthma are independent of seasons in this tropical climate. Further clinical and virology investigations are recommended on the role of infections with the rhinovirus in Caribbean childhood wheeze.","output":"Distribution and seasonality of rhinovirus and other respiratory viruses in a cross-section of asthmatic children in Trinidad, West Indies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: France has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, burn out and the high proportion of post-traumatic stress disorder proved to be the most expected troubles caused by this pandemic and the confinement. Medico-psychological emergency units (CUMP) have been solicited at the very early stage of the pandemic because CUMP units are very well known by the French government and systematically associated to emergency plans. METHODS: In this article we describe the process which has been developed to cope with the psychological needs in the general population. At a first level, platforms of volunteers specialised into listening were available. Then those platforms could directly mobilise the CUMP in case of psychiatric disorders. It ran over the whole first wave and it has been reactivated because of the second confinement in France. RESULTS: During the first wave, approximately 1% of all the calls made on the national Covid number required to be redirected to the listening platforms. Of this group, 4% were related to reactive pathology or a psychiatric decompensating that required adapted and specialised care. CONCLUSION: The high rates of psychological distress detected in the general population in recent scientific literature seem discrepant with our findings of relatively low reorientation towards the CUMP. Nevertheless, our study highlights that the response of the CUMP network in France during the first wave was supportive. The second wave displays its adaptability to the public health policies.","output":"An appropriate and reactive response to the repeated waves of the COVID-19 pandemic by the national medico-psychological network (CUMP) in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La COVID-19 es la infeccin causada por un nuevo coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) y se ha extendido rpidamente por todo el mundo desde que se reportaron los primeros casos en China en diciembre de 2019.

The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to long COVID have not been adequately explained. Our aim is to investigate the basis of pulmonary susceptibility during sequelae and the possibility that prothrombotic states may influence long-term pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19. The patients lungs remain vulnerable during the recovery stage due to persistent shedding of the virus, the inflammatory environment, the prothrombotic state, and injury and subsequent repair of the blood-air barrier. The transformation of inflammation to proliferation and fibrosis, hypoxia-involved vascular remodeling, vascular endothelial cell damage, phosphatidylserine-involved hypercoagulability, and continuous changes in serological markers all contribute to post-discharge lung injury. Considering the important role of microthrombus and arteriovenous thrombus in the process of pulmonary functional lesions to organic lesions, we further study the possibility that prothrombotic states, including pulmonary vascular endothelial cell activation and hypercoagulability, may affect long-term pulmonary symptoms in long COVID. Early use of combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is a promising approach to reduce the incidence of pulmonary sequelae. Essentially, early treatment can block the occurrence of thrombotic events. Because impeded pulmonary circulation causes large pressure imbalances over the alveolar membrane leading to the infiltration of plasma into the alveolar cavity, inhibition of thrombotic events can prevent pulmonary hypertension, formation of lung hyaline membranes, and lung consolidation.","output":"Persistent Lung Injury and Prothrombotic State in Long COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Breakthrough infections after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported.

Our primary outcome was severe disease defined as hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Among 456 persons cases of breakthrough infection and 456 unvaccinated matched controls with confirmed infection, median age was 45 years, 60.7% were males, and 1 comorbid condition was present in 61.2% of the vaccinated and 47.8% of the unvaccinated persons (P=0.009).

In mid-2020, there was significant concern that the overlapping 2020C2021 influenza season and COVID-19 pandemic would overwhelm already stressed health care systems in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly if influenza immunization rates were low. Methods. Using a mathematical susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) compartmental model incorporating the age-specific viral transmission rates and disease severity of Austin, Texas, a large metropolitan region, we projected the incidence and health care burden for both COVID-19 and influenza across observed levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and influenza immunization rates for the 2020C2021 season. We then retrospectively compared scenario projections made in August 2020 with observed trends through June 2021. Results. Across all scenarios, we projected that the COVID-19 burden would dwarf that of influenza. In all but our lowest transmission scenarios, intensive care units were overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, with the levels of influenza immunization having little impact on health care capacity needs. Consistent with our projections, sustained nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in Austin prevented COVID-19 from overwhelming health care systems and almost completely suppressed influenza during the 2020C2021 respiratory virus season. Limitations. The model assumed no cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, which might reduce the burden or slow the transmission of 1 or both viruses. Conclusion. Before the widespread rollout of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, COVID-19 was projected to cause an order of magnitude more hospitalizations than seasonal influenza because of its higher transmissibility and severity. Consistent with predictions assuming strong NPIs, COVID-19 strained but did not overwhelm local health care systems in Austin, while the influenza burden was negligible. Implications. Nonspecific NPI efforts can dramatically reduce seasonal influenza burden and preserve health care capacity during respiratory virus season. HIGHLIGHTS: As the COVID-19 pandemic threatened lives worldwide, the Northern Hemisphere braced for a potential twindemic of seasonal influenza and COVID-19. Using a validated mathematical model of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 co-circulation in a large US city, we projected the impact of COVID-19Cdriven nonpharmaceutical interventions combined with influenza vaccination on health care capacity during the 2020C2021 respiratory virus season. We describe analyses conducted during summer 2020 to help US cities prepare for the 2020C2021 influenza season and provide a retrospective evaluation of the initial projections.","output":"Projecting the Combined Health Care Burden of Seasonal Influenza and COVID-19 in the 2020C2021 Season"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Foundations article, the authors reflect on the meaning of time through their past work creating novel roles for psychiatric service users to be involved in the education of health professions trainees and faculty.

The negative consequences of delaying radio-chemotherapy treatment make it necessary to prioritize these patients, the continuation of radiotherapy being indicated even if SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed in the case of patients with moderate and mild symptoms. For an early scenario, the standard chemo-radiotherapy using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique is the preferred option, because it reduces the overall treatment time. For a late scenario with limited resources, hypo-fractionated treatment, with possible omission of chemotherapy for elderly patients and for those who have comorbidities, is recommended. Concurrent chemotherapy is controversial for dose values >2.4 Gy per fraction. The implementation of hypo-fractionated regimens should be based on a careful assessment of dose-volume constraints for organs at risks (OARs), using recommendations from clinical trials or dose conversion based on the linear-quadratic (LQ) model. Induction chemotherapy is not considered the optimal solution in this situation because of the risk of immunosuppression even though in selected groups of patients TPF regimen may bring benefits. Although the MACH-NC meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck cancers did not demonstrate the superiority of induction chemotherapy over concurrent chemoradiotherapy, an induction regimen could be considered for cases with an increased risk of metastasis even in the case of a possible Covid-19 pandemic scenario.","output":"New Challenges of Treatment for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancers in the Covid-19 Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New advancements in the medical community have rapidly occurred with the development of medical information across the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic.

SalivaDirect is a nucleic acid extraction-free method for detecting SARS-CoV2 in saliva specimens. Studies evaluating the concordance of gold standard NPS and newly developed SalivaDirect protocols are limited. The aim of our study was to to assess SalivaDirect as an alternative method for COVID-19 testing. Methods: Matching NPS and saliva samples were analysed from a cohort of symptomatic (n=127) and asymptomatic (n=181) participants recruited from hospital and university settings, respectively. RNA was extracted from NPS while saliva samples were subjected to the SalivaDirect protocol before RT-qPCR analysis. The presence of SARS-Cov-2 was assessed using RdRP and N1 gene targets in NPS and saliva, respectively. Results: Overall we observed 94.3% sensitivity (95% CI 87.2-97.5%), and 95.9% specificity (95% CI 92.4-97.8%) in saliva when compared to matching NPS samples. Analysis of concordance demonstrated 95.5% accuracy overall for the saliva test relative to NPS, and a very high level of agreement ( coefficient = 0.889, 95% CI 0.833C0.946) between the two sets of specimens. Fourteen of 308 samples were discordant, all from symptomatic patients. Ct values were >30 in 13/14 and >35 in 6/14 samples. No significant difference was found in the Ct values of matching NPS and saliva sample ( p=0.860). A highly significant correlation (r = 0.475, p<0.0001) was also found between the Ct values of the concordant positive saliva and NPS specimens. Conclusions: Use of saliva processed according to the SalivaDirect protocol represents a valid method to detect SARS-CoV-2. Accurate and less invasive saliva screening is an attractive alternative to current testing methods based on NPS and would afford greater capacity to test asymptomatic populations especially in the context of frequent testing.","output":"Concordance between PCR-based extraction-free saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza is a considerable threat to global public health. Prevention and control depend on awareness and protective behaviours of the general population as well as high risk-groups. This study aims to explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to avian influenza among poultry workers in Nepal. METHODS: The study was based on a cross-sectional study design, using a structured questionnaire administered in face-to-face interviews with 96 poultry workers age 15 and above from the Rupandehi district in Nepal. RESULTS: The majority of respondents were male (80%), mean age was 35 (SD = 11.6). Nearly everybody was aware that AI cases had been detected in Nepal and that poultry workers were at risk for infection. The major sources of AI information were radio, TV and newspapers. Knowledge about preventive measures was high with regard to some behaviours (hand washing), but medium to low with regard to others (using cleaning and disinfecting procedures or protective clothing). Poultry workers who got their information from TV and newspapers and those who were more afraid of contracting AI had higher knowledge than those who did not. Being employed as compared to being an owner of a poultry farm as well as having a high level of knowledge was associated with practising more preventive behaviours. While on one hand many specific government control measures found a high degree of acceptance, a majority of study participants also thought that government control and compensation measures as a whole were insufficient.

However, other host factors might also play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing new directions for antiviral treatments. GRP78 is a stress-inducible chaperone important for entry and infectivity for many viruses. Recent molecular docking analyses revealed putative interaction between GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (SARS-2-S). Here we report that GRP78 can form a complex with SARS-2-S and ACE2 on the surface and at the perinuclear region typical of the endoplasmic reticulum in VeroE6-ACE2 cells and that the substrate-binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this interaction. In vitro binding studies further confirmed that GRP78 can directly bind to the RBD of SARS-2-S and ACE2. To investigate the role of GRP78 in this complex, we knocked down GRP78 in VeroE6-ACE2 cells. Loss of GRP78 markedly reduced cell surface ACE2 expression and led to activation of markers of the unfolded protein response. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159) selected for its safe clinical profile in preclinical models depleted cell surface GRP78 and reduced cell surface ACE2 expression, as well as SARS-2-S-driven viral entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

Therefore, the development of standard guidelines for the management of traffic accident patients by EMS is crucial to increase the survival rate of traffic accident patients.","output":"Survival Rates and Factors Related to the Survival of Traffic Accident Patients Transported by Emergency Medical Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness; the virus is endemic in West Africa and also of concern with regard to bioterrorism. Transmission of Lassa virus between humans may occur through direct contact with infected blood or bodily secretions. Oral administration of the antiviral drug ribavirin is often considered for postexposure prophylaxis, but no systematically collected data or uniform guidelines exist for this indication. Furthermore, the relatively low secondary attack rates for Lassa fever, the restriction of the area of endemicity to West Africa, and the infrequency of high-risk exposures make it unlikely that controlled prospective efficacy trials will ever be possible. Recommendations for postexposure use of ribavirin can therefore be made only on the basis of a thorough understanding and logical extrapolation of existing data. Here, we review the pertinent issues and propose guidelines based on extensive review of the literature, as well as our experience in this field. We recommend oral ribavirin postexposure prophylaxis for Lassa fever exclusively for definitive high-risk exposures. These guidelines may also serve for exposure to other hemorrhagic fever viruses susceptible to ribavirin.","output":"Review of the Literature and Proposed Guidelines for the Use of Oral Ribavirin as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Lassa Fever"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Refugees and migrants face similar health threats from COVID-19 as their host populations However, inadequate access to essential services and exclusion may makes early detection, testing, diagnosis, contact tracing and seeking care for COVID-19 difficult for refugees and migrants thus increasing the risk of outbreaks in these population and presenting an additional threat to public health This document offers guidance to Member States and partners for the inclusion of refugees and migrants, as part of holistic efforts to respond to COVID-19 epidemics in the general populations","output":"Preparedness, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for refugees and migrants in non-camp settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11th, 2020 (1), requires an early diagnosis to optimize patient management and limit further transmission. .","output":"Evaluation of the Panbio Covid-19 rapid antigen detection test device for the screening of patients with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) are plastic, versatile and highly responsive cells, with morphological and functional aspects that uniquely match the tissues they supply. The response of these cells to oxygen oscillations is an essential aspect of tissue homeostasis, and is finely tuned to maintain organ function during physiological and metabolic challenges. Primary MVEC from two continuous capillary networks with distinct organ microenvironments, those of the lung and brain, were pre-conditioned at normal atmospheric ( 21 %) and physiological (5 and 10 %) O2 levels, and subsequently used to compare organ-specific MVEC hypoxia response. Brain MVEC preferentially stabilise HIF-2 in response to hypoxia, whereas lung MVEC primarily accumulate HIF-1; however, this does not result in significant differences at the level of transcriptional activation of hypoxia-induced genes. Glycolytic activity is comparable between brain and lung endothelial cells, and is affected by oxygen pre-conditioning, while glucose uptake is not changed by oxygen pre-conditioning and is observed to be consistently higher in brain MVEC. Conversely, MVEC mitochondrial activity is organ-specific; brain MVEC maintain a higher relative mitochondrial spare capacity at 5% O2, but not following hyperoxic priming. If maintained at supra-physiological O2 levels, both MVEC fail to respond to hypoxia, and have severely compromised and delayed induction of the glycolytic shifts required for survival, an effect which is particularly pronounced in brain MVEC. Oxygen preconditioning also differentially shapes the composition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in the two MVEC populations. Lung MVEC primed at physioxia have lower levels of all ETC complexes compared to hyperoxia, an effect exacerbated by hypoxia. Conversely, brain MVEC expanded in physioxia display increased complex II (SDH) activity, which is further augmented during hypoxia. SDH activity in brain MVEC primed at 21 % O2 is ablated; upon hypoxia, this results in the accumulation of near-toxic levels of succinate in these cells. Our data suggests that, even though MVEC are primarily glycolytic, mitochondrial integrity in brain MVEC is essential for metabolic responses to hypoxia; these responses are compromised when cells are exposed to supra-physiological levels of oxygen. This work demonstrates that the study of MVEC in normal cell culture environments do not adequately represent physiological parameters found in situ, and show that the unique metabolism and function of organ-specific MVEC can be reprogrammed by external oxygen, significantly affecting the timing and degree of downstream responses. Graphical Abstract In brief Hypoxia sensing by microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) is organ-specific, and efficacy of response is affected by external oxygen. While glycolytic capacity is mostly maintained in MVEC regardless of organ or origin, mitochondrial function is required for adequate sensing and timely metabolic shift to glycolysis. Hyperoxygenation of MVEC compromises mitochondrial function, glycolytic shift and survival to hypoxia. Highlights Environmental O2 influences MVEC hypoxia response in an organ-specific fashion Brain MVEC are unable to respond and survive to hypoxia if hyperoxygenated prior to stress MVEC glycolytic capacity is not affected by O2, but the increase in glucose uptake and shift to glycolytic metabolism stifled and delayed in hyperoxidized MVEC High O2 ablates activity of mitochondria complex II in brain MVEC, significantly disturbing succinate levels Disruption of mitochondrial integrity compromises hypoxia sensing irrespective of glycolytic capacity","output":"MICROVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL CELL ADAPTATION TO HYPOXIA IS ORGAN-SPECIFIC AND CONDITIONED BY ENVIRONMENTAL OXYGEN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In situ hybridization is a method for detecting specific nucleic acid sequences within individual cells.

These medications may have an impairing effect on mood or perception and may induce harmful behaviors. Nevertheless, in Europe, studies on their importance from a medico-legal perspective are scarce. To fill this gap, we evaluate the determinants of these drugs in a retrospective study based on data obtained from forensic autopsies. Toxicological analyses were performed on 394 blood samples from compulsory autopsies at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Las Palmas. Of the samples, 41% (159) were positive for at least one psychotropic, with benzodiazepines being the most frequently detected (24.1%), followed by opiates and antidepressants. Benzodiazepines, opiates, and antidepressants were detected more frequently in men who suffered a violent death. More than 30% of the positive samples showed two or more drugs, suggesting a prevalence of polypharmacy among forensic autopsy subjects, with the most frequently combination found being benzodiazepines plus opiates (28.3% of positive samples). A combination of opiates plus antidepressants was also found in subjects involved in violent deaths. Our results suggest that more than 40% of the adult European population involved in medico-legal issues may be under the influence of legal psychotropics. The link between violent deaths and the use of medical psychotropics is particularly worrisome and indicates that these drugs should be carefully monitored in developed countries, in all forensic autopsies, in a similar way to illegal psychotropics.","output":"Medical Psychotropics in Forensic Autopsies in European Countries: Results from a Three-Year Retrospective Study in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed education in medical residencies with the need to transition to a virtual format. The objective of this study is to assess the adoption of a virtual format for grand rounds, M&M, and education of the surgical department. METHOD A 25 question online survey was developed using Qualtrics and distributed to faculty and resident physicians in the Department of Surgery from March to April 2021. RESULTS Fifty four out of 79 potential respondents (68%) completed the survey. Twenty-seven out of 54 (50%) respondents stated they were more likely to be participating in another activity most of the time or always. During to in-person conferences, 20/54 (37%) of participants reported being more distracted by other activities. Forty-two out of 54 (78%) participants strongly agree that virtual conferences are more flexible with their schedule and saves them travel time. All of the faculty want conferences to continue virtually (with or without an in-person component) citing virtual conferences are more flexible with their schedule and saves travel time. However, 4/26 (15%) of residents responded not wanting to continue virtual education citing work distractions and not truly having protected time. CONCLUSION As the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is continuing with new variants, the virtual education and conference format is necessary.

Various inflammatory conditions have been linked to cardiovascular disease, a major cause of global mortality and morbidity. OBJECTIVE We sought to systematically review and meta-analyze population-based studies assessing associations between atopic eczema and specific cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health were searched from inception to December 2017. We obtained pooled estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. We used a multivariate Bayesian meta-regression model to estimate the slope of effect of increasing atopic eczema severity on cardiovascular outcomes. RESULTS Nineteen relevant studies were included. The effects of atopic eczema reported in cross-sectional studies were heterogeneous, with no evidence for pooled associations with angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. In cohort studies atopic eczema was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (n = 4; relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25), stroke (n = 4; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), ischemic stroke n = 4; RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14-1.20), angina (n = 2; RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.24), and heart failure (n = 2; RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51). Prediction intervals were wide for myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk of cardiovascular outcomes appeared to increase with increasing severity (mean RR increase between severity categories, 1.15; 95% credibility interval, 1.09-1.21; uncertainty interval, 1.04-1.28). CONCLUSION Significant associations with cardiovascular outcomes were more common in cohort studies but with considerable between-study heterogeneity. Increasing atopic eczema severity was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes.

METHODOLOGY: 342 COVID-19 were enrolled from ten different hospitals in China. The clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The body mass index (BMI) of the mild patients (Group A) was higher than those in severe patients (Group B) and critical patients (Group C); The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of Group A was lower than those of the other two groups; Sex, age, and BMI, was strongly correlated with Clinical classification (CT); Among the laboratory test results, Neutrophil (NEU%), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), LDH, and blood glucose (BG) were positively correlated with CT; Lymphocyte ( LYM%), Platelet (PLT), Albumin (ALB), and Creatinine (Cr) were negatively correlated with CT.

Vaccination is an effective approach to curb virus spread, but several variants (e.g., delta, delta plus, omicron, and IHU) appear to weaken or possibly escape immune protection. Thus, novel and quickly scalable approaches to restrain SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Multiple evidences showed thermal sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 and negative correlation between environmental temperature and COVID-19 transmission with unknown mechanism.

Mechanistically, heat treatment promotes E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNF598-dependent NSP12 ubiquitination leading to proteasomal degradation and significantly decreases SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number and viral titer. A mild daily heat treatment maintains low levels of both wild-type and P323L mutant of NSP12, suggesting clinical potential.

Considering that the protection of human life is a central focus in the Paris Agreement, the naturally endowed properties of the human body to protect itself from environmental extremes should form the core of an integrated and multifaceted solution against global warming. Scholars believe that heat and thermoregulation played important roles in the evolution of life and continue to be a central mechanism that allows humans to explore, labor and live in extreme conditions. However, the international effort against global warming has focused primarily on protecting the environment and on the reduction of greenhouse gases by changing human behavior, industrial practices and government policies, with limited consideration given to the nature and design of the human thermoregulatory system. Global warming is projected to challenge the limits of human thermoregulation, which can be enhanced by complementing innate human thermo-plasticity with the appropriate behavioral changes and technological innovations. Therefore, the primary aim of this review is to discuss the fundamental concepts and physiology of human thermoregulation as the underlying bases for human adaptation to global warming. Potential strategies to extend human tolerance against environmental heat through behavioral adaptations and technological innovations will also be discussed.

Thus, there is always a quest to inhibit these ion channels, which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV2 in humans. Considering this, in the present study, authors employed computational approaches for studying the structure as well as function of the human 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein as well as its interaction with various phytochemicals. Result obtained revealed that &#945;-helix and loops present in this protein experience random movement under optimal condition, which in turn modulate ion channel activity; thereby aiding the pathogenesis caused via SARS-CoV2 in human and other vertebrates.

BACKGROUND 70-90% of surgeons who regularly perform LS report musculoskeletal symptoms, mainly in neck and shoulders. Data regarding the potential ergonomic benefits of RALS in a clinical setting is very limited. METHODS Twelve surgeons with advanced experience in both LS and RALS each performed 2 hysterectomies on the same day. LS was performed standing, RALS sitting, the latter allowing forearm and head support. Bipolar surface electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from several muscles and was expressed relative to EMG during maximum contractions (%EMGmax). Gaps per minute plus static (p0.1), mean (p0.5), and peak (p0.9) muscle activation were calculated. Perceived exertion was rated before and just after each surgery. RESULTS Neck muscle activity (p0.1 4.7 vs. 3.0%EMGmax, p0.5 7.4 vs. 5.3%EMGmax, p0.9 11.6 vs. 8.2%EMGmax, all P < 0.05) and static shoulder muscle activity (p0.1 5.7 vs. 2.8%EMGmax, P < 0.05) were higher for LS than for RALS. Both a higher level of gaps during RALS and a lower rating of perceived exertion, also for the legs, after RALS supported these observations. However, low back muscle activity was higher for RALS. CONCLUSIONS RALS is significantly less physically demanding than LS, and also feels less strenuous for the surgeons. However, for both types of surgeries, there still is room for improvement of working conditions.

Igeo values of Sb were higher than 5 except for > 1000-m fraction, indicating extremely polluted status. PCA results and elemental ratios indicated that most of the PTEs in road dust were derived from non-exhaust traffic-related sources such as brake pads and tires. Cr, Pb, and Sb had higher HI values than other metals for both adults and children. Sampling sites of heavy traffic and industrial areas showed that the carcinogenic risk exceeded the maximum threshold level (10 - 4). Especially in children, the mean carcinogenic risk (ingestion pathway) of As (6.8  10 - 4) Cd (2.0  10 - 4), and Ni (4.1  10 - 4) exceeded the maximum threshold level, indicating that continuous exposure to road dust may pose a high cancer risk to children.

Assuming limited isolation control and capacity constraints on the number of infections, an optimal quarantine control strategy that balances between the total number of infections and the overall isolation effort is derived from necessary optimality conditions. The specific optimal policy is then obtained by optimizing the switching times of this generalized strategy. In the case of a newly emerged disease, these results can be used in a data-driven receding horizon manner to improve actions as more data becomes available. The proposed approach is applied to publicly available data from the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. In particular, for minimizing the total number of infections or the number of isolated individuals, the simulations indicate that a sufficiently delayed and controlled release of the lock-down are optimal for overcoming the outbreak. The approach can support public health authorities to plan quarantine control policies.","output":"Optimal quarantine control of an infectious outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The palatine tonsils (hereinafter referred to as tonsils) serve as a reservoir for viral infections and play roles in the immune system's first line of defense.

One of these, DIssF, is 3.6 kb in size and exhibits efficient packaging, whereas the other, DIssE, which is 2.3 kb, does not. For more precise mapping, a series of mutant DIssF RNAs with deletions within this 1,480-nucleotide region were constructed. After transfection of in vitro-synthesized mutant DI RNA in MHV-infected cells, the virus product was passaged several times. The efficiency of DI RNA packaging into MHV virions was then estimated by viral homologous interference activity and by analysis of intracellular virus-specific RNAs and virion RNA. The results indicated that an area of 190 nucleotides was necessary for packaging. A computer-generated secondary structural analysis of the A59 and JHM strains of MHV demonstrated that within this 190-nucleotide region a stable stem-loop of 69 nucleotides was common between the two viruses. A DIssE-derived DI DNA which had these 69 nucleotides inserted into the DIssE sequence demonstrated efficient DI RNA packaging. Site-directed mutagenic analysis showed that of these 69 nucleotides, the minimum sequence of the packaging signal was 61 nucleotides and that destruction of the secondary structure abolished packaging ability.

It was reported by some that Chinese herbs played an important role in the treatment of SARS patients. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the possible effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for SARS patients. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the following electronic databases for reports of randomised controlled trials: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to September 2005); EMBASE (1990 to December 2004); and Chinese Biomedical Literature (lssue 2, 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for diagnosed SARS patients were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted the data from each trial. We extracted dichotomous and continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous data, relative risk (RR) was used. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). Overall results were calculated based on the random effects model if heterogeneity existed between studies. If no heterogeneity was detected between the studies, we used the fixed effects model. Using the Z score and the chi square statistic with significance being set at p < 0.05 tested heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS We finally included twelve randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized controlled trial. A total of 654 SARS patients and 12 Chinese herbs were identified. We did not find Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines decreased morbidity versus Western medicines alone. Two herbs may improve symptoms. Five herbs may improve lung infiltrate absorption. Four herbs may decrease the dosage of corticosteroids. Three herbs may improve the quality of life of SARS patients. One herb may shorten the length of stay in hospital. Only two trials reported adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines made no difference in decreasing morbidity versus Western medicines alone. It is possible that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines may improve symptoms, quality of life, and lung infiltrate absorption and decrease the corticosteroid dosage for SARS patients. The evidence is weak because of the poor quality of the included trials. Long-term of follow up of these included trials is needed.","output":"Chinese herbs combined with Western medicine for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disinfectants and sanitizers are essential preventive agents against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, the pandemic crisis was marred by undue hype, which led to the indiscriminate use of disinfectants and sanitizers.

Although there are CDV vaccines available, the disease poses a huge threat to dogs and wildlife hosts due to vaccine failures and lack of effective treatment. Thus, the development of therapeutics is an urgent need to achieve rapid outbreak control and reduce mortality in target species. Gene silencing by RNA interference has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach against different human and animal viruses. In this study, plasmid-based short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against three different regions in either CDV nucleoprotein (N), or large polymerase (L) genes and recombinant adenovirus-expressing N-specific multi-shRNAs were generated. Viral cytopathic effect, virus titration, plaque-forming unit reduction, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis were used to check the efficiency of constructs against CDV. RESULTS: In CDV-infected VerodogSLAM cells, shRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the N gene markedly inhibited the CDV replication in a dose-dependent manner, with viral genomes and titers being decreased by over 99%. Transfection of plasmid-based shRNAs against the L gene displayed weaker inhibition of viral RNA level and virus yield as compared to CDV N shRNAs. A combination of shRNAs targeting three sites in the N gene considerably reduced CDV RNA and viral titers, but their effect was not synergistic. Recombinant adenovirus-expressing multiple shRNAs against CDV N gene achieved a highly efficient knockdown of CDV N mRNAs and successful inhibition of CDV replication. CONCLUSIONS: We found that this strategy had strong silencing effects on CDV replication in vitro. Our findings indicate that the delivery of shRNAs using plasmid or adenovirus vectors potently inhibits CDV replication and provides a basis for the development of therapeutic strategies for clinical trials.

These efforts could be improved by leveraging documented COVID-19Crelated symptoms, findings, and disorders from clinical text sources in an electronic health record. Word embeddings can identify terms related to these clinical concepts from both the biomedical and nonbiomedical domains, and are being shared with the open-source community at large. However, its unclear how useful openly available word embeddings are for developing lexicons for COVID-19Crelated concepts. OBJECTIVE: Given an initial lexicon of COVID-19Crelated terms, this study aims to characterize the returned terms by similarity across various open-source word embeddings and determine common semantic and syntactic patterns between the COVID-19 queried terms and returned terms specific to the word embedding source. METHODS: We compared seven openly available word embedding sources. Using a series of COVID-19Crelated terms for associated symptoms, findings, and disorders, we conducted an interannotator agreement study to determine how accurately the most similar returned terms could be classified according to semantic types by three annotators. We conducted a qualitative study of COVID-19 queried terms and their returned terms to detect informative patterns for constructing lexicons. We demonstrated the utility of applying such learned synonyms to discharge summaries by reporting the proportion of patients identified by concept among three patient cohorts: pneumonia (n=6410), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=8647), and COVID-19 (n=2397). RESULTS: We observed high pairwise interannotator agreement (Cohen kappa) for symptoms (0.86-0.99), findings (0.93-0.99), and disorders (0.93-0.99). Word embedding sources generated based on characters tend to return more synonyms (mean count of 7.2 synonyms) compared to token-based embedding sources (mean counts range from 2.0 to 3.4). Word embedding sources queried using a qualifier term (eg, dry cough or muscle pain) more often returned qualifiers of the similar semantic type (eg, dry returns consistency qualifiers like wet and runny) compared to a single term (eg, cough or pain) queries. A higher proportion of patients had documented fever (0.61-0.84), cough (0.41-0.55), shortness of breath (0.40-0.59), and hypoxia (0.51-0.56) retrieved than other clinical features. Terms for dry cough returned a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 (0.07) than the pneumonia (0.05) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (0.03) populations.

The values of total and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C)?18 and 15 mmol/l, respectivelyalong with normal triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) confirmed the lesions were xanthomas. The data suggested a homozygous form of FH. The level of lipoprotein (a) was high: 270 mg/dl. Initial treatment, based on European recommendations, included Atorvastatin 20 mg and Ezetimibe 10 mg and led to a decrease in LDL-C by 46% for 5 months; however, the patient developed severe statin intolerance. Atorvastatin was replaced with Rosuvastatin 10 mg, but the symptoms persisted. Success was achieved by switching to an intermittent regimen: Rosuvastatin 10 mg three times a week with a daily intake of Ezetimibe 10 mg. However, the results were far from the desired LDL target. LDL-apheresis was advisable, but unfortunately, it is not performed in Bulgaria.

In this prospective study we provide an analysis of resource utilization as a function of outcomes for all MDCs covered by an entire radiology section and provide a time-based cost estimate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, prospective data on all MDCs covered by abdominal radiologists at a single tertiary care academic center were obtained over nine weeks. A predefined questionnaire was used by a single observer who attended every imaging review and recorded the total time spent by the radiologists and several outcome measures. The total time recorded was used to provide a time-based cost estimate using a national salary survey. RESULTS: Six radiologists participated in a total of 57 MDCs, with 577 cases reviewed and discussed. 181 (31%) cases were performed at outside facilities requiring full reinterpretation. Clinically significant revisions to original reports were recorded in 107 (18.5%) cases.

Thus, a ranking algorithm to select highly immunogenic neoantigens of patients is needed urgently in research and clinical practice. RESULTS: We develop TruNeo, an integrated computational pipeline to identify and select highly immunogenic neoantigens based on multiple biological processes. The performance of TruNeo and other algorithms were compared based on data from published literature as well as raw data from a lung cancer patient.

The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device's several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained.

RESULTS Baseline patients had a mean BMI of 50.10 (+-11.19)kg m2, SHBG 23.37 (+-17.47) nmol L, LH 3.83 (+-1.76)mUI ml and TT 8.31 (+-3.24) nmol L. After LSG, patients showed a mean BMI of 35.87 (+-7.02) kg m2 (p 0.001),SHBG 37.81 (+-18.95) nmol L (p 0.05), LH 4.76 (+-2.49)mUI ml (p 0.05), whereas mean TT was 12.7 (?+-3.8) nmol L(p 0.001). The percentage of excess body weight loss (%EBL)was 43.07 (+-9.56) and metabolic syndrome prevalence decreased significantly from 75% to 25% (p 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Beyond BMI loss, LSG significantly improved reproductive hormone levels in morbidly obese males.","output":"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy improves reproductive hormone levels in morbidly obese males -- a series of 28 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.","output":"Estimating number of global importations of COVID-19 from Wuhan, risk of transmission outside mainland China and COVID-19 introduction index between countries outside mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed longstanding racial/ethnic inequities in health risks and outcomes in the U.S.. We sought to identify racial/ethnic differences in presentation and outcomes for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: The American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is a retrospective observational registry capturing consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We present data on the first 7,868 patients by race/ethnicity treated at 88 hospitals across the US between 01/17/2020 and 7/22/2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and COVID-19 cardiorespiratory ordinal severity score (worst to best: death, cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation with mechanical circulatory support, mechanical ventilation with vasopressors/inotrope support, mechanical ventilation without hemodynamic support, and hospitalization without any of the above). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and each outcome adjusting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and presentation features, and accounting for clustering by hospital. Results: Among 7,868 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 33.0% were Hispanic, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 6.3% were Asian, and 35.2% were non-Hispanic White. Hispanic and Black patients were younger than non-Hispanic White and Asian patients and were more likely to be uninsured. Black patients had the highest prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Black patients also had the highest rates of mechanical ventilation (23.2%) and renal replacement therapy (6.6%) but the lowest rates of remdesivir use (6.1%). Overall mortality was 18.4% with 53% of all deaths occurring in Black and Hispanic patients. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for mortality were 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.14) for Black patients, 0.90 (95% CI 0.73-1.11) for Hispanic patients, and 1.31 (95% CI 0.96-1.80) for Asian patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients. The median OR across hospitals was 1.99 (95% CI 1.74-2.48). Results were similar for MACE. Asian patients had the highest COVID-19 cardiorespiratory severity at presentation (adjusted OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.90). Conclusions: Although in-hospital mortality and MACE did not differ by race/ethnicity after adjustment, Black and Hispanic patients bore a greater burden of mortality and morbidity due to their disproportionate representation among COVID-19 hospitalizations.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Differences in Presentation and Outcomes for Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19: Findings from the American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has ramifications for the delivery of newborn nutrition and care services.

Understanding these trends and the epidemiological phenomena that lead to the changing dynamics associated with disease progression is critical for public health officials and the global community to rein in further spread of this and other virulent diseases. Classic epidemiological modeling based on dynamical systems are powerful tools used for modeling and understanding diseases, but often necessitate modifications to the classic compartmental models to reflect empirical observations. In this paper, we present a collection of extensions to the classic SIRS model to support public health decisions associated with viral pandemics. Specifically, we present models that reflect different levels of disease severity among infected individuals, capture the effect of vaccination on different population groups, capture the effect of different vaccines with different levels of effectiveness, and model the impact of a vaccine with varying number of doses. Further, our mathematical models support the investigation of a pandemics trend under the emergence of new variants and the associated reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Our models are supported through numerical simulations, which we use to illustrate phenomena that have been observed in the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also confirm observations that the mild infectious group accounts for the majority of infected individuals, and that prompt immunization results in weaker pandemic waves across all levels of infection as well as a lower number of disease-caused deaths. Finally, using our models, we demonstrate that, when dealing with a single variant and having access to a highly effective vaccine, a three-dose vaccine has a strong ability to reduce the infectious population. However, when a new variant with higher transmissibility and lower vaccine efficiency emerges, it becomes the dominant circulating variant, as was observed in the recent emergence of the Omicron variant.","output":"Projecting the Pandemic Trajectory through Modeling the Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A severe atypical pneumonia designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by The World Health Organization broke out in China and menaced to more than other 30 countries between the end of the year 2002 and June of the year 2003.

Co-infection was frequently found in HBoV-positive patients. Thus, whether HBoV is responsible for the respiratory disease is still arguable. Objectives A comprehensive study was carried out to integrate clinical and virological prevalence in HBoV-positive outpatient children, and to determine genetic and serologic characteristics of HBoV in Shanghai, China. Study design Nasal/throat swabs and sera were obtained over a 2-year period from 817 children with respiratory tract infection to examine the presence of HBoV and its co-infection. The seroepidemiology of HBoV was studied by ELISA and Western blot against the capsid protein VP2-based fragment. Persistence of HBoV was also analyzed in 12 pairs of return-visit cases. Results HBoV was identified in 96 samples (11.8%). The co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 51%. IgM was detected in 55.7% of HBoV RT-PCR-positive patients, and in 72.7% of those who had high viral genome load. In addition, persistent viral DNA positivity was detected in 10 of 12 HBoV-positive cases tested, an average of 14 days later, and one child was still HBoV-positive after 31 days. Conclusion HBoV was found frequently in children with respiratory tract symptoms associated with other respiratory viruses, and persisted in the respiratory tract and in serum and urine.

The fragmentation of authority and overlapping functions in federal, decentralized political systems make them more susceptible to coordination problems than centralized, unitary systems. We apply the concept to pandemics, which require national health system stewardship, using sub-national NPI data that we developed and curated through the Observatory for the Containment of COVID-19 in the Americas to illustrate Punt Politics in Mexico and Brazil. Both countries suffer from protracted, high levels of COVID-19 mortality and inadequate pandemic responses, including little testing and disregard for scientific evidence.

The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia are shown to be affected by some explanatory variables that are recorded daily: recovered COVID-19 cases, critical cases, daily active cases, tests per million, curfew hours, maximal temperatures, maximal relative humidity, maximal wind speed, and maximal pressure. Restrictions applied by the Saudi Arabia government due to the COVID-19 outbreak, from the suspension of Umrah and flights, and the lockdown of some cities with a curfew are based on information about COVID-15. The aim of the paper is to propose some predictive regression models similar to generalized linear models (GLMs) for fitting COVID-19 data in Saudi Arabia to analyze, forecast, and extract meaningful information that helps decision makers. In this direction, we propose some regression models on the basis of inverted exponential distribution (IE-Reg), Bayesian (BReg) and empirical Bayesian regression (EBReg) models for use in conjunction with inverted exponential distribution (IE-BReg and IE-EBReg). In all approaches, we use the logarithm (log) link function, gamma prior and two loss functions in the Bayesian approach, namely, the zero-one and LINEX loss functions. To deal with the outliers in the proposed models, we apply Huber and Tukey's bisquare (biweight) functions. In addition, we use the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm to estimate Bayesian regression coefficients. Further, we compare IE-Reg, IE-BReg, and IE-EBReg using some criteria, such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance (D), and mean squared error (MSE). Finally, we apply the collected data of the daily confirmed from March 23 - June 21, 2020 with the corresponding explanatory variables to the theoretical findings.

We used international patient survey data to explore the hypothesis that greater risk-mitigating behaviour in those receiving targeted therapies may account, at least in part, for this observation. Methods Online surveys were completed by individuals with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMD) (UK only) or psoriasis (globally) between 4th May and 7th September 2020. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between treatment type and risk-mitigating behaviour, adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics. We characterised international variation in a mixed effects model. Results Of 3,720 participants (2,869 psoriasis, 851 RMD) from 74 countries, 2,262 (60.8%) reported the most stringent risk-mitigating behaviour (classified here under the umbrella term shielding). A greater proportion of those receiving targeted therapies (biologics and JAK inhibitors) reported shielding compared to those receiving no systemic therapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.35-1.97) and standard systemic agents (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22-1.56). Shielding was associated with established risk factors for severe COVID-19 (male sex [OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24], obesity [OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54], comorbidity burden [OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15-1.78]), a primary indication of RMD (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.27-1.48) and a positive anxiety or depression screen (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.36-1.80). Modest differences in the proportion shielding were observed across nations. Conclusions Greater risk-mitigating behaviour among people with IMIDs receiving targeted therapies may contribute to the reported lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The behaviour variation across treatment groups, IMIDs and nations reinforces the need for clear evidence-based patient communication on risk mitigation strategies and may help inform updated public health guidelines as the pandemic continues.","output":"Risk mitigating behaviours in people with inflammatory joint and skin disease during the COVID-19 pandemic differ by treatment type: a cross-sectional patient survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: A study of job-seeking anxiety, resilience quotient and family influence on career decision-making is apparently lacking;especially in regards to the impact of the financial crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors, such as the political climate currently in Thailand.

There are currently no specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19 and vaccination programmes, whilst promising, remain in their infancy. A key to restricting the pandemic is the ability to minimize human-human transmission and to predict the infection status of the population in the face of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Success in this area is dependent on the rapid detection of COVID-19 positive individuals with current/previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status. In this regard, the ability to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-Spike protein in patient sera represents a powerful biomarker for confirmation of infection. Here, we report the design of a proof-of-concept cell-based fluorescent serology assay (termed C19-S-I-IFA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. The assay is based on the capture of IgG antibodies in the serum of COVID-19-positive patients using cells exogenously expressing SARS-CoV-2-Spike and their subsequent fluorescent detection. We validate the assay in 30 blood samples collected in Oxford, UK, in 2020 during the height of the pandemic.

The right tail of this distributioncharacterized by spending increases double or triple a persons typical level is over two times more sensitive to the market than the center of the distribution. The relationship is more pronounced for male investors than non-investors and women. Applying the same econometric framework for stock market returns to changes in checking account-based spending and changes in labor income does not yield a statistically discernible relationship in our sample. Meanwhile, individuals transfers to investment accounts display a notable correlation with lagged stock returns, consistent with returns chasing. Such transfers roughly doubled around the onset of the COVID national emergency, alongside sharp declines in spending. Our findings imply that policies seeking to exert control over business cycles via the stock market may be successful over short time horizons. However, since stock market gains are associated with spending splurges on credit cards and flows into investment brokerage accounts, stimulus aimed at supporting asset prices can come with costs in the form of households financial vulnerability.

One way to gauge public sentiment regarding vaccines for the goal of increasing vaccination rates is by analyzing social media such as Twitter. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research was to understand public sentiment toward COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing discussions about the vaccines on social media for a period of 60 days when the vaccines were started in the United States. Using the combination of topic detection and sentiment analysis, we identified different types of concerns regarding vaccines that were expressed by different groups of the public on social media. METHODS: To better understand public sentiment, we collected tweets for exactly 60 days starting from December 16, 2020 that contained hashtags or keywords related to COVID-19 vaccines. We detected and analyzed different topics of discussion of these tweets as well as their emotional content. Vaccine topics were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization, and emotional content was identified using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis library as well as by using sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformer embeddings and comparing the embedding to different emotions using cosine similarity. RESULTS: After removing all duplicates and retweets, 7,948,886 tweets were collected during the 60-day time period. Topic modeling resulted in 50 topics; of those, we selected 12 topics with the highest volume of tweets for analysis. Administration and access to vaccines were some of the major concerns of the public. Additionally, we classified the tweets in each topic into 1 of the 5 emotions and found fear to be the leading emotion in the tweets, followed by joy. CONCLUSIONS: This research focused not only on negative emotions that may have led to vaccine hesitancy but also on positive emotions toward the vaccine. By identifying both positive and negative emotions, we were able to identify the public's response to the vaccines overall and to news events related to the vaccines.

This is generally attributed to efficient elimination of the infection from the brain coverings, i.e. the meninges, ependyma and chorioplexus, which are the primary targets of haematogeneous viral spread. How the immune system is able to purge these structures from viral infection with only minimal detrimental effects is still poorly understood. In the present work we studied how an attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can be cleared from the central nervous system in the absence of overt disease. We show that elimination of the virus from brain ependyma, but not from brain parenchyma, could be achieved by a T cell-dependent mechanism operating independently of major histocompatibility class I antigens and perforin. Considering that cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity is a leading cause of viral immunopathology and tissue damage, our findings may explain why the most common viral intruders of the central nervous system rarely represent a serious threat to our health.","output":"T cells can mediate viral clearance from ependyma but not from brain parenchyma in a major histocompatibility class I- and perforin-independent manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess the household income changes during COVID-19 pandemic among Japanese adults, and to evaluate how this was related to changes in dietary behaviors and food-related accessibility issues and information needs during the emergency period.MethodWe conducted an online cross-sectional survey in July, 2020 among residents (aged 20-69 years) of the 13 prefectures under special confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked about their dietary behaviors before the pandemic (before February 2020) and during the confinement period (April-May 2020), as well as about their food-related accessibility issues and information needs during the confinement period. Data from 2,225 residents were analyzed. Participants were divided into three groups (decreased, unchanged, and increased) based on the household income changes due to COVID-19. Demographics, dietary behaviors, and food-related accessibility issues and information needs were then compared among these three groups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the effect of household income changes on dietary behavior changes, food-related accessibility issues, and food-related information needs, while adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Furthermore, the effect of household income changes and subjective economic status were also analyzed using multiple logistic regression analyses.ResultThe participant distribution in each group were as follows: decreased (34.6%), unchanged (63.9%), and increased (1.6%). Higher proportion of those who were employed part-time, self-employed, or unemployed during the confinement period were found among the decreased group. The odds ratios (OR) of the decreased group were significantly higher than the unchanged group for lower frequency of eating out, and for higher frequency of home-cooking, consuming ready-to-eat convenience meals, and eating with children during the confinement period. Furthermore, regardless of the subjective economic status, the decreased group experienced difficulties in accessing required foods because of shortages and congestion in grocery stores, as well as increased prices. Additionally, food-related information needs regarding reduction of food expenses were also high among the decreased group.ConclusionParticipants with a decreased household income were more likely to experience difficulties with food accessibility and desire information about lowering food-related expenses. Furthermore, they reported lower frequency of eating out, and higher frequency of home-cooking and consuming ready-to-eat convenience meals during the confinement period than before the pandemic. Future studies should evaluate the direction (positive or negative) of these changed food consumption patterns.","output":"[Changes in dietary behaviors and food-related accessibility issues and information needs during the COVID-19 pandemic: comparison based on household economic status]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents results of a close textual analysis of the Review of Evolutionary Political Economys (REPEs) Editorial Manifesto (Cincotti et al.

In the process, it isolates six main objectives of the journal, including publishing papers on the big issues of the day using evolutionary themes; questions of integration and unification of schools and trends; studying the process of change through complex-systems, history and other methods; utilizing trans-, multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives; deepening international political economy (IPE) concerns within post-Keynesian and institutional schools; and scrutinizing differences between the schools and trends of evolutionary political economy (EPE). Ten proactive editorial proposals are made to mostly promote or in some cases adjust objectives. For instance, it suggests that special issues on big issues/problems apply especially EPE concepts and principles in some detail. It argues for papers on linkages between complexity theory and circular and cumulative causation. It encourages research on the positive and negative processes of innovation through the prism of the instrumental and ceremonial functions of technology and institutions. It suggests deepening an understanding of historical specificity and evolution vis--vis change and metamorphosis. It recommends scrutinizing the differences between trans-, multi- and interdisciplinary analyses; strengthening the IPE dimensions of all schools and trends of EPE; and encouraging papers on the emergent relationship between micro-meso-macro-global real world processes. It stresses the need to assess periodically the relative power of various schools and trends of EPE, and of publishing independent papers about editorial directions and problems. It outlines forms of editorial corruption of objectives and how they may be prevented or moderated, and proposes that objectives be kept firmly in mind when eliciting, refereeing and assessing awards, papers, symposia and special issues. Lastly it proposes the establishment of an independent Editorial Ombudsperson or committee for resolving disputes and anomalies; regular communication between REPE editors, boards and others on critical issues; and the publishing of yearly, five-yearly and decadal reviews and reports concerning progress with objectives for the journal.","output":"Objectives of the Review of Evolutionary Political Economys Manifesto and editorial proposals on world problems, complex systems, historico-institutional and corruption issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As much as the event following 9/11 triggered massive changes in our understanding of privacy rights and increased our level of acceptance of government infringement on individuals' freedom, the pandemic of the SARS-COV-2 is threatening to change our understanding of societal hierarchy and democratic process In this essay, we imagine a society where two classes, defined by their susceptibility to infection, emerge, and a neo-feudal system is established We suggest that it is possible to evaluate how likely a dystopian outcome is by using Machiavelli's understanding of the impact of the Plague on medieval Florence We also recommend following his advice to avoid such a drift by reaffirming the primacy of politics over scientism Copyright ? 2021 Andrea Molle","output":"SARS-COV-2 and the (Dark) future of society: A machiavellian approach to the end of body sovereignty and the beginning of bio-feudalism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Claire Wardle talks to Andria Azevedo Soares about the challenges faced in addressing false or misleading information about health.","output":"Claire Wardle: tackling the infodemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a global pandemic.

This aims to investigate the optimal management of UTUC during the pandemic by determining 1) Whether a three-month delay of RNU leads to worsened overall survival, 2) Whether radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) can be performed without prior diagnostic ureteroscopy (URS). METHODS: Consecutive patients with RNU performed for suspected UTUC in four hospitals in Hong Kong and Taiwan were included. Patients with histologically proven UTUC and with RNU performed within one year were dichotomized into early (3 months) and delayed (>3 months) RNU groups. Diagnostic performances of predictive models based on pre-URS factors (gross haematuria, suspicious or malignant urine cytology, and filling defect or contrast-enhancing mass on computed tomography), with or without URS, were analysed using receiver operating characteristics and area under curve (AUC). Overall survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2019, 665 patients underwent RNU, and 491 of them had prior diagnostic URS. The early RNU group had a better overall survival (P = 0.015). Early RNU was associated with a better overall survival upon multivariate analysis (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.03C2.33, P = 0.035). Large tumour size, multi-focal tumour, T2 or above disease, and positive nodal status were associated with a poorer overall survival. A combination of any 2 out of the 3 pre-URS factors achieved a positive predictive value of 99.5 to 100%. Presence of all 3 pre-URS factors achieved an AUC of 0.851 with URS, and AUC of 0.809 without URS. CONCLUSIONS: A delay of RNU for over 3 months was associated with poorer overall survival and has to be avoided despite the current COVID-19. We can also consider direct RNU based on clinical factors alone. This also avoids URS hospitalization and expedites the clinical pathway of UTUC.","output":"How to manage patients with suspected upper tract urothelial carcinoma in the pandemic of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although pork producers typically aim to optimize growth rates, occasionally it is necessary to slow growth, such as when harvest facility capacity is limited. In finishing pigs, numerous dietary strategies can be used to slow growth so pigs are at optimal slaughter body weights when harvest facility capacity and/or access is restored. However, the impact of these diets on pork carcass quality is largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of dietary strategies to slow growth in late finishing pigs and evaluate their effects on carcass composition and pork quality. Mixed-sex pigs (n = 897; 125  2 kg BW) were randomly allotted across 48 pens and assigned to 1 of 6 dietary treatments (n = 8 pens/treatment): (1) Control diet representative of a typical finisher diet (CON); (2) diet containing 3% calcium chloride (CaCl(2)); (3) diet containing 97% corn and no soybean meal (Corn); (4) diet deficient in isoleucine (LowIle); (5) diet containing 15% neutral detergent fiber (NDF) from soybean hulls (15% NDF); and (6) diet containing 20% NDF from soybean hulls (20% NDF). Over 42 d, pen body weights and feed disappearance were collected. Pigs were harvested in 3 groups (14, 28, and 42 d on feed) and carcass data collected. From the harvest group, 1 loin was collected from 120 randomly selected carcasses (20 loins/treatment) to evaluate pork quality traits. Overall, ADG was reduced in CaCl(2), Corn, and 20% NDF pigs compared with CON pigs (P < 0.001). However, ADFI was only reduced in CaCl(2) and 20% NDF pigs compared with CON (P < 0.001). Feed efficiency was reduced in CaCl(2) and Corn pigs compared with CON (P < 0.001). Hot carcass weights were reduced in CaCl(2) pigs at all harvest dates (P < 0.001) and were reduced in Corn and 20% NDF pigs at days 28 and 42 compared with CON pigs (P < 0.001). In general, CaCl(2) and 20% NDF diets resulted in leaner carcasses, whereas the Corn diet increased backfat by 42 d on test (P < 0.05). Loin pH was reduced and star probe increased in CaCl(2) pigs compared with CON pigs (P < 0.05); no treatments differed from CON pigs regarding drip loss, cook loss, color, firmness, or marbling (P  0.117). Overall, these data indicate that several dietary strategies can slow finishing pig growth without evidence of behavioral vices. However, changes to carcass composition and quality were also observed, indicating quality should be taken into consideration when choosing diets to slow growth.","output":"Nutritional approaches to slow late finishing pig growth: implications on carcass composition and pork quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To identify and address the challenges associated with the care of ACS patients during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.

Community-dwelling older adults (N = 419) completed questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, and social isolation, before the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of a cohort study, and during the lockdown period. The total scores of these questionnaires were compared across time. For the network analyses, partial correlation networks were constructed using items in the questionnaires as nodes, separately at both timepoints. Changes in edges, as well as nodal and bridge centrality were examined across time. Depression and anxiety symptoms, and social isolation had significantly increased during the lockdown. Significant changes were observed across time on several edges. Greater connectivity between the affective and social isolation nodes at lockdown was observed. Depression symptoms have become more tightly coupled across individuals, and so were the anxiety symptoms. Depression symptoms have also become slightly decoupled from those of anxiety. These changing network dynamics reflect the greater influence of social isolation on affective symptoms across individuals and an increased vulnerability to affective disorders. These findings provide novel perspectives and translational implications on the changing mental health context amidst a COVID-19 pandemic situation.","output":"COVID-19 lockdown has altered the dynamics between affective symptoms and social isolation among older adults: results from a longitudinal network analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen of public health concern, associated with a dramatic burden in places where the virus caused outbreaks between 2015 and 2017.

Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A -haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up.

This paper considers the hypothesis that viral binding to cell-surface integrins may contribute to the high infectivity and widespread extra-pulmonary impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This potential is suggested on the basis of the emergence of an RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) sequence in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. RGD is a motif commonly used by viruses to bind cell-surface integrins. Numerous signaling pathways are mediated by integrins and virion binding could lead to dysregulation of these pathways, with consequent tissue damage. Integrins on the surfaces of pneumocytes, endothelial cells and platelets may be vulnerable to CoV-2 virion binding. For instance, binding of intact virions to integrins on alveolar cells could enhance viral entry. Binding of virions to integrins on endothelial cells could activate angiogenic cell signaling pathways; dysregulate integrin-mediated signaling pathways controlling developmental processes; and precipitate endothelial activation to initiate blood clotting. Such a procoagulant state, perhaps together with enhancement of platelet aggregation through virions binding to integrins on platelets, could amplify the production of microthrombi that pose the threat of pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, strokes and other thrombotic consequences. The susceptibility of different tissues to virion-integrin interactions may be modulated by a host of factors, including the conformation of relevant integrins and the impact of the tissue microenvironment on spike protein conformation. Patient-specific differences in these factors may contribute to the high variability of clinical presentation. There is danger that the emergence of receptor-binding domain mutations that increase infectivity may also enhance access of the RGD motif for integrin binding, resulting in viral strains with ACE2 independent routes of cell entry and novel integrin-mediated biological and clinical impacts. The highly infectious variant, B.1.1.7 (or VUI 202012/01), includes a receptor-binding domain amino acid replacement, N501Y, that could potentially provide the RGD motif with enhanced access to cell-surface integrins, with consequent clinical impacts.","output":"Biological and Clinical Consequences of Integrin Binding via a Rogue RGD Motif in the SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 global pandemic leading to 3.5 million deaths worldwide as of June 2021. The human intestine was found to be a major viral target which could have a strong impact on virus spread and pathogenesis since it is one of the largest organs. While type I interferons (IFNs) are key cytokines acting against systemic virus spread, in the human intestine type III IFNs play a major role by restricting virus infection and dissemination without disturbing homeostasis. Recent studies showed that both type I and III IFNs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is not clear if one IFN controls SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human intestine better or with a faster kinetics. In this study, we could show that both type I and III IFNs possess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs), however type III IFN is more potent. Shorter type III IFN pretreatment times and lower concentrations were required to efficiently reduce virus load when compared to type I IFNs. Moreover, type III IFNs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 even 4 hours post-infection and induced a long-lasting antiviral effect in hIECs. Importantly, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to type III IFNs was virus-specific since type III IFN did not control VSV infection as efficiently. Together these results suggest that type III IFNs have a higher potential for IFN-based treatment of SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infection as compared to type I IFNs.","output":"Increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to type III interferon in human intestinal epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The honey crystallization is a frequent event and considered of major relevance as indicator of honey purity.

We aimed to assess the risk and incidence rate of documented SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a large cohort of laboratory-confirmed cases in Qatar. Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least one PCR positive swab that is []45 days after a first positive swab were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection, and classified as showing strong, good, some, or weak/no evidence for reinfection. Risk and incidence rate of reinfection were estimated. Results: Out of 133,266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 243 persons (0.18%) had at least one subsequent positive swab []45 days after the first positive swab. Of these, 54 cases (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection. Median time between first and reinfection swab was 64.5 days (range: 45-129).

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the impact of Japans state of emergency and stay-at-home policy for COVID-19 on hospital visits and disease exacerbation; we also identified related factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey (JACSIS), which included randomly sampled research agency panellists in Japan. Among the 28,000 participants, we included 7,747 respondents who reported having any disease. We described baseline characteristics and avoidance-related hospital visit outcomes. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to assess the association between chronic diseases and outcomes of hospital visit avoidance. RESULTS: Among 7,747 participants, 17.7% of patients with chronic diseases avoided hospital visits, 2.1% of patients postponed hospitalization or surgery, 4.9% of patients ran out of drug, and 5.3% of patients experienced disease exacerbation during the COVID-19 pandemic in April and May 2020.

They also provide a focus for detailed epidemiological studies and allow the timing and impact of interventions to be assessed. A common approach is to aggregate case data to administrative regions. Whilst providing a good visual impression of change over space, this method masks spatial variation and assumes that disease risk is constant across space. Risk factors for COVID-19 (e.g. population density, deprivation and ethnicity) vary from place to place across England so it follows that risk will also vary spatially. Kernel density estimation compares the spatial distribution of cases relative to the underlying population, unfettered by arbitrary geographical boundaries, to produce a continuous estimate of spatially varying risk. Using test results from healthcare settings in England (Pillar 1 of the UK Government testing strategy) and freely available methods and software, we estimated the spatial and spatio-temporal risk of COVID-19 infection across England for the first six months of 2020. Widespread transmission was underway when partial lockdown measures were introduced on the 23rd March 2020 and the greatest risk erred towards large urban areas. The rapid growth phase of the outbreak coincided with multiple introductions to England from the European mainland. The spatio-temporal risk was highly labile throughout. In terms of controlling transmission, the most important practical application is the accurate identification of areas within regions that may require tailored intervention strategies. We recommend that this approach is absorbed into routine surveillance outputs in England. Further risk characterisation using widespread community testing (Pillar 2) data is needed as is the increased use of predictive spatial models at fine spatial scales.","output":"The spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infection in England between January and June 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pediatric thromboembolism is a rare and heterogenous disease.

There have been some technical approaches to overcome language barriers in medical care but not yet in the prehospital emergency care setting. The use of digital technologies in health care is expanding rapidly. Involving end users at all stages of the development process may help to ensure such technologies are usable and can be implemented. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a digital communication tool that addresses paramedic needs in the specific circumstances of prehospital emergency care and helps paramedics to overcome language barriers when providing care to foreign-language patients. METHODS: We actively engaged paramedics and software designers in an action-oriented, participatory, iterative development process, which included field observations, workshops, background conversations, questionnaires on rescue missions, studying the literature, and preliminary testing in the field. RESULTS: With input from paramedics, we created an app with 600 fixed phrases supporting 18 languages. The app includes medical historyCtaking questions, phrases asking for consent, and phrases providing specific additional information. Children as patients, as well as their carers and other third parties, can be addressed with appropriate wording. All phrases can be played back audibly or displayed as text. The comprehensive content is grouped into categories and adapted to diverse scenarios, which makes the tool rapidly usable. The app includes a function to document patient responses and the conversation history. For evaluation in a clinical study, the app is run on a smartphone with extra speakers to be of use in noisy environments. The use of prototypes proved valuable to verify that the content, structure, and functions discussed in theory were of value and genuinely needed in practice and that the various device control elements were intuitive. CONCLUSIONS: The nature of the paramedic work environment places specific demands on the communication options used and need for such devices. The active involvement of paramedics in the development process allowed us to understand and subsequently consider their experience-based knowledge. Software designers could understand the paramedics work environment and consider respective needs in the menu navigation and design principles of the app. We argue that the development of any medical software product should actively involve both end users and developers in all phases of the development process. Providing the users with the opportunity to influence technology development ensures that the result is closer to their needs, which can be seen as crucial for successful implementation and sustainable use.

An enormous number of investigations point to the vital importance of various micronutrients in the interactions between the host immune system and viruses, including COVID-19. There are complex and multifaceted links among micronutrient status, the host immune response, and the virulence of pathogenic viruses. Micronutrients play a critical role in the coordinated recruitment of innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections, particularly in the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory host responses. Furthermore, inadequate amounts of micronutrients not only weaken the immune system in combating viral infections, but also contribute to the emergence of more virulent strains via alterations of the genetic makeup of the viral genome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the evidence that suggests the contribution of micronutrients in the spread as well as the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

Quality of evidence was evaluated using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus (defined as 80% agreement) was reached for 25 statements. RESULTS: The European consensus defined gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed GE in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms, with often coexisting postprandial distress syndrome symptoms of dyspepsia. The true epidemiology of gastroparesis is not known in detail, but diabetes, gastric surgery, certain neurological and connective tissue diseases, and the use of certain drugs recognized as risk factors. While the panel agreed that severely impaired gastric motor function is present in these patients, there was no consensus on underlying pathophysiology.

Taking consideration of the importance of PEDV orf3 gene, we have performed comprehensive analysis to investigate its synonymous codon usage patterns. In this study, the results of base composition analysis showed A/T rich and G/C poor in PEDV orf3 genes, and the most abundant base was nucleotide T. The relative synonymous codon usage value in each codon revealed that codon usage bias existed. The mean ENC value of each gene was 48.75, indicating a low codon usage bias, as well as a relatively instable change in PEDV orf3 genes. The general correlation analysis between base composition and codon usage bias indicated that mutational bias has an impact on the PEDV codon usage bias. Neutral analysis suggested that natural selection pressure takes a more important influence than mutational bias in shaping codon usage bias. Moreover, other factors including hydrophobicity and aromaticity have been also found to influence the codon usage variation among the PEDV orf3 genes.

The aim of this study was to ascertain patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient reported experienced measures (PREMs) of our service. Method The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) tool was used to assess the Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) of patients, and completed before and after attending our UDCC for treatment. Patients were also asked to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire. Results 146 patients were recruited for our study, with 95 patients completing the OHIP-14 questionnaires pre- and post intervention at our UDCC and 136 patients completing a patient satisfaction questionnaire. A statistically significant reduction in OHIP score when comparing pre- and post intervention was found across all 14 OHIP domains. The mean positive response rate (strongly agree or agree) for the patient satisfaction questionnaire was 97.1%. Conclusion A significant improvement in OHRQoL was found after treatment at our UDCC, with the majority of patients reporting a positive experience. We conclude that PROMs and PREMs are vital tools to assess service efficacy, help with the planning of service provision and should remain at the forefront even during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Assessing the impact of an Urgent Dental Care Centre on the Oral Health-Related Quality of life of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Prior studies have shown the presence of immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) in endothelial cells and eccrine epithelium of acral perniosis classified as \\"COVID toes\\". Yet, other studies have been unable to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in skin biopsies of \\"COVID toes\\" by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. OBJECTIVE In order to address these apparently conflicting findings, we compared detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP, through RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) vs immunohistochemistry (IHC), in skin biopsies of acral perniotic lesions presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Three of six cases showed positive immunohistochemical labeling of endothelial cells, with 1 of 3 cases with sufficient depth also having labeling of eccrine glands, using an anti-SP SARS-CoV-2 antibody. These three cases positive with IHC were negative for SP by RNA ISH. CONCLUSION While the gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissue sections has yet to be determined, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP alone without spike RNA suggests cleaved SP may be present in cutaneous endothelial cells and eccrine epithelium, providing a potential pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19 endotheliitis.

Subsequently, the granules containing ASP are converted to spherules and then to Ethyl cellulose (EC) Coated spherules (CS) by a novel bed coating during the rolling (BCDR) process. Among spherules, one with 0.35 mm than 0.71 mm shows required properties.

In relation to this, human resources for disaster activities must be secured. To achieve a stable supply of human resources, it is essential to improve the intentions of individuals responding to each type of disaster. However, the current intention of Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) members has not yet been assessed. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To facilitate a smooth disaster response, this survey aimed to assess the intention to engage in each type of disaster activity among DMAT members. METHODS: An anonymous web questionnaire survey was conducted. Japanese DMAT members in the nuclear disaster-affected area (Group A; n = 79) and the non-affected area (Group N; n = 99) were included in the analysis. The outcome was the answer to the following question: Will you actively engage in activities during natural, human-made, and chemical (C), biological (B), radiological/nuclear (R/N), and explosive (E) (CBRNE) disasters? Then, questionnaire responses were compared according to disaster type. RESULTS: The intention to engage in C (50), B (47), R/N (58), and E (52) disasters was significantly lower than that in natural (82) and human-made (82) disasters (P <.001). The intention to engage in CBRNE disasters among younger participants (age 39 years) was significantly higher in Group A than in Group N. By contrast, the intention to engage in R/N disasters alone among older participants (age 40 years) was higher in Group A than in Group N. However, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of intention to engage in C, B, and E disasters. Moreover, the intention to engage in all disasters between younger and older participants in Group A did not differ. In Group N, older participants had a significantly higher intention to engage in B and R/N disasters. CONCLUSION: Experience with a specific type of calamity at a young age may improve intention to engage in not only disasters encountered, but also other types. In addition, the intention to engage in CBRNE disasters improved with age in the non-experienced population. To respond smoothly to specific disasters in the future, measures must be taken to improve the intention to engage in CBRNE disasters among DMAT members.","output":"Survey about Intention to Engage in Specific Disaster Activities among Disaster Medical Assistance Team Members"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Remdesivir is widely used for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but controversies regarding its efficacy still remain. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effect of remdesivir on clinical and virologic outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients from June to July 2020. Primary clinical endpoints included clinical recovery, additional mechanical ventilator (MV) support, and duration of oxygen or MV support. Viral load reduction by hospital day (HD) 15 was evaluated by calculating changes in cycle threshold (Ct) values. RESULTS: A total of 86 severe COVID-19 patients were evaluated including 48 remdesivir-treated patients. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. Remdesivir was administered an average of 7.42 days from symptom onset. The proportions of clinical recovery of the remdesivir and supportive care group at HD 14 (56.3% and 39.5%) and HD 28 (87.5% and 78.9%) were not statistically different. The proportion of patients requiring MV support by HD 28 was significantly lower in the remdesivir group than in the supportive care group (22.9% vs. 44.7%, P = 0.032), and MV duration was significantly shorter in the remdesivir group (average, 1.97 vs. 5.37 days; P = 0.017).

Although several large scale decontamination methods have been proposed (hydrogen peroxide vapor, UV-C); many of them are not applicable in remote and low resource settings. Heat with humidity has been demonstrated as a promising decontamination approach, but care must be taken when implementing this method at a grassroots level. Here we present a simple method to provide stable humidity and temperature for individual N95 masks which can be simply scaled in low resource settings. Moist heat (>50% humidity, 65-80C temperature) was applied to Kimberly-Clark N95 respirators for over 30 minutes by placing sealed containers with N95 respirators into water that had been brought to a rolling boil and removed from heat, and then allowing the containers to sit for over 45 minutes. After rising to their threshold points, temperature and humidity remained above 65C and 50% for a treatment time of at least 30 minutes. Filtration efficiency of 0.3-4.99um particles remained above 97% after 5 treatment cycles across all particle size sub-ranges, which is consistent with previously-reported data for similar heat and humidity conditions on different N95 FFR models. Although no fit tests were conducted on these masks after treatment, prior data on moist heat based treatment indicates consistent fit for up to five cycles of decontamination. This method of applying heat and humidity for the purpose of N95 respirator decontamination can be implemented on open flame stoves for low resource settings without reliable electricity access or where other methods of decontamination are not accessible. Higher temperatures or longer treatment times, such as treatment at >70C for over 30 minutes, could be achieved by increasing the volumes of boiled water used. Although fresh N95 masks should always be used - whenever available - we believe this simple yet reliable method provides a low cost, electricity free method for N95 decontamination in remote parts of the world.","output":"Applying Heat and Humidity using Stove Boiled Water for Decontamination of N95 Respirators in Low Resource Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Silence became one of the important aspects of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 is asymptomatic for some individuals and for others it can cause symptoms ranging from flu-like to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and death. Although it is anticipated that an effective vaccine will be available to protect against COVID-19, at present the world is relying on social distancing and hygiene measures and repurposed drugs. There is a worldwide effort to develop an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and, as of late August 2020, there are 30 vaccines in clinical trials with over 200 in various stages of development. This review will focus on the eight vaccine candidates that entered Phase 1 clinical trials in mid-May, including AstraZeneca/Oxford's AZD1222, Moderna's mRNA-1273 and Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccines, which are currently in advanced stages of vaccine development. In addition to reviewing the different stages of vaccine development, vaccine platforms and vaccine candidates, this review also discusses the biological and immunological basis required of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the importance of a collaborative international effort, the ethical implications of vaccine development, the efficacy needed for an immunogenic vaccine, vaccine coverage, the potential limitations and challenges of vaccine development. Although the demand for a vaccine far surpasses the production capacity, it will be beneficial to have a limited number of vaccines available for the more vulnerable population by the end of 2020 and for the rest of the global population by the end of 2021.","output":"A Review of the Progress and Challenges of Developing a Vaccine for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV2 virus has gripped the whole world with overwhelming strain in our health system. Currently, there are no standard guidelines in its treatment but the possible benefits of convalescent plasma in limiting complications and severity of the COVID-19 disease have emerged. OBJECTIVEThis study aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of using convalescent plasma in improving the clinical course of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease admitted at University of Santo Tomas and Makati Medical Center. METHODSThis study is a quasi-experimental (prospective analytical), and multi-center study involving 65 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 Disease who received convalescent plasma, with 65 patients who only received best available treatment serving as age-gender-matched control. RESULTSMedian age of the population who received convalescent plasma was 60 years old, mostly male (68%), and manifested severe pneumonia (47%). There was noted statistically signifcant decrease between the pre-and post-treatment values of hemoglobin (p=0.04) and LDH (p=0.086). There was also statistically significant increase in platelet counts (p=0.01). WBC and PaO2 increased while ferritin and PFR decreased after convalescent plasma transfusion, however, these were not statistically significant. Length of stay and clinical outcome of those who received convalescent plasma were then compared to age-gender matched controls who only received best available treatment. There was noted statistically significant difference between length of stay (p=0.00) among those who received convalescent plasma as compared to those who did not. This was seen across severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. There was also more mortality seen in the best available treatment alone group, but this was non-significant. CONCLUSIONSConvalescent plasma use showed no significant impact in the recovery rate and outcome of patients who received it as compared to those who did not, however, its use was proven to be safe among all patients regardless of the level of severity and clinical profile.","output":"Use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy with Best Available Treatment (BAT) among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Multi-Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Indian sub-continent COVID-19 second wave started in early March 2021 and its effect was more lethal than the first wave, the confirmed cases and the death rate was higher than in the first wave.

There is a need for establishing an animal model that would facilitate experimental research on the technique. The aim of the present study was to describe a safe and efficient laparoscopic technique of 70% partial hepatectomy in the rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four male Wistar rats underwent either laparoscopic (group LAP-HEP) or open resection of the median and left lateral hepatic lobes (group HEP). In group LAP-HEP, a 5-mm Hg pneumoperitoneum was established. Three 5-mm trocars were introduced in the abdominal cavity. A self-made pretied ligature loop was used to ligate en bloc the pedicles of the hepatic lobes to be resected. A self-made sterile elastic specimen retrieval bag facilitated extraction of the resected liver tissue. In group HEP, the same liver lobes were resected by ligation of their pedicles after midline laparotomy. RESULTS The percentage of resected liver parenchyma did not differ between groups. All animals returned to normal feeding activity by 48 h postoperation and had no complications.

This tenuous shortage may touch various aspects but in the first place it will affect isolation and cohorting. In addition, this shortage will not only apply to acutely ill children with viral respiratory tract infections but all children with need for hospital care, either chronically ill or e.g. being premature babies or newborns. Therefore, approaches are required which on the one hand are based on pragmatic grounds but on the other hand fulfill the basics of hygiene and infection control. The recommendations proposed in this statement are intended to give assistance to hospitals for the management of testing, isolation and cohorting of pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. The most important factor navigating the essential measures is the cumulative incidence of newly diagnosed infections per 100,000 over the last 7 days, which is given by the RKI or the local public health authorities. In the situation of low (<25/100,000) or medium (25-50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and hospital admission can be performed under standard hygiene precautions and the children will be cohorted according to their clinical presentation until the results of SARS-CoV-2 test (or RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] or influenza test) are available. In the situation of high (>50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and the admission have to be performed under SARS-CoV-2 precautions as specified by the RKI, and the children have to be isolated until the results of SARS-CoV-2 test are available. The assessment of the incidence figures and the respective measures may be adapted by the local public health authorities on an individual basis. In case of shortfalls in admission capacities, the requirement of acute emergency care may necessitate that isolation and cohorting in the hospital will have to be performed temporarily in a less restrictive way than recommended here for standard.","output":"[Children with acute respiratory tract infections in pediatric hospitals in autumn/winter 2020/2021]./ Kinder mit akuter Atemwegsinfektion in Kinderkliniken im Herbst/Winter 2020/21: Empfehlungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft fr P?diatrische Infektiologie (DGPI) und der Deutschen Gesellschaft fr Krankenhaushygiene (DGKH) (Stand 14.10.2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated physiological and behavioral responses associated with the onset of neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) in calves experimentally infected with rotavirus and assessed the suitability of these responses as early disease indicators. The suitability of infrared thermography (IRT) as a noninvasive, automated method for early disease detection was also assessed. Forty-three calves either (1) were experimentally infected with rotavirus (n = 20) or (2) acted as uninfected controls (n = 23). Health checks were conducted on a daily basis to identify when calves presented overt clinical signs of disease. In addition, fecal samples were collected to verify NCD as the cause of illness. Feeding behavior was recorded continuously as calves fed from an automated calf feeder, and IRT temperatures were recorded once per day across 5 anatomical locations using a hand-held IRT camera. Lying behavior was recorded continuously using accelerometers. Drinking behavior at the water trough was filmed continuously to determine the number and duration of visits. Respiration rate was recorded once per day by observing flank movements. The effectiveness of inoculating calves with rotavirus was limited because not all calves in the infected group contracted the virus; further, an unexpected outbreak of Salmonella during the trial led to all calves developing NCD, including those in the healthy control group. Therefore, treatment was ignored and instead each calf was analyzed as its own control, with data analyzed with respect to when each calf displayed clinical signs of disease regardless of the causative pathogen. Milk consumption decreased before clinical signs of disease appeared. The IRT temperatures were also found to change before clinical signs of disease appeared, with a decrease in shoulder temperature and an increase in side temperature. There were no changes in respiration rate or lying time before clinical signs of disease appeared. However, the number of lying bouts decreased and lying bout duration increased before and following clinical signs of disease. There was no change in the number of visits to the water trough, but visit duration increased before clinical signs of disease appeared. Results indicate that milk consumption, IRT temperatures of the side and shoulder, number and duration of lying bouts, and duration of time spent at the water trough show potential as suitable early indicators of disease.","output":"Physiological and behavioral responses as indicators for early disease detection in dairy calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is diagnosed at an advanced (unresectable or metastatic) tumor stage in approximately one-third of cases. This is partly due to the non-specific symptomatology and limitations in endoscopic and radiologic detection methods. In this context, the prognosis remains poor and systemic chemotherapy appears to benefit patients when compared to best supportive care alone, despite the absence of randomized controlled trials. The results of a recent large prospective cohort (ARCAD-NADEGE) reported that the absence of chemotherapy was a predictive factor for a lower overall survival (OS) even though poor differentiation and SBA associated with Crohn's disease correlate with poor prognosis. In retrospective series, the median OS ranges from approximately 9 to 18 months with current treatment approaches. A combination of a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX or CAPOX) appears to be the most utilized and effective first-line chemotherapy regimen. Other front-line alternatives are the combination of 5-FU and cisplatin or fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). In second-line, FOLFIRI is an effective option after progression on platinum-based therapy. Taxane-based therapy appears to be an alternative option, but further evaluation in larger series is needed. To a limited extent, the role of surgical resection for metastatic disease appears to be a valid option, though this approach has not been evaluated in prospective clinical studies. Due to the rareness of the disease, inclusion in clinical trials should be prioritized, and there is hope that targeted therapies and immunotherapy may enter the therapeutic arsenal for these patients.","output":"Therapeutic Strategies for Patients with Advanced Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma: Current Knowledge and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, a continental-sized country, considered as an emerging economy but with several regional nuances, focusing on the availability of human resources, especially for intensive care units. METHODS: The database of the National Registry of Health Facilities was accessed. Healthcare professionals in the care of COVID-19 were georeferenced. We correlated the number of professionals with the parameters used by the World Health Organization. According to the Brazilian Intensive Care Medicine Association, we correlated the data for adult intensive care unit beds in each state with the number of professionals for each ten intensive care unit beds. The number of professionals, beds, and cases were then organized by state. RESULTS: The number of physicians per 100 thousand inhabitants followed the World Health Organization recommendations; however, the number of nurses did not. The number of intensivists, registered nurses, nurse technicians specialized in intensive care, and respiratory therapists, necessary for every ten intensive care beds, was not enough for any of these professional categories. A complete team of critical care specialists was available for 10% of intensive care unit beds in Brazil. CONCLUSION: There is a shortage of professionals for intensive care unit, as we demonstrated for Brazil. Intensive care physical resources to be efficiently used require extremely specialized human resources; therefore, planning human resources is just as crucial as planning physical and structural resources.","output":"Who is going to turn on the ventilators?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we study long-range site percolation on square and simple cubic lattices with various combinations of nearest neighbors, up to the eighth neighbors for the square lattice and the ninth neighbors for the simple cubic lattice.

The North-west region experienced two notable waves, with the peak of the first wave coinciding with the start of a 4 week school holiday (September-October'09). In the southern region the two waves were less clear cut, though again the first peak of the first wave coincided with the start of school holidays--albeit of less than 2 weeks duration (August'09). Our analysis suggests that the school holidays had a significant influence on the epidemiology of the 2009 pandemic in India. We estimate that school holidays reduced the reproduction number by 14-27% in different regions of India, relative to levels seen outside holiday periods. The estimates of the reproduction number obtained (with peak R values below 1.5) are compatible with those reported from other regions of the world. This work reinforces past studies showing the significant impact of school holidays on spread of 2009 pandemic virus, and by inference the role of contact patterns in children on transmission.","output":"Transmission dynamics of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in India: the impact of holiday-related school closure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we report that palladium(0) complexes can coordinate in a ?2 fashion to 1,3-dienes and significantly raise the energy of their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) by donating the electrons from the d-orbitals to the empty antibonding molecular orbitals of double bonds (&#960;*) via back-bonding.

We aim to establish a gold standard of care by systematically analysing symptom clusters and current practices, iteratively improving pathways and systems of care, and working to disseminate better practices. Methods and analysisThis mixed-method, multi-site study is informed by the principles of applied health services research, quality improvement, co-design, and learning health systems. It was developed in close partnership with patients (whose stated priorities are prompt clinical assessment; evidence-based advice and treatment; and help with returning to work and other roles) and with front-line clinicians. Workstreams and tasks to optimise assessment, treatment and monitoring are based in three contrasting settings: [1] specialist management in 10 long COVID clinics across the UK, via a quality improvement collaborative, experience-based co-design and targeted efforts to reduce inequalities of access; [2] patient self-management at home, with technology-supported monitoring; and [3] generalist management in primary care, harnessing electronic record data to study population phenotypes and develop evidence-based decision support, referral pathways and prioritisation criteria across the primary-secondary care interface, along with analysis of costs.

Paramount to the care of affected patients is the delivery of lung-protective mechanical ventilation which prioritizes tidal volume and plateau pressure limitation. Lung protection can probably be further enhanced by scaling target tidal volumes to the specific respiratory mechanics of individual patients. The best procedure for selecting optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS remains uncertain; several relevant issues must be considered when selecting PEEP, particularly lung recruitability. Noninvasive ventilation must be used with caution in ARDS as excessively high respiratory drive can further exacerbate lung injury; newer modes of delivery offer promising approaches in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Airway pressure release ventilation offers an alternative approach to maximize lung recruitment and oxygenation, but clinical trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit of this mode over conventional ventilation strategies. Rescue therapy with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is an important option in refractory hypoxemia. Despite a disappointing lack of benefit (and possible harm) in patients with moderate or severe ARDS, possibly due to lung hyperdistention and right ventricular dysfunction, high-frequency oscillation may improve outcome in patients with very severe hypoxemia.","output":"Optimal Ventilator Strategies in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet access and the availability of digital devices in classrooms have been growing exponentially.

Refugees living in camp settings are particularly vulnerable to infection because of the difficulty implementing preventive measures and lack of medical resources. However, very little is known about the factors that influence the behavioural response of refugees towards COVID-19. There is an urgent need for field evidence to inform the design and implementation of a robust social and behaviour change communication strategy to respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 in humanitarian settings. This study examines factors influencing COVID-19-related behavioural decisions in the Nguenyyiel refugee camp located in Gambella, Ethiopia using data collected from focus group discussions and key informant interviews in September 2020. The evidence suggests that while a number of factors have been facilitating the adoption of COVID-19 prevention measures, including good general knowledge about the virus and the necessary preventive strategies and the active engagement by community leaders and non-governmental organisations, important structural and cultural factors have hindered the uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures. These include: difficultly staying at home to minimise physical contact; overcrowding in the camp and within home dwellings; a lack of hand sanitizers and masks and of funds to purchase these; inconsistent use of facemasks when available; COVID-19 denial and misconceptions about the disease, and other cultural beliefs and habits. Overall, the study found that refugees perceived COVID-19 to pose a low threat (susceptibility and severity) and had mixed beliefs about the efficacy of preventive behaviours. This study identified gaps in the existing information education and communication strategy, including a lack of consistency, inadequate messaging, and a limited use of communication channels. While awareness of COVID-19 is a necessary first step, it is not sufficient to increase adoption of prevention measures in this setting. The current communication strategy should move beyond awareness raising and emphasise the threat posed by COVID-19 especially among the most vulnerable members of the camp population. This should be accompanied by increased community support and attention to other barriers and incentives to preventive behaviours.","output":"This Is Not Our Disease: A Qualitative Study of Influencers of COVID-19 Preventive Behaviours in Nguenyyiel Refugee Camp (Gambella, Ethiopia)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Its impact on patients with comorbidities is clearly related to fatality cases, and diabetes has been linked to one of the most important causes of severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients Substantial research progress has been made on COVID-19 therapeutics;however, effective treatments remain unsatisfactory This unmet clinical need is robustly associated with the complexity of pathophysiological mechanisms described for COVID-19 Several key lung pathophysiological mechanisms promoted by SARS-CoV-2 have driven the response in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic subjects There is sufficient evidence that glucose metabolism pathways in the lung are closely tied to bacterial proliferation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and pro-thrombotic responses, which lead to severe clinical outcomes It is also likely that SARS-CoV-2 proliferation is affected by glucose metabolism of type I and type II cells This review summarizes the current understanding of pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung of diabetic patients and highlights the changes in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions","output":"Pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Lung of Diabetic Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the potential pathogens in patients with COVID-19 that we should pay more attention to is Aspergillosis, as pulmonary Aspergillosis is a critical complication of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, especially those with severe pneumonia.

Methods We conducted a proof-of-concept, dose-escalation, open-label, randomised-controlled vaccine trial (IDSCOVA) in healthy adults aged 18-30 years. To test initial safety, ten participants received 10 g mRNA-1273 vaccine through intradermal injection at day 1 and 29. Following a favourable safety review, thirty participants were 1:1 randomised to receive 20 g mRNA-1273 either intradermally or intramuscularly. The primary endpoint was tolerability and safety. The secondary endpoint was seroconversion and specific IgG concentration against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) after the second dose at day 43. We compared results to two historical cohorts of non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. Findings Thirty-eight of forty included participants (median age 25 years) completed the study. There were no serious adverse events. Self-reported local adverse reactions after intradermal delivery were mild, both in the 10 g and the 20 g group. In the higher dose group, systemic adverse reactions were more common, but still well tolerated. All 38 participants mounted substantially higher IgG-anti-S1 and IgG-anti-RBD concentrations at day 43 than COVID-19 controls. At day 43, anti-S1 (95% CI) was 1,696 (1,309-2,198) BAU/mL for the 10 g intradermal group, 1,406 (953.5-2,074) BAU/mL for the 20 g intramuscular group and 2,057 (1,421-2,975) BAU/mL for the 20 g intradermal group.

Various studies have shown ocular manifestation in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. We aimed to identify ophthalmic manifestations in COVID-19 patients and establish an association between ocular symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library was conducted for publications from December 2019 to April 2021. The search included MeSH terms such as SARS-CoV-2 and ocular manifestations. The pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using binomial distribution and random effects. The meta-regression method was used to examine factors affecting heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: Of the 412 retrieved articles, 23 studies with a total of 3,650 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. The PPE for any ocular manifestations was 23.77% (95% CI: 15.73-31.81). The most prevalent symptom was dry eyes with a PPE of 13.66% (95% CI: 5.01-25.51). The PPE with 95% CI for conjunctival hyperemia, conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis, and ocular pain was 13.41% (4.65-25.51), 9.14% (6.13-12.15), and 10.34% (4.90-15.78), respectively.

What happens to housework and childcare responsibilities when women and men are required to work from home due to an abrupt lockdown? Who is doing the housework and childcare? Who should be responsible for unpaid domestic work? What are the factors that affect men's share in housework and childcare'? This paper reports the early results of an online survey conducted on Malaysian men and women during the nationwide imposed lockdown in May 2020. In addition, it discusses how the pandemic affected unpaid housework and childcare time and responsibilities in Malaysia. The findings suggest that women spend more time on housework and childcare than men and are responsible for most unpaid domestic work during COVID-19. These findings are consistent with those obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also suggest that the time availability perspective affects men's share in housework and that the relative resources perspective affects their share in childcare during COVID-l9.

Researchers have made significant strides in discovering molecular insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and developing vaccines, but there is still no successful cure for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The present study has proposed a drug-repositioning pipeline for the design and discovery of an effective fungal-derived bioactive metabolite as a drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Fungal derivative \\"Cordycepin\\" was selected for this study to investigate the inhibitory properties against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (PDB ID: 6M71) of SARS-CoV-2. The pharmacological profile, intermolecular interactions, binding energy, and stability of the compound were determined utilizing cheminformatic approaches. Subsequently, molecular dynamic simulation was performed to better understand the binding mechanism of cordycepin to RdRp. RESULTS: The pharmacological data and retrieved molecular dynamics simulations trajectories suggest excellent drug-likeliness and greater structural stability of cordycepin, while the catalytic residues (Asp760, Asp761), as well as other active site residues (Trp617, Asp618, Tyr619, Trp800, Glu811) of RdRp, showed better stability during the overall simulation span. CONCLUSION: Promising results of pharmacological investigation along with molecular simulations revealed that cordycepin exhibited strong inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 polymerase enzyme (RdRp).

Physicians managing immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) must complete special authorization (SA) and prescription renewal (Rx) forms for patients on biologic therapy. This adds significant administrative burden potentially leading to delays in therapy initiation and care continuity. Historically, document completion has largely been paper-based, with forms faxed between patient support programs (PSPs) and physician offices. The use of secure electronic document signing (SEDS) platforms during the pandemic has allowed physicians to receive and complete documents digitally. The aim of the project was to evaluate the impact of SEDS-based biologic documentation on clinical practice in order to 1) Determine if the use of SEDS platforms increased timeliness of document returns compared to traditional workflows 2) Assess whether SEDS usage is acceptable and sustainable and 3) Assess MD satisfaction with SEDS platforms. Methods: This was a retrospective audit of SEDS and paper-based biologic document workflows from a single PSP (Abbvie Care). Outcomes of interest were the number of documents completed monthly using SEDS, new monthly users, and the number of active monthly users between April 1, 2020-March 31, 2021. Time (days) to SEDS completion (vs. paper process) was determined by reviewing timepoint data for SA and Rx documents from May 2019-January 2020 ('pre- SEDS') and for SEDS documents from May 2020-January 2021('SEDS'). The return time (RT) was defined as the time between date sent to a physician's office by the PSP to the date returned to the PSP. Documents in the pre- SEDS cohort with a RT exceeding 30 days were excluded. Results: In total, 5573 SA and Rx documents were completed by 383 physicians using the SEDS platform from April 2020-March 2021. A mean of 14.6 (sd 21.8) documents were signed per physician. The number of monthly electronic documents processed increased from 104 in April 2020 to 800 in March 2021. Active monthly users increased from 24 in April 2020 to 213 in March 2021 (31 new users monthly). A total of 19,387 paper documents were processed during the 'pre-SEDS' period and 3,317 electronic documents processed in the 'SEDS' period. The mean RT in the 'pre- SEDS' period was 8.03 days (sd 8.2) and the 'SEDS' period was 1.11 days (sd 2.6). Conclusion: This data demonstrates acceptability, appropriateness, and improved processing efficiency of an SEDS platform improving timeliness of patient care.

However, evidence on how pandemic-related risk factors contribute to changes in these outcomes is lacking. Aims We sought to examine how different adverse experiences and worries about adversity brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the pandemic. Method Data from 48,446 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed across the first 45 weeks (1 April to 7 February 2021) of the pandemic. Fixed effects regressions explored associations between weekly within-person variation in five categories of adversity experiences and adversity worries with changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours across age groups (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+ years). Results More adverse experiences were more strongly related to outcomes than worries. Specific categories of worries and adversities had stronger associations with outcomes than others. The largest contributing factor to increases in both self-harm thoughts (odds ratio (OR) range = 3.38 to 4.00) and behaviours (OR range = 3.72 to 6.82) was physical or psychological abuse amongst all ages. Having had COVID-19 and financial worries were associated with increased likelihood of both outcomes, the latter being more consistently associated with outcomes than actual financial adversity. Conclusions These findings suggest that a significant portion of UK adults may be at increased risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours during the pandemic, which is concerning given the link between self-harm and suicide. Policies currently place to protect and reassure citizens may be insufficient in assuaging fears and anxieties. Given the likelihood that as time goes on, the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will accumulate, policy makers can begin adapting a variety of existing evidence-based suicide prevention strategies and other social policies to help mitigate its consequences.","output":"Factors influencing self-harm thoughts and self-harm behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a longitudinal analysis of 48,446 adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between perceived organizational support (POS) and COVID\\\\19 vaccination intention as well as the influence of the implementation of workplace infection prevention measures.

RESULTS: Of the 23 846 participants in this survey, 1958 (8%) reported very high POS. In the group with very high POS, 836 (43%) workers wanted the COVID\\\\19 vaccination; in contrast 1382 (36%) workers in the group with very low POS wanted the vaccination. POS was associated with COVID\\\\19 vaccination intention (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11). The OR decreased after additional adjustment for the number of workplace infection control measures (OR = 1.06). In the analysis with POS as a categorical variable, very high POS was associated with COVID\\\\19 vaccination intention (reference: very low POS) (OR = 1.34).

Initially, the binding site of COVID-19 main protease was predicted which located between regions 2 and 3. Structure-based virtual screening was performed through a hierarchal mode of elimination technique after generating a grid box. This led to the identification of five top hit molecules that were selected on the basis of docking score and visualization of non-bonding interactions. The docking results revealed that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are the major contributing factors in the stabilization of complexes. The docking scores were found between -7.524 and -6.711 kcal/mol indicating strong ligand-protein interactions. Amino acid residues Phe140, Leu141, Gly143, Asn142, Thr26, Glu166 and Thr190 (hydrogen bonding interactions) and Phe140, Cys145, Cys44, Met49, Leu167, Pro168, Met165, Val42, Leu27 and Ala191 (hydrophobic interactions) formed the binding pocket of COVID-19 main protease.

A total of 97 (85.8%) patients were diagnosed with definite PNS according to the 2004 criteria: only 42.3% (41/97) fulfilled the 2021 criteria, while the remaining 40, 14, and 2 re-diagnosed with probable PNS, possible PNS, and non-PNS. The requirement of cancers consistent with antibody and phenotype increased the specificity and thus greatly enhanced the accuracy of the 2021 criteria. Conclusion: The updated criteria for PNS emphasized the consistency between cancer phenotype and antibody and showed a better diagnostic value. A better diagnostic yield could benefit disease management.","output":"Evaluation of the Updated Diagnostic Criteria for Paraneoplastic Neurologic Syndromes in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interest in the use of simulation for acquiring, maintaining, and assessing skills in GI endoscopy has grown over the past decade, as evidenced by recent American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines encouraging the use of endoscopy simulation training and its incorporation into training standards by a key accreditation organization. An EndoVators Summit, partially supported by a grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health, (NIH) was held at the ASGE Institute for Training and Technology from November 19 to 20, 2017. The summit brought together over 70 thought leaders in simulation research and simulator development and key decision makers from industry. Proceedings opened with a historical review of the role of simulation in medicine and an outline of priority areas related to the emerging role of simulation training within medicine broadly. Subsequent sessions addressed the summit's purposes: to review the current state of endoscopy simulation and the role it could play in endoscopic training, to define the role and value of simulators in the future of endoscopic training and to reach consensus regarding priority areas for simulation-related education and research and simulator development. This white paper provides an overview of the central points raised by presenters, synthesizes the discussions on the key issues under consideration, and outlines actionable items and/or areas of consensus reached by summit participants and society leadership pertinent to each session. The goal was to provide a working roadmap for the developers of simulators, the investigators who strive to define the optimal use of endoscopy-related simulation and assess its impact on educational outcomes and health care quality, and the educators who seek to enhance integration of simulation into training and practice.","output":"ASGE EndoVators Summit: simulators and the future of endoscopic training."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is little information on how to prioritize testis cancer (TC) patients' care during COVID-19 pandemic in order to relieve its pressure on the health care systems. OBJECTIVE: To describe the recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with TC amidst COVID- 19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pubmed search and review of the main urological association guidelines on TC. RESULTS: The biology of TC requires immediate care of patients during diagnosis, initial surgical therapy and management of recurrent disease. Active surveillance is the first choice of management and should be offered to all compliant clinical stage I TC patients provided they understand the need to self-isolate. Active surveillance may also help decrease the demand for intensive care unit beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and other critical hospital and human resources by minimizing surgeries without compromising patient outcomes. Complications of therapy and symptomatic patients represent medical emergencies and should be treated immediately. Telemedicine may be useful during follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS: Most stages of testis cancer require urgent care; however, all recommendations must be adapted to local health care priorities considering that most of these patients are at low risk of severe COVID-19 infection.","output":"Priorities in testis cancer care during Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Tocilizumab (TCZ) is an anti-interleukin-6 antibody that has been used to treat patients with 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Numerous retrospective studies have shown beneficial treatment efficacy. Several recent randomized clinical trials have questioned the efficacy of TCZ in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab recently used for treating patients with COVID-19. Methods: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and comparative studies that compared the outcomes between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were analysed. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (inception to November 20, 2020) were systematically searched. Primary outcomes included mortality and the rate of requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV). In addition, several subgroup analyses stratified by disease severity, publication type and TCZ administration were performed. Results: Three RCTs, twenty-one cohort studies and nine case-control studies including 11,206 patients were finally included. The TCZ group included 2,794 patients (24.93%) and the SOC group included 8,412 patients (75.07%). The mortality rate (>14 days) of the TCZ group, 29.63% (590/1,991), was lower than the SOC group, 41.51% (2,380/5,734) (OR 0.64, 0.57 to 0.73;p <0.00001). However, no significant difference in-14-day mortality rates was observed between the two groups (13.53% vs 22.92%, p = 0.21). Meanwhile, the rate of MV was significantly decreased in the TCZ group compared with the SOC group (OR 0.42, 0.22 to 0.83;p = 0.01). According to the results of the subgroup analysis stratified by disease severity, TCZ only reduced the mortality rate for critical patients with COVID-19 compared with SOC (OR 0.60, 0.52 to 0.71;P < 0.00001), particularly for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) or patients requiring MV. No statistically significant increase was recognized in the rates of secondary infections or thrombosis between the two groups. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that the addition of tocilizumab to the SOC might reduce mortality after 14 days in patients with COVID-19, particularly critical patients requiring MV. More extensive RCTs with longer follow-up periods are needed to validate these findings.","output":"Efficacy and Safety of Tocilizumab in Patients with COVID-19 : A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet-of-Things systems are comprised of highly heterogeneous architectures, where different protocols, application stacks, integration services, and orchestration engines co-exist. As they permeate our everyday lives, more of them become safety-critical, increasing the need for making them testable and fault-tolerant, with minimal human intervention. In this paper, we present a set of self-healing extensions for Node-RED, a popular visual programming solution for IoT systems. These extensions add runtime verification mechanisms and self-healing capabilities via new reusable nodes, some of them leveraging meta-programming techniques. With them, we were able to implement self-modification of flows, empowering the system with self-monitoring and self-testing capabilities, that search for malfunctions, and take subsequent actions towards the maintenance of health and recovery. We tested these mechanisms on a set of scenarios using a live physical setup that we called SmartLab.

This was achieved via anti-solvent precipitation coupled with spray-drying. Free-flowing powders of spherical microparticles with wrinkled surface and particle size < 10 m were obtained. The encapsulation efficiency was 75% for vitamin D(3) and 44% for rutin and this could be attributed to their different molecular size and affinity to the aqueous phase. The physicochemical properties were characterized by X-Ray powder diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The two crystalline bioactive compounds were present in the microparticles in amorphous form, which would allow for better bioavailability when compared to non-encapsulated crystalline solid. Therefore, the obtained microparticles would be suitable for use as food ingredient for vitamin D(3) fortification, with the co-encapsulated rutin acting as stability and activity enhancer.","output":"Co-encapsulation of vitamin D and rutin in chitosan-zein microparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Note provides an overview of the debate around the current state of ESG disclosure practices, and the perceived need for the SEC to establish a system of mandatory ESG disclosures.

In this study, we predict changes in haemodynamic parameters (as a part of patient outcome) after valve replacement treatment in aortic stenosis patients. A framework to incorporate uncertainty in patient-specific model predictions for decision support is presented. A 0D lumped parameter model including the left ventricle, a stenotic valve and systemic circulatory system has been developed, based on models published earlier. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to optimize model input parameters to fit measured data pre-intervention. After optimization, the valve treatment is simulated by significantly reducing valve resistance. Uncertain model parameters are then propagated using a polynomial chaos expansion approach. To test the proposed framework, three in silico test cases are developed with clinically feasible measurements. Quality and availability of simulated measured patient data are decreased in each case. The UKF approach is compared to a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach, a well-known approach in modelling predictions with uncertainty. Both methods show increased confidence intervals as measurement quality decreases. By considering three in silico test-cases we were able to show that the proposed framework is able to incorporate optimization uncertainty in model predictions and is faster and the MCMC approach, although it is more sensitive to noise in flow measurements. To conclude, this work shows that the proposed framework is ready to be applied to real patient data.","output":"Uncertainty in model-based treatment decision support: Applied to aortic valve stenosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Similar to patients with chronic hypertension, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) develop fast core progression during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) resulting in large final infarct volumes.

The purpose of the present study was to further evaluate the pathogenesis of combined TCV/EPEC infection in young turkeys and determine the role of these agents in the observed synergistic interaction. Experiments were conducted to determine 1) effect of EPEC dose, with and without concurrent TCV infection, and 2) effect of TCV exposure, before and after EPEC exposure, on development of clinical disease. Additionally, the effect of combined infection on TCV and EPEC shedding was determined. No clinical sign of disease and no attaching and effacing (AE) lesions characteristic of EPEC were observed in turkeys inoculated with only EPEC isolate R98/5, even when turkeys were inoculated with 10(10) colony forming units (CFU) EPEC (high dose exposure). Only mild growth depression was observed in turkeys inoculated with only TCV; however, turkeys inoculated with both TCV and 10(4) CFU EPEC (low dose exposure) developed severe disease characterized by high mortality, marked growth depression, and AE lesions. Inoculation of turkeys with TCV 7 days prior to EPEC inoculation produced more severe disease (numerically greater mortality, significantly lower survival probability [P < 0.05], increased frequency of AE lesions) than that observed in turkeys inoculated with EPEC prior to TCV or simultaneously inoculated with these agents. Coinfection of turkeys with TCV and EPEC resulted in significantly increased (P < 0.05) shedding of EPEC, but not TCV, in intestinal contents of turkeys.

The relationships between sodium balance disorders in COVID-19 patients, its clinical features, implications, and the underlying causes were presented. Hyponatremia patients were observed to be elderly, had more comorbidities, with severe pneumonic chest radiographic findings. They were also more likely to have a fever, nausea, higher leukocyte and neutrophils count, and a high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP). Compared to normonatremia patients, renal insufficiency was common in both hyponatremia and hypernatremia patients. In addition, hyponatremia patients required extensive treatment with oxygen, antibiotics, and corticosteroids. The only significant differences between the hypernatremia and normonatremia patients were laboratory findings and clinical complications, and patients with hypernatremia were more likely to use traditional Chinese medicine for treatment compared to normonatremia patients.

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five isolated wards of a designated hospital in Beijing, China, from July 1 to July 15, 2020. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was conducted to assess psychiatric disorders, and a series of scales were used to measure self-reported psychopathological symptoms and psychosomatic factors. Multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms. RESULTS: Among 119 participants with infections, the prevalence of generalized anxiety symptoms (51.3%), depressive symptoms (41.2%), and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (33.6%) was observed. Loneliness, hope, coping strategies, and history of mental disorders were the shared risk or protective factors across several psychopathological symptoms.

At the time of the NYC Pause (March 22, 2020) when mandatory stay-at-home orders were issued, transit workers had limited worksite protections. Many reported a lack of such basics as face masks (43 percent), hand sanitizer (40 percent), and disposable gloves (34 percent). A high proportion (87 percent) were concerned about getting infected at work. Lack of certain protections was significantly associated with both fear of contagion at work and mental health symptoms. Nearly 24 percent of participants reported a history of COVID-19 infection. Self-reported infection was significantly correlated with lack of certain protections, including respiratory masks (p < 0.001), disposable gloves (p < 0.001), and hand sanitizer (p < 0.001). Infection was also significantly associated with mental health symptoms (p < 0.001). By August 2020, despite participants reporting that many worksite protections were then in place, 72 percent of workers were still fearful for their safety at work, eg, because of potential exposure due to passengers not wearing masks, and risk of verbal abuse and physical assault by passengers angered when asked to wear face masks. Workers who were fearful for their safety at work were more than six times more likely to report mental health symptoms (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Lack of worksite protections before NYC Pause (March 22, 2020) was significantly associated with self-reported infection, fear, and mental health symptoms in TWU, Local 100 members. To reduce the risk of adverse impacts associated with bioevents in all essential work groups, and across all essential occupational settings, infection control preparedness, early recognition of risk, and implementation of tailored risk reduction strategies are imperative. Pandemic preparedness is fundamental to protecting the health and well-being of essential workers and crucial in controlling the spread of disease in the community. Bioevent preparedness for all essential frontline workgroups will also help reduce occupational health inequities. Workers at risk, regardless of setting, deserve and have the right to equal protections under federal and state law. ? 2021 Weston Medical Publishing.

DESIGN: Qualitative systematic review and meta-synthesis. DATA SOURCE: Four electronic databases-PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL). REVIEW METHODS: Qualitative studies with samples of pregnant women, midwives, and/or nurses of maternity units who experienced epidemics and/or pandemics were searched from 1 January 2000 to 4 April 2020. The included studies were critically appraised using the ten-item Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool. FINDINGS: Eight studies were included in this review. Four themes emerged from the synthesis: (1) psychological responses, (2) challenges faced, (3) coping strategies, and (4) sources of support and support needs. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women, midwives, and nurses experienced negative psychological responses during epidemics and pandemics. Challenges, such as limited available information and public stigma, were faced. Various coping strategies, such as actively looking for more information and seeking solace in religions, were practiced by pregnant women, midwives, and nurses. Families were both sources of support and stress and they expressed needs for more informational, emotional, and financial support during pandemics. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: More culturally diverse research in the future that includes the development of technology-based programs, trained community volunteer-led programs, psychosocial interventions, and anti-stigma and awareness initiatives are needed to combat the current pandemic and future public health crises.","output":"Lessons from past epidemics and pandemics and a way forward for pregnant women, midwives and nurses during COVID-19 and beyond: A meta-synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of lung and pleural metastases and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be challenging.

The use of compartment models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated individuals in five different age groups. RESULTS: The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a higher contact rate. CONCLUSION: Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment strategies such as vaccination.","output":"A compartment modelling approach to reconstruct and analyze gender and age-grouped CoViD-19 Italian data for decision-making strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A suite of clustering methods, applied to the matrix of conditional volatility by trading days and individual assets or asset classes, can identify critical periods in markets for crude oil, refined fuels, and other commodities.

This would constitutes a critic space of separation among people in the which aerosols might not be effective to infect healthy people. In addition to wearing masks and face protection, the social distancing appears to be critic to keep people far of infections and consequences produced from it. In this way, the paper has opted by the incorporation of a full deterministic model inside the equation of Weiss, by the which it fits well to the action of outdoor infection when wind manages the direction and displacement of aerosols in space. Thus, while a deterministic approach targets to propose a risks probability, a probabilistic scenario established by Weiss in conjunction to the deterministic events would yield an approximated model of outdoor infection when there is a continuous source of infected aerosols that are moving through air in according to a wind velocity. The simulations have shown that the present approach is valid to some extent in the sense that only the 1D case is considered.

We have developed a sensitive fluorometric assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA without thermal cycling. This assay system, based on tandem isothermal gene amplification (TIGA), is composed of ternary rolling circle amplification (t-RCA) and subsequent strand displacement amplification (SDA) coupled with G-quadruplex-generating RCA (SDA/GQ-RCA). Without the need to convert viral RNA into cDNA, viral RNA forms an ternary complex composed of hairpin primer (HP) and dumbbell padlock DNA during the t-RCA process. t-RCA generates a long chain of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with tandemly repeated hairpin structures that are subjected to SDA. SDA produces multiple short ssDNAs from t-RCA products, which then serve as primers for the second RCA reaction. A long ssDNA harboring repeated copies of the G-quadruplex is produced in the second round of RCA. Emission of enhanced fluorescence by thioflavin T, which intercalates into the G-quadruplex, allows fluorometric detection of amplified viral genes. This fluorometric analysis sensitively detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA as low as 5.9 aM, with a linear range between 0.2 fM and 200 fM within 1 h.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perceived change in physical activity or exercise and mental health outcomes over the short-term in response to COVID-19 mitigation strategies in a sample of adult twins. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 3,971 identical and same-sex fraternal adult twins (909 pairs, 77% identical) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry. Participants in this study completed an online survey examining the impact of COVID-19 mitigation on a number of health-related behaviors and outcomes, administered between March 26 and April 5, 2020. In the present study, the exposure was perceived change in physical activity or exercise. The outcomes were levels of perceived anxiety and stress. RESULTS: More twin pairs reported a decrease in physical activity levels (42%) than those reporting no change (31%) or increased physical activity levels (27%). A perceived decrease in physical activity or exercise was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. However, the physical activityCstress relationship was confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors. On the other hand, the physical activityCanxiety relationship held after controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors, although it was no longer significant after further controlling for age and sex, with older twins more likely to report lower levels of anxiety and females more likely to report higher levels of anxiety.

Yet, it is currently unknown how multiple lifestyle factors interact to influence cognition. The ACTIVate Study aims to (1) explore associations between 24-hour time-use and diet compositions with changes in cognition and brain function; and (2) identify duration of time-use behaviours and the dietary compositions to optimise cognition and brain function. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 3-year prospective longitudinal cohort study will recruit 448 adults aged 60C70 years across Adelaide and Newcastle, Australia. Time-use data will be collected through wrist-worn activity monitors and the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults. Dietary intake will be assessed using the Australian Eating Survey food frequency questionnaire. The primary outcome will be cognitive function, assessed using the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination-III. Secondary outcomes include structural and functional brain measures using MRI, cerebral arterial pulse measured with diffuse optical tomography, neuroplasticity using simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography, and electrophysiological markers of cognitive control using event-related potential and time frequency analyses. Compositional data analysis, testing for interactions between time point and compositions, will assess longitudinal associations between dependent (cognition, brain function) and independent (time-use and diet compositions) variables.

Due to the chronic course of the disease combining with devastating complications, this disorder could easily carry a financial burden. The early diagnosis of diabetes remains as one of the major challenges medical providers are facing, and the satisfactory screening tools or methods are still required, especially a population- or community-based tool. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 15,323 subjects who underwent the annual check-up in the Department of Family Medicine of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2017 to June 2017. With a strict data filtration, 10,436 records from the eligible participants were utilized to develop a prediction model using the J48 decision tree algorithm. Nine variables, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, family history of diabetes, physical activity, work-related stress, and salty food preference, were considered. RESULTS: The accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value for identifying potential diabetes were 94.2%, 94.0%, 94.2%, and 94.8%, respectively. The structure of the decision tree shows that age is the most significant feature. The decision tree demonstrated that among those participants with age  49, 5497 participants (97%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic, while age > 49, 771 participants (50%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic. In the subgroup where people were 34 < age  49 and BMI  25, when with positive family history of diabetes, 89 (92%) out of 97 individuals were identified as diabetic and, when without family history of diabetes, 576 (58%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic. Work-related stress was identified as being associated with diabetes. In individuals with 34 < age  49 and BMI  25 and without family history of diabetes, 22 (51%) of the individuals with high work-related stress were identified as nondiabetic while 349 (88%) of the individuals with low or moderate work-related stress were identified as not having diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a classifier based on a decision tree which used nine features of patients which are easily obtained and noninvasive as predictor variables to identify potential incidents of diabetes. The classifier indicates that a decision tree analysis can be successfully applied to screen diabetes, which will support clinical practitioners for rapid diabetes identification.

Nevertheless, despite the thousands of papers available in the literature showing positive results in preclinical stroke models, randomized clinical trials have failed to show efficacy. It seems clear now that the existing data obtained in preclinical research have depicted an incomplete picture of stroke pathophysiology. In order to ameliorate bench-to-bed translation, in this review we first describe the main actors on stroke inflammatory and immune responses based on the available preclinical data, highlighting the fact that the link between leukocyte infiltration, lesion volume and neurological outcome remains unclear. We then describe what is known on neuroinflammation and immune responses in stroke patients, and summarize the results of the clinical trials on immunomodulatory drugs. In order to understand the gap between clinical trials and preclinical results on stroke, we discuss in detail the experimental results that served as the basis for the summarized clinical trials on immunomodulatory drugs, focusing on (i) experimental stroke models, (ii) the timing and selection of outcome measuring, (iii) alternative entry routes for leukocytes into the ischemic region, and (iv) factors affecting stroke outcome such as gender differences, ageing, comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes, obesity, tobacco, alcohol consumption and previous infections like Covid-19. We can do better for stroke treatment, especially when targeting inflammation following stroke. We need to re-think the design of stroke experimental setups, notably by (i) using clinically relevant models of stroke, (ii) including both radiological and neurological outcomes, (iii) performing long-term follow-up studies, (iv) conducting large-scale preclinical stroke trials, and (v) including stroke comorbidities in preclinical research.","output":"Filling the gaps on stroke research: focus on inflammation and immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that treatment reduces addiction-related harms, including crime and overdose, only a minority of addiction-affected individuals receive it. Linking individuals who committed an addiction-related crime to addiction treatment could improve outcomes. METHODS: The aim of this city-wide, pre-arrest diversion program, Madison Addiction Recovery Initiative (MARI) is to reduce crime and improve health (i.e., reduce the overdose deaths) among adults who committed a minor, non-violent, drug use-related offense by offering them a referral to treatment in lieu of arrest and prosecution of criminal charges. This manuscript outlines the protocol and methods for the MARI program development and implementation. MARI requires its participants to engage in the recommended treatment, without reoffending, during the six-month program, after which the initial criminal charges are voided by the law enforcement agency. The project, implemented in a mid-size U.S. city, has involved numerous partners, including law enforcement, criminal justice, public health, and academia. It includes training of the police officer workforce and collaboration with clinical partners for treatment need assessment, treatment placement, and peer support. Program evaluation includes formative, process, outcome (participant-level) and exploratory impact (community-level) assessments. For outcome evaluation, we will compare crime (primary outcome), overdose-related offenses, and incarceration-related data 12 months before and 12 months after the index crime between participants who completed (Group 1), started but not completed (Group 2), and were offered but did not start (Group 3) the program, and adults who would have been eligible should MARI existed (Historical Comparison, Group 4). Clinical characteristics will be compared at baseline between Groups 1C2, and pre-post the program within Group 1. Participant baseline data will be assessed as potential covariates. Surveys of police officers and program completers, and community-level indicators of crime and overdose pre- versus post-program will provide additional data on the program impact. DISCUSSION: By offering addiction treatment in lieu of arrest and prosecution of criminal charges, this pre-arrest diversion program has the potential to disrupt the cycle of crime, reduce the likelihood of future offenses, and promote public health and safety.","output":"Pre-arrest diversion to addiction treatment by law enforcement: protocol for the community-level policing initiative to reduce addiction-related harm, including crime"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We implemented a real-time report to distribute respiratory pathogen data for our 8-hospital system to anyone with an Internet connection and a web browser.

There are no guidelines on the investigation and management of these effusions. We aimed to review local management to inform future practice Material and Methods: This was a retrospective, observational single centre study, looking at all computed tomography pulmonary angiograms done in a large hospital in the North East of England in 2019. Electronic notes, imaging and discharge letters of patients with PE were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed to describe patient-specific variables, clinical characteristics, pathological findings and subsequent management decisions. Results: 1630 computed tomography pulmonary angiographies (CTPAs) were requested to investigate for PE. Three hundred sixteen (19.4%) were positive for PE. Of those, 89 (28.1%) were identified as having associated pleural effusions. Five (5.8%) patients had a contemporaneous pleural aspiration. All pleural effusions were exudative. Four were consistent with known malignant diagnoses. The other patient had concurrent pneumonia and pancreatitis. Nineteen (21%) had no risk factors for effusion development. The presence of pulmonary infarction/consolidation was associated with the development of a pleural effusion.

Some of the H5N1 and H9N2 virus subtypes induce markedly elevated cytokine levels when compared with the seasonal H1N1 virus. We previously showed that H5N1/97 hyperinduces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha through p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, the detailed mechanisms of p38MAPK activation and TNF-alpha hyperinduction following influenza virus infections are not known. Negative feedback regulations of cytokine expression play important roles in avoiding overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we hypothesize that protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of cytokine expressions during influenza virus infection. We investigated the roles of protein phosphatases including MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) in modulating p38MAPK activation and downstream TNF-alpha expressions in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMac) infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 influenza virus. We demonstrate that H9N2/G1 virus activated p38MAPK and hyperinduced TNF-alpha production in PBMac when compared with H1N1 virus. H9N2/G1 induced PP2A activity in PBMac and, with the treatment of a PP2A inhibitor, p38MAPK phosphorylation and TNF-alpha production were further increased in the virus-infected macrophages. However, H9N2/G1 did not induce the expression of PP2A indicating that the activation of PP2A is not mediated by p38MAPK in virus-infected PBMac. On the other hand, PP2A may not be the targets of H9N2/G1 in the upstream of p38MAPK signaling pathways since H1N1 also induced PP2A activation in primary macrophages. Our results may provide new insights into the control of cytokine dysregulation.","output":"A Role for Protein Phosphatase 2A in Regulating p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Activation and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Expression during Influenza Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The timely identification of breast cancer-related pathogenic variants can help to identify the risk of potential disease development and determine healthcare choices. However, the uptake rate of genetic testing services for breast cancer risk remains low in many countries. Interventions targeting the uptake of these services among individuals potentially at risk for inherited breast cancer are often complex and have multiple components, and are therefore difficult to implement, replicate and disseminate to new contexts. Our aim is to systematically review studies targeting the uptake of genetic testing services for breast cancer risk and critically assess the quality of implementation outcomes and the reporting of intervention descriptions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library and all Campbell Coordinating Group databases will be searched for intervention studies that target individuals' participation in breast cancer genetic testing programmes. Papers published in English within the time period from January 2005 until October 2019 will be considered for inclusion. Titles, abstracts and full papers will be screened for eligibility by two pairs of reviewers independently. For data analysis and synthesis, study-level and intervention-level characteristics will be abstracted. We will present all implementation outcomes that are mentioned in each of the studies and register the number of studies that do not at all look at or report implementation outcomes.

To date, the risk associated with pre-existing hypothyroidism remains unclear. Hypothyroidism affects the innate immune system. Patients with hypothyroidism have higher circulating inflammatory markers, which are associated with increased mortality in COVID-19. A prior study did not find a significant difference in the risk of hospitalization or death in patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism. This study aims to investigate a possible association between pre-existing hypothyroidism and death from COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a tertiary, academic referral center in Richmond, Virginia. We analyzed the unadjusted and adjusted association of patients with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and all-cause hospital mortality. We performed adjusted logistic regressions adjusting for age, gender, race, the month at presentation (an adaptation of the health system), and the remaining 30 individual diagnostic categories of the Elixhauser comorbidity index. RESULTS: Fifty-three (8.2%) of the 649 COVID-19 inpatients had hypothyroidism. Patients with hypothyroidism were, on average, 15.3 years older (95% CI 10.3 to 20.4 years). The unadjusted mortality of patients with hypothyroidism was 22.6% compared with 7.4% in patients without hypothyroidism. The unadjusted mortality OR was 3.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 7.2, P=0.001). The adjusted OR for death was 3.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 9.3, P=0.007, abstract figure). The average adjusted mortality was 18.6% for patients with hypothyroidism compared with 7.8% in patients with equivalent age, gender, race, remaining comorbidities, and month of presentation. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pre-existing hypothyroidism is associated with a three-fold risk of death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. There are conflicting reports in the literature on the association between hypothyroidism and severe COVID-19. Earlier descriptive studies did not report rates of thyroid disease in their cohorts.

We present an investment case for interventions to prevent and manage RHD in the African Union (AU). METHODS: We created a cohort state-transition model to estimate key outcomes in the disease process, including cases of pharyngitis from group A streptococcus, episodes of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), cases of RHD, heart failure, and deaths. With this model, we estimated the impact of scaling up interventions using estimates of effect sizes from published studies. We estimated the cost to scale up coverage of interventions and summarised the benefits by monetising health gains estimated in the model using a full income approach. Costs and benefits were compared using the benefitCcost ratio and the net benefits with discounted costs and benefits. FINDINGS: Operationally achievable levels of scale-up of interventions along the disease spectrum, including primary prevention, secondary prevention, platforms for management of heart failure, and heart valve surgery could avert 74 000 (UI 50 000C104 000) deaths from RHD and ARF from 2021 to 2030 in the AU, reaching a 307% (216C390) reduction in the age-standardised death rate from RHD in 2030, compared with no increase in coverage of interventions. The estimated benefitCcost ratio for plausible scale-up of secondary prevention and secondary and tertiary care interventions was 47 (29C63) with a net benefit of $28 billion (16C39; 2019 US$) through 2030. The estimated benefitCcost ratio for primary prevention scale-up was low to 2030 (02, <01C04), increasing with delayed benefits accrued to 2090. The benefitCcost dynamics of primary prevention were sensitive to the costs of different delivery approaches, uncertain epidemiological parameters regarding group A streptococcal pharyngitis and ARF, assumptions about long-term demographic and economic trends, and discounting. INTERPRETATION: Increased coverage of interventions to control and manage RHD could accelerate progress towards eradication in AU member states. Gaps in local epidemiological data and particular components of the disease process create uncertainty around the level of benefits. In the short term, costs of secondary prevention and secondary and tertiary care for RHD are lower than for primary prevention, and benefits accrue earlier.

OBJECTIVES To assess in patients with a common cold the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms, or in shortening of illness duration. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialized Register and EMBASE up to December 2002; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE up to February 2003. We also followed up references in identified papers. We appealed for further articles at a major international conference on Acute Respiratory Infections (1997). We corresponded with experts and got in touch with pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on treatment of common cold with antihistamines, used either singly or in combination, in adults or children. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted by two reviewers and authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side-effects were extracted and summarized in a systematic review. MAIN RESULTS We included thirty two papers describing 35 comparisons; 22 trials studied monotherapy, 13 trials a combination of antihistamines with other medication. A total of 8930 people suffering from the common cold were included. There were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, and outcomes. There was no evidence of any clinically significant effect - in children or in adults - on general recovery of antihistamines in monotherapy. First generation - but not non-sedating - antihistamines have a small effect on rhinorrhea and sneezing. In trials with first generation antihistamines the incidence of side effects (especially sedation) is significantly higher with active treatment. Two trials, studying a combination of antihistamines with decongestives in small children, both failed to show any effect. Of the eleven trials on older children and adults, the majority show an effect on general recovery and on nasal symptom severity. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS Antihistamines in monotherapy - in children as well as in adults - do not alleviate to a clinical extend nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold. First generation antihistamines also cause more side-effects than placebo, in particular they increase sedation in cold sufferers. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestives are not effective in small children. In older children and adults most trials show a beneficial effect on general recovery as well as on nasal symptoms.

Several first-generation COVID-19 vaccines were approved at the end of 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is persisting worldwide. To be clear, the efficiency and the coverage of current vaccines are insufficient, but newly emerging and rapidly spreading variants are the most pressing concern.

However, no clear explanation for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and a massive increase in the number of infections has yet been proposed. The best solution to overcome this pandemic is the development of suitable and effective vaccines and therapeutics.

We analyzed the impact of this triage plan on the only academic neurosurgery center in San Diego County, California, USA. METHODS: We conducted a de-identified retrospective review of all operative cases and procedures performed by the Department of Neurosurgery from November 24, 2019, through July 6, 2020, a 226-day period. Statistical analysis involved 2-sample z tests assessing daily case totals over the 113-day periods before and after implementation of the OR triage plan on March 16, 2020. RESULTS: The neurosurgical service performed 1429 surgical and interventional radiologic procedures over the study period.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most important health crises of the last century in Spain and worldwide. Mobility reduction interventions have been among the most common public health measures implemented to mitigate the pandemic through reducing community transmission. These measures may have an unequal impact across the population. We present a methodology based on the use of publicly available data from the Instituto Nacional de Estadstica and the Sociedad Espanola de Epidemiologa, to study socioeconomic inequalities in mobility during the pandemic. We describe an application of this methodology for a province (Asturias), showing socioeconomic rural-urban patterns. The use of geographic information system tools can provide useful evidence to explore the social determinants of health at multiple levels.","output":"La experiencia del trabajo con datos de movilidad para detectar desigualdades durante la pandemia de COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We recommend a precautionary approach to respiratory protection for healthcare workers potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 until the efficacy of surgical masks can be proven.","output":"Strengthening respiratory protection from SARS-CoV-2 in certain general practice contexts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The International Dermoscopy Society (IDS) recently released a set of five basic dermoscopic parameters (vessels, scales, follicular findings, \\"other structures,\\" and specific clues) encompassing a total of 31 subitems to standardize the use of dermoscopy in non-neoplastic dermatoses, yet they have been developed taking into account Caucasian/Asian skin, with consequent possible limitations if used in dark skin. OBJECTIVES To validate the abovementioned criteria for the use in dark-skinned patients (phototypes IV-VI) through an expert consensus. METHODS The two-round Delphi method was adopted, with an iterative process consisting of two rounds of email questionnaires. Potential panelists were recruited via e-mail from all over the world based on their expertise on dermoscopy of non-neoplastic dermatoses in skin of color. RESULTS Twenty-two panelists took part in the validation process. All of the five originally proposed parameters and subitems reached agreement during the first round, aside from \\"follicular red dots.\\" Additionally, during round 1, five new subitems were proposed (perifollicular scales distribution, follicular openings obliteration, broken hairs, eccrine pigmentation, and eccrine ostia obliteration), along with the possibility to change the denomination of parameter 3 (from \\"follicular findings\\" to \\"follicular/eccrine findings\\") and split it into two subparameters (\\"follicular findings\\" and \\"eccrine findings\\"). All such proposals reached agreement during the second round and therefore were included in the final list, for a total of 37 items. CONCLUSIONS Although nearly all the dermoscopic criteria originally proposed by the IDS are applicable even to darker phototypes, several additional variables need to be assessed.","output":"International Dermoscopy Society criteria for non-neoplastic dermatoses (general dermatology): validation for skin of color through a Delphi expert consensus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, is a worldwide pandemic Some COVID-19 patients develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and progress to respiratory failure In such cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment is a necessary life-saving procedure CASE SUMMARY: Two special COVID-19 cases-one full-term pregnant woman and one elderly (72-year-old) man-were treated by veno-venous (VV)-ECMO in the Second People's Hospital of Zhongshan, Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province, China Both patients had developed refractory hypoxemia shortly after hospital admission, despite conventional support, and were therefore managed by VV-ECMO Although both experienced multiple ECMO-related complications on top of the COVID-19 disease, their conditions improved gradually Both patients were weaned successfully from the ECMO therapy At the time of writing of this report, the woman has recovered completely and been discharged from hospital to home;the man remains on mechanical ventilation, due to respiratory muscle weakness and suspected lung fibrosis As ECMO itself is associated with various complications, it is very important to understand and treat these complications to achieve optimal outcome CONCLUSION: VV-ECMO can provide sufficient gas exchange for COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome However, it is crucial to understand and treat ECMO-related complications","output":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: Report of two cases and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The burden to fight with Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has lied to frontline health care workers that are putting themselves at a higher risk in the battle against the disease. This study aimed to assess the exposure health risks of COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. METHOD: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on public health workers from May to August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via email and telegram services. Both descriptive statistics and bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify distribution patterns and factors associated with exposure risks to COVID-19. Odds ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a P-value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULT: A total of 418 health care workers participated in the study with a response rate of 99.1%. The majority of the study participants 310(74.2%), were males, and 163(39%) were nurses/ midwives respectively. More than half of the respondents 237(56.7%), had reported that they didn\`t have face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Among the respondents, 173(41.4%), 147(35.2%), 63(15.1%), and 65(15.6%) of the health professionals had always used gloves, medical masks, face shield, or goggles/protective glasses, and disposable gown, respectively. In this study, age between 25-34 years (AOR = 0.20), age between 35-44 years (AOR = 0.13), family size of >6 (AOR = 3.77), work experience of 21-30 years (AOR = 0.01), and good handwashing habit (AOR = 0.44) were the protective factors against COVID-19. On the other hand, perception of non-exposure to COVD 19 (AOR = 9.56), and poor habit of decontamination of high touch areas (AOR = 2.52) were the risk factors associated with confirmed COVID 19 cases among health care workers. CONCLUSION: Poor adherence to personal protective equipment use and aseptic practices during and after health care interactions with patients were identified. Strategies should be implemented to institute effective and sustainable infection control measures that protect the health care workers from COVID-19 infection.","output":"Assessment of exposure risks to COVID-19 among frontline health care workers in Amhara Region, Ethiopia: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy and Spain are two representative examples on strict lockdown last March 2020, also suffering a high rate of mortality in Europe.

Once the pandemic struck, we established a strategy to allow us to continue to serve existing patients and treat the surge of new patients. Starting in March 2020 we were able to transform the system using virtual care platforms through which we conducted almost 83,000 billable televisits in one month and more than 30,000 behavioral health encounters via telephone and video. Telehealth also enabled us to support patient-family communication, post-discharge follow-up, and palliative care for COVID-19 patients. Expanded Medicaid coverage and insurance reimbursement for telehealth played a pivotal role in this transformation.

Pharmacogenetic research has been implemented in recent years thanks to the improvement in genome sequencing techniques and molecular genetics. In addition to medical purposes, pharmacogenetics can constitute an important tool for clarifying the interpretation of toxicological data in post-mortem examinations, sometimes crucial for determining the cause and modality of death. The purpose of this systematic literature review is not only to raise awareness among the forensic community concerning pharmacogenetics, but also to provide a workflow for forensic toxicologists to follow in cases of unknown causes of death related to drug use/abuse. The scientific community is called on to work hard in order to supply evidence in forensic practice, demonstrating that this investigation could become an essential tool both in civil and forensic contexts. The following keywords were used for the search engine: (pharmacogenetics) AND (forensic toxicology); (pharmacogenetics) AND (post-mortem); (pharmacogenetics) AND (forensic science); and (pharmacogenetics) AND (autopsy). A total of 125 articles were collected. Of these, 29 articles were included in this systematic review. A total of 75% of the included studies were original articles (n = 21) and 25% were case reports (n = 7). A total of 78% (n = 22) of the studies involved deceased people for whom a complete autopsy was performed, while 22% (n = 6) involved people in good health who were given a drug with a subsequent pharmacogenetic study. The most studied drugs were opioids (codeine, morphine, and methadone), followed by antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine). Furthermore, all studies highlighted the importance of a pharmacogenetics study in drug-related deaths, especially in cases of non-overdose of drugs of abuse.

Globally, there are an estimated 685 million infections annually due to norovirus, among them 200 million children under the age of 5, causing approximately 50,000 child deaths per year and costing an estimated $60 billion annually in healthcare. In the USA, HuNoV is responsible for 19-21 million illnesses, with an average of 570-800 deaths per year. HuNoV is especially pernicious because it requires less than 100 viral particles to cause an infection, and there are few effective disinfectants. It is believed that Ultraviolet Subtype C (UVC) irradiation might prove to be an effective disinfectant. This study seeks to determine the inactivation profile of UVC against norovirus using a Klaran UVC Light-emitting diode (LED) array product number KL265-50V-SM-WD, emitting radiation at 269 nm peak wavelength and a measured fluence of 1.25 mW/cm2 at a 7 cm source-surface distance. Since the HuNoV cannot currently be propagated in cell cultures, the study utilized feline calicivirus (FCV), a recommended surrogate as challenge organism. The test followed Modified ASTM E2197. Assessment of virus inactivation was performed using plaque assay method, with Crystal Violet as a staining agent to enhance plaque visualization. Within 18 seconds of exposure time at a UVC irradiance of 1.25mW/cm2 and a dose of 22.5 mJ/cm2, the study obtained 99.9 % virus reduction (3 log reduction value).

Several immunogenic regions, mainly located within the S1 subunit, have been identified. Nonetheless, these immune-dominant regions were defined using selected monoclonal antibodies or using a short peptide approach that involves only certain limited regions of the S protein. In addition, some immune-dominant regions are located in hypervariable regions (HVRs) which are not present in all serotypes. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine a broader range of antigenic regions that have strong antibody eliciting ability; these could then be applied for development of an IBV-diagnostic tool. Initially, the S1 and part of the S2 subunit protein (24-567 amino acids) were expressed as five fragments in prokaryotic system. The antigenicity was confirmed using IBV immunized sera. Performance of the S subfragments was evaluated by ELISA using a panel of field chicken sera with known IBV titres determined by a commercial kit. This indicated that, among the five antigenic recombinant proteins, the region S-E showed the highest specificity and sensitivity, namely 95.38 % and 96.29 %, respectively. The  value for the in-house ELISA using the S-E fragment compared to a commercial kit was 0.9172, indicating a high agreement between these two methods.

Recently dental AGP have attracted significant attention as a possible vector for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and attempts have been made to establish when a surgery may be safely decontaminated following a dental AGP  the fallow time. There is a paucity of research in the dental literature regarding the near real time generation and dispersion of dental aerosol following a dental AGP. Study aims are to: (1) monitor dental aerosol generation and dispersal through semi-continuous particle count values (PCV), and (2) use this information to delineate a range of suitable fallow times. Method: Following baseline measurements, five identical dental AGP were conducted on a dental manikin for each of three groups: (SEO) saliva ejector only, (HVA) high volume aspiration, (WO) high volume aspiration with windows open. For each procedure PCV were recorded every 2.2 minutes with a Light Scattering Airborne Particle Counter (LSAPC) for 3.3 hours. Eleven dependent variables were analysed, including baseline PCV, total PCV, peak PCV, time taken to return to one sample standard deviation of baseline PCV, and a time series extending from 15 minutes to 3 hours after cessation of AGP. Due to heterogeneity, the data was analysed with Krushkall-Wallis test and Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc . Results: Between group mean baseline PCV were not statistically significant. Compared with SEO, WO had a statistically significant impact on peak PCV ( p =.009) and HVA had a statistically significant impact on total PCV ( p =.006). With the exception at 2 and 3 hours, PCV throughout the time series were statistically significantly lower for WO and HVA in comparison with SEO. WO PCV were influenced by outdoor aerosol levels.Four of the five SEO procedures failed to return to baseline PCV within 3.3 hours. Following AGP, the mean time for the HVA procedures to return to baseline PCV was 17.12 minutes, 95% CI [4.96 to 29.28]. The effect of HVA on the time taken to return to baseline PCV was very large (Glasss = -4.943, CLES=1.00). Conclusion: There is a significant benefit in opening windows during AGP. The effect of HVA on reducing fallow time is very large. Under the conditions of this study, PCV suggest that it might be safe to consider a fallow time of 29.28 minutes.","output":"Quantitative evaluation of dental bio-aerosols using particle count values.

Polymorphisms in the S protein can affect cleavage, viral transmission, and pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of arising S polymorphisms in vitro and in vivo to understand the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. First, we showed that the S:655Y is selected after in vivo replication in the mink model. This mutation is present in the Gamma Variant Of Concern (VOC) but it also occurred sporadically in early SARS-CoV-2 human isolates. To better understand the impact of this polymorphism, we analyzed the in vitro properties of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 isolates containing S:655Y in different lineage backgrounds. Results demonstrated that this mutation enhances viral replication and spike protein cleavage. Viral competition experiments using hamsters infected with WA1 and WA1-655Y isolates showed that the variant with 655Y became dominant in both direct infected and direct contact animals. Finally, we investigated the cleavage efficiency and fusogenic properties of the spike protein of selected VOCs containing different mutations in their spike proteins. Results showed that all VOCs have evolved to acquire an increased spike cleavage and fusogenic capacity despite having different sets of mutations in the S protein. Our study demonstrates that the S:655Y is an important adaptative mutation that increases viral cell entry, transmission, and host susceptibility. Moreover, SARS-COV-2 VOCs showed a convergent evolution that promotes the S protein processing.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have acquired mutations associated with an increased spike cleavage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to have a long-lasting impact on the approach to care for patients at risk for and with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the risks from potential exposure and resource reallocation.

This concept is important because it can give healthcare providers a tool to identify issues that may need to be addressed with their patients, but few studies have investigated illness perception in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs). CTCL is a chronic and often debilitating group of malignancies that can have an indolent but remitting course. Treatment options may also be burdensome to the patient;therefore, it is important to gain an understanding of CTCL patients' beliefs about their disease and how those beliefs impact their quality of life (QOL). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to investigate how significant disruptions in access to healthcare have impacted illness perception and QOL. The objectives of this study are to identify disease understanding in patients with CTCL, investigate the impact additional education modalities have on disease understanding, and whether disparities exist between specific groups of patients. This study also aims to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted healthcare-related QOL in this population. CTCL patients of the Johns Hopkins Hospital above the age of 18 are recruited for this study. Patients are given an electronic survey containing the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R), Skindex-29, FACT-G7, and selected questions based on the Household Pulse survey to assess COVID impact on QOL. Patients are then randomly selected to view an educational PowerPoint with educational material on CTCL, in addition to verbal education routinely given during their visit. Follow-up responses to these questions will be collected at 2 and 6 months after the initial survey. In this ongoing study, we anticipate a total sample size of 100 patients. Thus far, initial survey responses have been collected from 39 patients, 60% who identified as male and 40% who identified as female. 44% of patients identified as \\"White,\\" 36% identified as \\"Black/African American,\\" 10% as \\"Hispanic/Latino,\\" 8% as \\"Asian,\\" and 2% as \\"Other.\\" 34% of patients were Stage 1B at time of survey. Most patients (22.99 + 4.2) perceived their diseases to be chronic but endorsed a high sense of personal control (21.61 + 4.2) and therapeutic control (18.98 + 2.6) over their conditions. Patients between 40-59 demonstrated higher disease consequence, as did patients within the Black/African American patient group. Illness coherence was also significantly higher for White patients when compared to Black/African American patients. Therefore, it appears that patients 40-59 may be more emotionally and practically affected by their disease, potentially because these patients are at the highest level of work and life productivity. Further, these results indicate that a gap may exist within the Black/African American community that may negatively affect these patients' QOL. The outcomes from additional initial and follow-up surveys from this ongoing study will provide insight into the use of additional educational modalities to improve patient understanding of CTCL, with the goal of addressing common patient misconceptions about the disease, improving educational resources, and identifying actionable paths to diminish the inequities identified by this study.

METHODS AND RESULTS The ACCOAST study randomised 4033 patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) to (A) a 30 mg prasugrel loading dose (LD) followed by coronary angiography with an additional 30 mg prasugrel at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or (B) a placebo LD followed by a 60 mg prasugrel at the time of PCI. Patients received standard of care, including use of aspirin. Independent predictors of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) within 7 days were assessed using stepwise Cox proportional model for time to first occurrence of the event. Non-CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding was similarly analysed. Non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding occurred in 36 (0.9%) patients, and TIMI major or minor bleeding occurred in 81 (2.0%) patients. Independent predictors for TIMI major bleeding alone were pretreatment with prasugrel LD (HR 3.02; 95% CI 1.42 to 6.43), femoral access (HR 2.45; 95% CI 1.11 to 5.38), female sex (HR 2.57; 95% CI 1.32 to 5.00), placement of >1 stent (HR 2.50; 95% CI 1.26 to 4.95) and age (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09). Pretreatment with prasugrel LD (HR 3.05; 95% CI 1.84 to 5.07), femoral access (HR 3.06; 95% CI 1.74 to 5.38), female sex (HR 2.62; 95% CI 1.67 to 4.12), performed PCI (HR 2.21; 95% CI 1.23 to 3.99), therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.06 to 3.33) and age (increased bleed per year of age HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) were independent predictors of TIMI major or minor bleeding through 7 days.

Since the therapeutic approaches and prognoses differ significantly between the diseases, the correct diagnosis is of fundamental importance. In routine clinical practice, next to the patients history, the clinical presentation, the laboratory findings and the bronchoscopy, imaging plays a central role in establishing a diagnosis. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: The diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases is an enormous challenge for clinicians, radiologists as well as pathologists and should therefore preferably be carried out in a multidisciplinary setting. Since patients often present with unspecific, respiratory symptoms, chest radiographs are the first imaging method used. Many patterns of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (e.g., ground-glass opacities and consolidations), their distribution (e.g., cranial-caudal) and the presence of additional findings (e.g., mediastinal lymphadenopathy) are often already detectable on chest X?rays. However, the imaging reference standard and thus, an integral part of the assessment of diffuse parenchymal lung disease, is the chest HR-CT. In some cases, the pattern of the HR-CT is pathognomonic, in others it is unspecific for a disease, so that further diagnostic steps are necessary.","output":"R?ntgenbefunde bei diffusen parenchymat?sen Lungenerkrankungen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic downturn and the air travel crisis triggered by the recent coronavirus pandemic pose a substantial threat to the new consumer class of many emerging economies. In Brazil, considerable improvements in social inclusion have fostered the emergence of hundreds of thousands of first-time fliers over the past decades. We apply a two-step regression methodology in which the first step consists of identifying air transport markets characterized by greater social inclusion, using indicators of the local economies income distribution, credit availability, and access to the Internet. In the second step, we inspect the drivers of the plunge in air travel demand since the pandemic began, differentiating markets by their predicted social inclusion intensity. After controlling for potential endogeneity stemming from the spread of COVID-19 through air travel, our results suggest that short and low-density routes are among the most impacted airline markets and that business-oriented routes are more impacted than leisure ones. Finally, we estimate that a market with 1% higher social inclusion is associated with a 0.153%C0.166% more pronounced decline in demand during the pandemic. Therefore, markets that have benefited from greater social inclusion in the country may be the most vulnerable to the current crisis.","output":"Testing the differentiated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel demand considering social inclusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the potential of olanexidine gluconate as environmental disinfectant against enveloped viruses in the suspension test and three non-porous surface tests.

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the dental health of people with disabilities in order to understand if their needs are met and to identify their most critical issues as per dentists. A paper and a Google Form platform were used in conducting a survey in Central Italy (the Abruzzo region), by performing an analysis on different points of view as reported by people with disabilities and dentists. The results showed that only 69.2% of dentists treat persons with disabilities. Of these, 73.5% treat less than 10 patients with physical disabilities per year. However, 54% of dentists do not treat people with cognitive impairment and a poor ability to collaborate during treatment. More than 80% of respondent dentists report that people with disabilities do not have good oral hygiene. On the other hand, 49.1% of people with disabilities (or their caregivers in cases where the patient was unable to answer) report that they rarely or never go to the dental office. Moreover, when they do go, it is mainly for emergencies. Despite this, respondents are well aware of their dental problems. However, they have difficulties in communicating their dental problems to their dentist. The 50% of dentists who treat people with cognitive impairment do not include them in follow-up, while only 20% of these patients reported being regularly recalled. This illustrates the importance of the implementation of follow-up. In addition, training courses could help clinicians to reduce this gap and create barrier-free dental offices.","output":"Access to Dental CareA Survey from Dentists, People with Disabilities and Caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits (PGNMID) is a rare form of PGN that mimics immune-complex (IC) GN by light microscopy (LM), but shows monoclonal IgG deposits by immunofluorescence (IF). PGNMID often presents with membranoproliferative (MPGN) pattern or endocapillary hypercellularity. Focal crescents are not uncommon in PGNMID, but diffuse crescentic involvement is very rare. Methods: 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension and multiple cardiovascular comorbidities presented with weakness, dizziness, and anorexia, and was found to have severe hypertension and acute kidney injury with serum creatinine of 12 mg/dl (baseline 1 mg/dl). He was a chronic smoker and alcoholic. He reported productive cough with scanty whitish sputum, but denied hemoptysis. Urine analysis showed marked proteinuria, hematuria, and leukocyturia. Renal ultrasound revealed bilateral decrease corticomedullary differentiation without obstruction. Hemodialysis was initiated. Imaging showed bilateral upper lobe pneumonia with concerns for alveolar hemorrhages. Serology for complements, ANA, dsDNA, ANCA, Hepatitis B and C, Covid19 was negative. Kappa/lambda free light chain ratio was normal. SPEP, UPEP and immunofixation were negative for paraproteinemia. Renal biopsy showed diffuse crescentic and endocapillary PGN with MPGN features, and linear monoclonal IgG3-kappa immune deposits. Given the lack of clinical evidence of cryoglobulinemia and presence of immune-type electron dense deposits without organized substructures by EM, the findings were most consistent with PGNMID. However, the unusual biopsy presentation raised concerns for possible concurrent anti-GBM disease. Subsequently, Solu-Medrol was started followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg. He received 2 sessions of plasmapheresis before anti-GBM serology returned negative. Bone marrow biopsy revealed monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis with CLL phenotype. Unfortunately, the patient developed Covid19 infection, and passed away before receiving further treatment. [Formula presented] Results: PGNMID is a rare form of renal involvement by monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition that mimics ICGN on renal biopsy. Nephrotic range proteinuria, hematuria and renal insufficiency are usual presentation. Cases of PGNMID classically show IgG3k, in a granular glomerular capillary wall, mesangial, and occasionally subepithelial distribution. By EM, these deposits appear granular typical of ICGN which lack organized substructure. The predominant LM patterns are MPGN and endocapillary hypercellularity. Less frequently focal crescents may be present, but diffuse crescentic involvement is especially rare (~5%). In our case, the diffuse cellular crescents and semilinear to linear GBM staining was unusual. Together with the clinical presentation, the findings prompted concerns for a concomitant Goodpasture syndrome, but anti-GBM antibody returned negative. The pathogenesis is still unclear, but some authors suggest infection as a possible trigger for crescentic transformation in PGNMID. The presence of crescents seem to confer a poorer prognosis and associated with progression to ESRD. Conclusions: Our case is a unique presentation of PGNMID in a patient who presented with clinical and pathologic features concerning for Goodpasture syndrome. PGNMID can rarely present with diffuse crescents and IF findings similar to anti-GBM nephritis in a patient with RPGN.

An integral part of the severe malaria pathogenesis is rosetting, the adherence of parasite infected red blood cells (RBCs) to uninfected RBCs. Rosetting is influenced by the hosts ABO blood group (Bg) and rosettes formed in BgA have previously been shown to be more resilient to disruption by heparin and shield the parasite derived surface antigens from antibodies. However, data on rosetting in weak BgA subgroups is scarce and based on investigations of relatively few donors. METHODS: An improved high-throughput flow cytometric assay was employed to investigate rosetting characteristics in an extensive panel of RBC donor samples of all four major ABO Bgs, as well as low BgA expressing samples. RESULTS: All non-O Bgs shield the parasite surface antigens from strain-specific antibodies towards P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). A positive correlation between A-antigen levels on RBCs and rosette tightness was observed, protecting the rosettes from heparin- and antibody-mediated disruption. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new insights into how the ABO Bg system affects the disease outcome and cautions against interpreting the results from the heterogeneous BgA phenotype as a single group in epidemiological and experimental studies.

Patients, clinicians and hospital authorities have had to balance the risks to patients of attending hospital, many of whom are especially vulnerable, with the risks of delaying or modifying cancer treatment. Those whose care has been significantly impacted include patients suffering from the effects of cancer on bone, where delivering the usual standard of care for bone support has often not been possible and clinicians have been forced to seek alternative options for adequate management. At a virtual meeting of the Cancer and Bone Society in July 2020, an expert group shared experiences and solutions to this challenge, following which a questionnaire was sent internationally to the symposium's participants, to explore the issues faced and solutions offered. 70 respondents, from 9 countries (majority USA, 39%, followed by UK, 19%) included 50 clinicians, spread across a diverse range of specialties (but with a high proportion, 64%, of medical oncologists) and 20 who classified themselves as non-clinical (solely lab-based). Spread of clinician specialty across tumour types was breast (65%), prostate (27%), followed by renal, myeloma and melanoma. Analysis showed that management of metastatic bone disease in all solid tumour types and myeloma, adjuvant bisphosphonate breast cancer therapy and cancer treatment induced bone loss, was substantially impacted. Respondents reported delays to routine CT scans (58%), standard bone scans (48%) and MRI scans (46%), though emergency scans were less affected. Delays in palliative radiotherapy for bone pain were reported by 31% of respondents with treatments often involving only a single dose without fractionation. Delays to, or cancellation of, prophylactic surgery for bone pain were reported by 35% of respondents. Access to treatments with intravenous bisphosphonates and subcutaneous denosumab was a major problem, mitigated by provision of drug administration at home or in a local clinic, reduced frequency of administration or switching to oral bisphosphonates taken at home. The questionnaire also revealed damaging delays or complete stopping of both clinical and laboratory research.

Past studies in reinforcement learning and educational psychology have linked prediction error, a measure of surprise, to successful learning from feedback. However, there are substantial individual differences in belief-updating success, and the psychological factors that influence belief updating remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel factor that may predict belief updating: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), which is characterized by a desire for order, structure, and preservation of social norms. We hypothesized that because people who score high on RWA are motivated to preserve entrenched beliefs, they may often fail to successfully update their beliefs when confronted with new information. Using a novel paradigm, we challenged participants false beliefs and misconceptions to elicit prediction error. In two studies, we found consistent evidence that high-RWA individuals were less successful at correcting their false beliefs. Relative to low-RWA individuals, high-RWA individuals were less likely to revise beliefs in response to prediction error. We argue that RWA is associated with a relatively closed-minded cognitive style that negatively influences belief updating.

Although researchers have studied the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking, the underlying factors of both associations are rarely compared. Using path analysis, we compared the mediating effects of behaviour-specific outcome expectancies and self-efficacy beliefs on the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking.

Alexithymia exhibited indirect effects on risky drinking via expectations of increased confidence and negative consequences. However, the indirect effects differed depending on the valance of the emotion the individual had difficulties appraising. Our findings indicate that the underlying factors in the associations between alexithymia and both NSSI and risky drinking could differ.

We conducted a comprehensive global study investigating the number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published on different health conditions, and how this compares with the global disease burden that they impose. Methods We use machine learning to monitor PubMed daily, and find and analyse RCT reports. We assessed RCTs investigating the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from the Global Burden of Disease study. Using regression models, we compared numbers of actual RCTs in different health conditions to numbers predicted from their global disease burden (Disability-Adjusted Life Years [DALYs]). We investigated whether RCT numbers differed for conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socio-economic development. Results We estimate 463,000 articles describing RCTs (95% prediction interval 439,000-485,000) were published from 1990 to July 2020. RCTs recruited a median of 72 participants (interquartile range 32-195). 82% of RCTs were conducted by researchers in the top fifth of countries by socio-economic development. As DALYs increased for a particular health condition by 10%, the number of RCTs in the same year increased by 5% (3.2%-6.9%), but the association was weak (adjusted R2=0.13). Conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socio-economic development, including respiratory infections and tuberculosis (7 thousand RCTs below predicted) and enteric infections (10 thousand RCTs below predicted), appear relatively under-researched for their disease burden. Each 10% shift in DALYs towards countries with low and middle socio-economic development was associated with a 4% reduction in RCTs (3.7%-4.9%). These disparities have not changed substantially over time. Conclusion Research priorities are not well optimized to reduce the global burden of disease.

Many trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Hence, clinicians may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. We study treatment choice from the perspective of statistical decision theory, which considers treatment options symmetrically when assessing trial findings. METHODS: We use the concept of near-optimality to evaluate criteria for treatment choice. This concept jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. RESULTS: Considering the design of some COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment choices that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests. CONCLUSION: Using trial findings to make near-optimal treatment choices rather than perform hypothesis tests should improve clinical decision making.","output":"Statistical Decision Properties of Imprecise Trials Assessing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) will likely become available within the next year, but their impact on global health will depend on public acceptance and uptake Winning that trust won't be easy if recent protests over face coverings are any indication However, health experts are drawing important lessons from the anti-mask movement, too According to Alison Thompson, a bioethics professor at the University of Toronto, the opposition to masks speaks to an underlying mistrust of public health messaging and the science around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) \\"If we take [the backlash] as baseline data around how much mistrust is out there, we have reason to be concerned about how a vaccine will be taken up by the public,\\" Thompson says","output":"Public health experts are learning from Canada's anti-mask protests: CMAJ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food hygiene is indisputably one of the most important issues in terms of public health and safety Food workers are the leading staff members for the compliance of the basic hygiene rules COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more attention especially for the exported goods from the higher case countries Even though there is no evidence about the food contamination and COVID-19 risk, according to the European Food Safety Authority, food hygiene practices are important to avoid any contamination risks Managers are known to have a significant influence on the behavior of their subordinates In the relevant literature, it is stated that interactional justice, which is called the behavior of managers concerning their subordinates and providing adequate information and explanation about the decisions taken, is the most important indicator of the performance and efficiency of subordinates From this point on, it is thought that interactional justice will affect the behavior of food workers to comply with the hygiene rules In this research, employees' perceptions of interactional justice are planned to be measured using the informational and interpersonal justice subscales of the organizational justice scale The tendencies to comply with the hygiene rules will be measured by asking the requirements of the HACCP food security system At the end of this study, we expect to reach the processing operation involved workers of the investigated food companies ?

Retrospective seroprevalence surveys are often used to screen for unidentified previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the rate of humoral response in HCWs affected by COVID-19 is not well-defined. AIMS: To assess the specific IgG humoral response in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs and identify potential factors associated with humoral response. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 204 HCWs with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 humoral response. Serum-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analysed using two commercially available serological assays. A logistic regression was performed to identify independent factors associated with positive IgG serology test. RESULTS: Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate was 77%. This seropositivity rate was higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic COVID-19 infection (83% versus 57%; P < 0.001) and in older HCWs.. The seropositivity rate did not diminish with time. In logistic regression, only a history of COVID-19 symptoms and age were identified as independent factors associated with the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are found significantly more frequently in symptomatic and in older HCWs.

Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period.

We aimed to study the course of pertussis in France over an 8-year period and its association with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, using multiple nationwide data sources. MethodsWe analyzed the number of French pertussis cases between 2013 and 2020, using the PCR test results from nationwide outpatient laboratories (Source 1) and the pediatric network of 41 hospitals (Source 2), and using the reports of an office-based pediatric national network (Source 3). We conducted a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis, relying on negative binomial regression models. The models accounted for seasonality, long-term cycles, and secular trend, and included a binary variable for the first national lockdown (ordered on March 16, 2021). ResultsWe identified 19,039 cases of pertussis from the three data sources during the study period. There was a significant decrease of pertussis cases following the implementation of mitigation measures, with adjusted incidence rate ratios of 0.102 (95% CI 0.040-0.256) and 0.216 (95% CI 0.071-0.656) for Source 1 and Source 2, respectively.

Here, we show that human Usb1 removes 3 adenosines with 20-fold greater efficiency than uridines, which explains the presence of adenylated U6 snRNAs in cells lacking Usb1. We determined three high-resolution co-crystal structures of Usb1: wild-type Usb1 bound to the substrate analog adenosine 5-monophosphate, and an inactive mutant bound to RNAs with a 3 terminal adenosine and uridine. These structures, along with QM/MM MD simulations of the catalytic mechanism, illuminate the molecular basis for preferential deadenylation of U6 snRNA.

METHODS A convenience sample of 16 AA women completed an informatics survey prior to participating in focus groups exploring their use of mobile technology and health apps. Survey responses provided frequency data, while iterative transcript analysis of focus groups identified themes. RESULTS The majority of participants (mean age=62.1 years, SD=6.6) felt comfortable using a tablet/smartphone (75.0%). Most (68.8%) reported using health-related apps, primarily focused on physical activity and nutrition. Focus groups revealed four overarching concepts, including (1) user attachment, (2) technology adoption, (3) potential facilitators and (4) potential barriers. Important features which may serve as facilitators or barriers to future adoption of a mobile app for an mHealth intervention include individual app tailoring and software concerns, respectively.

Although the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic disease to the development of severe acute respiratory distress, children are generally milder than adults. It was aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory values of symptomatic and asymptomatic children followed up with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in this study. Materials and Methods: The records of children with nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction test positive were analyzed retrospectively. Children with symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and/or vomiting were accepted as symptomatic, and children with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in a nasopharyngeal swab taken only due to contact history and have no symptoms were considered asymptomatic. Results: A total of 197 patients, 47 (23.8%) symptomatic and 150 (76.2%) asymptomatic, were included in the study. The mean age of the children was 9.15.2 years (range, 1 month-17 years). Cough (8.6%) was the most common symptom at admission. When the symptomatic and asymptomatic children were compared in terms of white blood cell (WBC), WBC subgroups, C-reactive protein there was no statistically significant difference. No significant increase was found in the CRP values of symptomatic patients. Ground-glass opacities compatible with COVID-19 was detected in only 10 (30%) of 33 symptomatic patients who underwent thoracic tomography. Conclusion: COVID-19 is usually mild in children. At the same time, a significant change in laboratory parameters and imaging findings may not be observed in symptomatic and/or asymptomatic children with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. ? 2021, Galenos Publishing House.

We used multivariable regression with a generalised estimating equation accounting for country as a random effect to analyse the association of different medication classes with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use and/or death. RESULTS: 1439 cases from 47 countries were included (mean age 44.1 years, 51.4% men) of whom 112 patients (7.8%) had severe COVID-19. Compared with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist monotherapy, thiopurine monotherapy (adjusted OR (aOR) 4.08, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.61) and combination therapy with TNF antagonist and thiopurine (aOR 4.01, 95% CI 1.65 to 9.78) were associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. Any mesalamine/sulfasalazine compared with no mesalamine/sulfasalazine use was associated with an increased risk (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29). This risk estimate increased when using TNF antagonist monotherapy as a reference group (aOR 3.52, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.45).

Rather than being a theory of risk, risk society theory is more a social theory of the new social world and modernity.

Beck also proposes the cosmopolitan outlook and particularly methodological cosmopolitanism as the epistemology and methodology of the world risk society. Yet, a close examination of Beck's social theory reveals a contradiction between the two aspects. On the one hand, in the ontological dimension, we are faced with the primacy of the indeterminate and the empirical, but on the other hand, Beck's epistemological prescriptive eliminate the possibility of reaching them. The current article aims to address this incompatibility. In doing so, first, the main pillars of risk society theory, and then the cosmopolitan outlook and sociology are discussed. By criticizing Beck's epistemological apparatus as well as juxtaposing the theory of risk society and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of action and fields, in the final section, the article proposes a solution to complete the ontology of risk society and overcome some of its epistemological problems.","output":"World Risk Society and Constructing Cosmopolitan Realities: A Bourdieusian Critique of Risk Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le stress est un mcanisme dadaptation, une raction saine mais plus ou moins intense  des situations de notre existence.

Consequently, virtual health solutions have been increasingly adopted, and health systems in the United States have been reorganizing their care delivery process with unprecedented speed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess and make recommendations on the strategy, business model, implementation, and future considerations for scaling and sustaining virtual health solutions based on the views of executives from the largest health systems in the United States. METHODS: In September 2020 and October 2020, the Health Management Academy conducted 29 quantitative surveys and 23 qualitative interviews involving 58 executives from 41 of the largest health systems in the United States. Participating health systems were approximately equally distributed across size categories (small, medium, and large, defined as annual total operating revenue US $2-3 billion, $3-6 billion, and >$6 billion, respectively) and US Census Bureau regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). RESULTS: Based on the Health Management Academys assessment of approaches to governance, financing, data infrastructure, and clinical integration of virtual health, most participating health systems (13/24, 54%) had a mid-stage level of maturity in virtual health implementation. Executives reported the pandemic is forcing health systems to re-examine strategic priorities; the most commonly raised key impacts were increased access (15/21, 71%) and flexibility (10/21, 48%) as well as lower costs of care delivery (9/21, 43%). Most executives (16/28, 57%) reported their organization had a defined budget for virtual health, and many noted that virtual health is best supported through value-based payment models. Irrespective of health system maturity, reimbursement was consistently rated as a key challenge to virtual health scaling, along with patient access to and understanding of virtual health technology. The success of virtual health implementation was most commonly measured by patient satisfaction, health care provider engagement, and proportion of health care providers using virtual health solutions (reported by 7/8, 88%; 6/8, 75%; and 7/8, 75% of information technology executives, respectively). Almost all health systems (27/29, 93%) expect to continue growing their virtual health offerings for the foreseeable future, with user-friendliness and ease of integration into the electronic medical record as key factors in making go-forward decisions on virtual health solutions (each selected by 9/10, 90% executives). CONCLUSIONS: The increased demand for virtual health solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue postpandemic. Consequently, health systems are re-evaluating their current platforms, processes, and strategy to develop a sustainable, long-term approach to virtual health. To ensure future success, health system leaders need to proactively build on their virtual health solutions; advocate for payment, site flexibility, and reimbursement parity for virtual health; and demonstrate continued engagement and boldness to evolve care beyond established models.","output":"Accelerating Virtual Health Implementation Following the COVID-19 Pandemic: Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: This commentary provides a timely evidence-based overview on the impact of COVID-19 on dental care and oral health and identifies gaps in protection of patients and staff in dental settings.

Infections caused by Clostridium difficile and fungal organisms were excluded. Studies focusing exclusively on resistant organism infections were also excluded. Results Eighteen of 22588 retrieved studies met the inclusion criteria. From these, 16 studies reported a statistically significant association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent risk of community-acquired infection. Infections associated with prior antibiotic use included Campylobacter jejuni infection (one study), recurrent furunculosis (one study), invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b infection (one study), infectious mastitis (one study), meningitis (one study), invasive pneumococcal disease (one study), Staphylococcus aureus skin infection (one study), typhoid fever (two studies), recurrent boils and abscesses (one study), upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection (one study) and Salmonella infection (five studies), although in three studies on Salmonella infection the effect was of marginal statistical significance. Conclusions We found an association between prior antibiotic use and subsequent risk of a diverse range of community-acquired infections.

METHODS We performed a retrospective search of our six obstetrical and gynecologic departmental ultrasound databases for all CSPs and recurrent CSPs between 2010 and 2019. We extracted various data, including numbers of CSPs with follow-up, numbers attempting and numbers achieving pregnancy following treatment of the CSP and numbers of recurrent CSPs, as well as details of the treatment of the original CSP. After analyzing the clinical data, we evaluated whether the mode of treatment terminating the previous CSP was associated with the risk of recurrent CSP. We also performed a PubMed search for: 'recurrent Cesarean scar pregnancy' and 'recurrent Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy'. Articles were reviewed for year of publication and extraction and analysis of the same data as those obtained from our departmental databases. RESULTS Our database search identified 252 cases of CSP. The overall rate of clinical follow-up ranged between 71.4% and 100%, according to treatment site (mean, 90.9%). Among these, 105 were followed by another pregnancy after treatment of the previous CSP. Of these, 36 (34.3%) pregnancies were recurrent CSP, with 27 women having a single recurrence and three women having multiple recurrences, one with two, one with three and one with four. We did not find any particular single or combination treatment mode terminating the previous CSP to be associated with recurrent CSP. The literature search identified 17 articles that yielded sufficient information for us to evaluate their reported prevalence of recurrent CSP. They reported 1743 primary diagnoses of CSP, and 944 had reliable follow-up. There were data for 489 cases in which a woman attempted to conceive again, and on 327 pregnancies achieved, after treatment of a previous CSP. Of these, 67 (20.5%) were recurrent CSP. CONCLUSION On the basis of our pooled clinical data and review of the literature, recurrent CSP is apparently more common than was previously assumed based upon mostly single case reports or series with few cases. This should be borne in mind when counseling patients undergoing treatment for CSP regarding their risk of recurrence. We found no obvious causal relationship or association between the type of treatment for the previous CSP and recurrence of CSP. Patients pregnant after treatment for a CSP should be encouraged to have an early (5-7-week) first-trimester transvaginal scan to determine the location of the gestation.

The complex origin, extended human-to-human transmission, pathogenesis, host immune responses, and various clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 have presented serious challenges in understanding and combating the pandemic situation. Human CoVs gained attention only after the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002-2003. On the other hand, animal CoVs have been studied extensively for many decades, providing a plethora of important information on their genetic diversity, transmission, tissue tropism and pathology, host immunity, and therapeutic and prophylactic strategies, some of which have striking resemblance to those seen with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the evolution of human CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, is intermingled with those of animal CoVs. In this comprehensive review, attempts have been made to compare the current knowledge on evolution, transmission, pathogenesis, immunopathology, therapeutics, and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 with those of various animal CoVs.

AIMS: Given the significant influenza and coronavirus pandemics that have occurred in the 20(th) and 21(st) century, including the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic, the objective of this analysis is to assess the occurrence of disease transmission to HCPs from the performance aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic meta-analysis looking at the odds ratio (OR) of AGP, causing infection among HCPs. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), ProQuest, Cochrane databases, and the Gray literature (ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). In addition, we conducted nondatabase search activities. The search terms used were MERS-CoV, COVID, and SARS combined with provider or healthcare provider. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: RevMan meta-analysis was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Following the search, we reviewed 880 studies, of which six studies were eligible. The estimated odd ratio utilizing a control group of HCPs who were exposed to AGP but did not develop the infection was 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33, 2.57). The OR remained the same when we added another control group who, despite not being exposed to AGP, had developed the infection. The OR remained 1.85 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.55). However, there is an increase in the OR to 1.89 (95% CI: 1.38, 2.59) when we added HCPs who did not use adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) during the procedures to the total estimates.

The incubation period of COVID-19 helps to determine the optimal duration of the quarantine and inform predictive models of incidence curves. Several emerging studies have produced varying results; this systematic review aims to provide a more accurate estimate of the incubation period of COVID-19. Methods. For this systematic review, a literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Scopus/EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering all observational and experimental studies reporting the incubation period and published from 1 January 2020 to 21 March 2020.We estimated the mean and 95th percentile of the incubation period using meta-analysis, taking into account between-study heterogeneity, and the analysis with moderator variables. Results. We included seven studies (N= 792) in the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity (I2 83.0%, p< 0.001)was significantly decreased when we included the study quality and the statistical model used as moderator variables (I2 15%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.6 (95%CI: 5.2 to 6.0) to 6.7 days (95% CI: 6.0 to 7.4) according to the statistical model. The 95th percentile was 12.5 days when the mean age of patients was 60 years, increasing 1 day for every 10 years. Conclusion. Based on the published data reporting the incubation period of COVID-19, the mean time between exposure and onset of clinical symptoms depended on the statistical model used, and the 95th percentile depended on the mean age of the patients.

Some people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in others. This can lead to some people requiring intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of smell or taste, and signs such as oxygen saturation are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19, or select patients for further testing. This is an update of this review, the first version of which published in July 2020. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: For this review iteration we undertook electronic searches up to 15 July 2020 in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they included patients with clinically suspected COVID-19, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies in hospitalised patients were only included if symptoms and signs were recorded on admission or at presentation. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 44 studies including 26,884 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 varied from 3% to 71% with a median of 21%. There were three studies from primary care settings (1824 participants), nine studies from outpatient testing centres (10,717 participants), 12 studies performed in hospital outpatient wards (5061 participants), seven studies in hospitalised patients (1048 participants), 10 studies in the emergency department (3173 participants), and three studies in which the setting was not specified (5061 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild from severe COVID-19, so we present the results for all disease severities together. Fifteen studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. This may have especially influenced the sensitivity of those features used in referral protocols, such as fever and cough. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional 12 studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. This makes it very difficult to judge the validity of the diagnostic accuracy of the signs and symptoms from these included studies. The applicability of the results of this review update improved in comparison with the original review. A greater proportion of studies included participants who presented to outpatient settings, which is where the majority of clinical assessments for COVID-19 take place. However, still none of the studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We found data on 84 signs and symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. Only cough (25 studies) and fever (7 studies) had a pooled sensitivity of at least 50% but specificities were moderate to low. Cough had a sensitivity of 67.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59.8% to 74.1%) and specificity of 35.0% (95% CI 28.7% to 41.9%). Fever had a sensitivity of 53.8% (95% CI 35.0% to 71.7%) and a specificity of 67.4% (95% CI 53.3% to 78.9%). The pooled positive likelihood ratio of cough was only 1.04 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.11) and that of fever 1.65 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.93). Anosmia alone (11 studies), ageusia alone (6 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had sensitivities below 50% but specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a pooled sensitivity of 28.0% (95% CI 17.7% to 41.3%) and a specificity of 93.4% (95% CI 88.3% to 96.4%). Ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 24.8% (95% CI 12.4% to 43.5%) and a specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 81.3% to 96.3%). Anosmia or ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 41.0% (95% CI 27.0% to 56.6%) and a specificity of 90.5% (95% CI 81.2% to 95.4%). The pooled positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.25 (95% CI 3.17 to 5.71) and 4.31 (95% CI 3.00 to 6.18) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The pooled positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was only 2.88 (95% CI 2.02 to 4.09). Only two studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining fever and cough with other symptoms. These combinations had a specificity above 80%, but at the cost of very low sensitivity (< 30%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The majority of individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic accuracy, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out COVID-19. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID-19. The presence of fever or cough, given their high sensitivities, may also be useful to identify people for further testing. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19, are still urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions.","output":"Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Prognosis of patients with COVID-19 depends on the severity of the pulmonary affection. The most severe cases may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with a risk of long-term repercussions on respiratory function and neuromuscular outcomes. The functional repercussions of severe forms of COVID-19 may have a major impact on quality of life, and impair the ability to return to work or exercise. Social inequalities in healthcare may influence prognosis, with socially vulnerable individuals more likely to develop severe forms of disease. We describe here the protocol for a prospective, multicentre study that aims to investigate the influence of social vulnerability on functional recovery in patients who were hospitalised in intensive care for ARDS caused by COVID-19. This study will also include an embedded qualitative study that aims to describe facilitators and barriers to compliance with rehabilitation, describe patients health practices and identify social representations of health, disease and care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The \\"Functional Recovery From Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Due to COVID-19: Influence of Socio-Economic Status\\" (RECOVIDS) study is a mixed-methods, observational, multicentre cohort study performed during the routine follow-up of post-intensive care unit (ICU) functional recovery after ARDS. All patients admitted to a participating ICU for PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and who underwent chest CT scan at the initial phase AND who received respiratory support (mechanical or not) or high-flow nasal oxygen, AND had ARDS diagnosed by the Berlin criteria will be eligible. The primary outcome is the presence of lung sequelae at 6 months after ICU discharge, defined either by alterations on pulmonary function tests, oxygen desaturation during a standardised 6 min walk test or fibrosis-like pulmonary findings on chest CT.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Elective surgical practices have been profoundly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a rapid increase in the utilization of telemedicine. The abrupt initiation of audio-video telehealth visits for all providers of a multidisciplinary clinic on March 19(th) 2020 provided unique circumstances to assess the impact of telemedicine. METHODS: Data from the clinical booking system (new patient and follow-up visits) for all clinical provider types of the multidisciplinary metabolic center from the pre-telehealth, post-telehealth, and a 2019 comparative period were retrospectively reviewed and compared. The primary outcome is the change in patient visit volume for all clinical providers from before to after the initiation of telemedicine for both new patient, and follow-up visits. RESULTS: There were a total of 506 visits (162 new patient visits, and 344 follow-ups) in the pre-telehealth period, versus 413 visits (77 new patient visits, and 336 follow-ups) during the post-telehealth period. After telehealth implementation, new visits for surgeons decreased by 75%. Although follow-up visits decreased by 55.06% for surgeons, there was an increase by 27.36% for advanced practitioners. When surgeons were separated from other practitioners, their follow-up visit rate decrease by 55.06%, compared to a 16.08% increase for the group of all other practitioners (P < 0.0001). Dietitians experienced higher rates of absenteeism with new patient visits (10.00% vs 31.42%, P = 0.0128), whereas bariatricians experienced a decrease in follow-up visit absenteeism (33.33% vs 0%, P = 0.0093). CONCLUSIONS: Although new patient visit volume fell across the board, follow-up visits increased for certain nonsurgical providers. This provides a template for adoption of a multidisciplinary telehealth clinic in a post-pandemic world.","output":"The Impact of Telemedicine Adoption on a Multidisciplinary Bariatric Surgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan City and rapidly spread across the world.

METHODS: Data on the demographic characteristics and clinical findings of the patients admitted at the First Hospital of Changsha from January 1, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were assessed. RESULTS: In this study, there were 8 (3.8%) asymptomatic, 21 (10.0%) mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and 180 (86.1%) pneumonia cases.

Based on insights from routine activity theory (Cohen & Felson 1979), it is likely that COVID-19 will influence victimization rates as people alter their routines and spend more time at home and less time in public. Yet, the pandemic may affect victimization differently depending on the type of crime as street crimes appear to be decreasing while domestic crimes may be increasing. We consider a third type of crime: cybercrime. Treating the pandemic as a natural experiment, we investigate how the pandemic has affected rates of cybervictimization. We compare pre-pandemic rates of victimization with post-pandemic rates of victimization using datasets designed to track cybercrime. After considering how the pandemic may alter routines and affect cybervictimization, we find that the pandemic has not radically altered cyberroutines nor changed cybervictimization rates. However, a model using routine activity theory to predict cybervictimization offers clear support for the theorys efficacy both before and after the pandemic. We conclude by considering plausible explanations for our findings.","output":"Cybercrime in America amid COVID-19: the Initial Results from a Natural Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasound can facilitate diagnosis of joint effusions and help guide management of suspected septic joints.

ANGPTL4 enhanced pulmonary tissue leakiness and exacerbated inflammation-induced lung damage. Treatment of infected mice with neutralizing anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies significantly accelerated lung recovery and improved lung tissue integrity. ANGPTL4-deficient mice also showed reduced lung damage and recovered faster from influenza infection when compared to their wild-type counterparts. Retrospective examination of human lung biopsy specimens from infection-induced pneumonia with tissue damage showed elevated expression of ANGPTL4 when compared to normal lung samples. These observations underscore the important role that ANGPTL4 plays in lung infection and damage and may facilitate future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of influenza pneumonia.","output":"Angiopoietin-like 4 Increases Pulmonary Tissue Leakiness and Damage during Influenza Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: Modern anatomy education is imbued with humanistic values which manifest primarily in the ethical acquisition of bodies for research and education, and respectful treatment of these bodies in anatomy laboratories This humanistic approach is best embedded in the organisation of commemorative ceremonies for body donors This paper presents experiences of preparation and implementation of a commemorative ceremony at Macquarie University, Sydney Local cultural context and university infrastructure were considered when preparing the commemoration It was decided that it will be introduced in stages, starting with a ceremony for anatomy students Students were surveyed about the introduction of the ceremony and their attitudes about its format The results of the survey influenced the format in which the commemoration was conducted The commemoration was introduced in 2019, embedded in the first anatomy lecture Such format was cost effective, caused little disturbance to a complex timetable and was aligned with learning outcomes and students cultural preferences It also enabled easy transition to the online modes of the delivery caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia In the next stage commemorative ceremony will be inclusive of donor family members as well as students","output":"Anatomy Commemoration for Body Donors at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The lockdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact the mental health of people, especially those who are from economically backward and vulnerable sections of society. Mental health can be affected from various reasons including fear of disease transmission, from response measures like social distancing and lockdown, fear of being in quarantine, loneliness, depression due to isolation, fear of losing work and livelihood and avoiding health care due to fear of being infected. Telephonic befriending intervention by non-specialists will be used to provide social and emotional support to the youth from the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY), an initiative of Government of India. This study aims to promote mental wellbeing and reduce depressive symptoms by assisting participants to mobilize social support from family, friends and significant others by using the telephonic befriending intervention. Methods: In this article, we report the design and protocol of a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial. In total, 1440 participants aged 18-35 years, who have recently passed out of the DDU-GKY initiative will be recruited in the study, from 12 project implementing agencies across 6 geographical zones of India. Participants from 6 of these agencies will be assigned into the telephonic befriending intervention arm and the other 6 agency participants will be assigned to the general enquiry phone call arm (control). The primary outcomes of this study are mental wellbeing, depressive symptoms and perceived social support.

Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (Ro) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the hosts central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animals saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten. Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.","output":"Hypothesized behavioral host manipulation by SARS-CoV2 / COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective drug in reducing the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2.

PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: One week prior to graduation, students were required to submit a written assignment describing willingness to practice in light of the ongoing pandemic. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by an Institutional Review Board. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Eighty-four (n = 84) assignments were used for analysis. Of these, 82% (n = 69) of the graduating nurses describe a willingness to voluntarily care for Covid-19 patients. After summarizing narrative responses, two themes emerged including self-assessment of personal and familial risk and conflicting obligations. DISCUSSION: The assessment of risk to self and family are key in determining whether graduating nurses will care for Covid-19 patients. Conflicting obligations may contribute to stress and uncertainty potentially leading to early burnout.

Objectives: To document patterns and costs of ambulatory care in the US before and during the initial stage of the pandemic and to assess how patient, practitioner, community, and COVID-19-related factors are associated with telehealth adoption. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cohort study of working-age persons continuously enrolled in private health plans from March 2019 through June 2020. The comparison periods were March to June in 2019 and 2020. Claims data files were provided by Blue Health Intelligence, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ambulatory encounters (in-person and telehealth) and allowed charges, stratified by characteristics derived from enrollment files, practitioner claims, and community characteristics linked to the enrollee's zip code. Results: A total of 36a?568a?010 individuals (mean [SD] age, 35.71 [18.77] years; 18a?466a?557 female individuals [50.5%]) were included in the analysis. In-person contacts decreased by 37% (from 1.63 to 1.02 contacts per enrollee) from 2019 to 2020. During 2020, telehealth visits (0.32 visit per person) accounted for 23.6% of all interactions compared with 0.3% of contacts in 2019. When these virtual contacts were added, the overall COVID-19 era patient and practitioner visit rate was 18% lower than that in 2019 (1.34 vs 1.64 visits per person). Behavioral health encounters were far more likely than medical contacts to take place virtually (46.1% vs 22.1%). COVID-19 prevalence in an area was associated with higher use of telehealth; patients from areas within the top quintile of COVID-19 prevalence during the week of their encounter were 1.34 times more likely to have a telehealth visit compared with those in the lowest quintile (the reference category). Persons living in areas with limited social resources were less likely to use telehealth (most vs least socially advantaged neighborhoods, 27.4% vs 19.9% usage rates). Per enrollee medical care costs decreased by 15% between 2019 and 2020 (from $358.32 to $306.04 per person per month). During 2020, those with 1 or more COVID-19-related service (1a?470a?721 members) had more than 3 times the medical costs ($1701 vs $544 per member per month) than those without COVID-19-related services. Persons with 1 or more telehealth visits in 2020 had considerably higher costs than persons having only in-person ambulatory contacts ($2214.10 vs $1337.78 for the COVID-19-related subgroup and $735.87 vs $456.41 for the non-COVID-19 subgroup).

The identical structure of the molecule in all living organisms is its main advantage, as it translates into the minimal probability of immunogenicity. Therefore, it is the closest to the ideal preparation used as a filler, due to its biocompatibility and stability at the site of implantation. This paper includes the discussion of the potential mechanisms of adverse immune reactions to HA along with the mechanisms of reaction following vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the literature, we tried to systematize adverse immune reactions with systemic manifestations to HA. The occurrence of unpredictable reactions to hyaluronic acid indicates that they may not be treated as neutral or non-allergenic. The modifications of the chemical structure of HA, additives and individual tendencies in a patient may be the cause of unpredictable reactions, leading to serious health consequences. Preparations of unknown origin, poorly purified, or including bacterial DNA are particularly dangerous. Therefore, long-lasting follow-up of the patient and the selection of a preparation approved by the FDA or EMA are of high importance.

Our epidemiological models show that across 8 countries a further week long delay in imposing lockdown would likely have cost more than half a million lives. Furthermore, those countries which acted more promptly saved substantially more lives than those that delayed. Linking decisions over the timing of lockdown and consequent deaths to economic data, we reveal the costs that national governments were implicitly prepared to pay to protect their citizens as reflected in the economic activity foregone to save lives. These price of life estimates vary enormously between countries, ranging from as low as around $100,000 (e.g. the UK, US and Italy) to in excess of $1million (e.g. Denmark, Germany, New Zealand and Korea). The lowest estimates are further reduced once we correct for under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths.

However, some randomised controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated that women benefited significantly less from intervention than men. It is unclear if this is a true phenomenon or a study sampling artefact, as women were severely under-represented in all RCTs of carotid revascularisation. A systematic review is needed to summarise the existing data and to answer the question of whether a women-only trial for symptomatic patients with ipsilateral carotid stenosis is scientifically necessary and ethically permissible. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically search Medline, Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane libraries for all studies with data from RCTs that included women and compared either endarterectomy with stenting or revascularisation (by means of endarterectomy or stenting) with medical therapy in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Search dates will be restricted to 1991-2018. Two reviewers will conduct screening search results, study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We will include all studies reporting outcomes of interest. Planned subgroup analysis based on revascularisation technique, degree of stenosis and timing of intervention from the index event will be conducted with enough data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This research is exempt of ethics approval as no primary data will be collected. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through national and international-level conferences and scientific meetings.

Anti-arrhythmic medications can be useful to control arrhythmias but can result in bradycardia and haemodynamic compromise. A paced atrial rhythm alongside normal atrioventricular conduction can be helpful to treat bradycardia, prevent arrhythmias, and support cardiac output. CASE SUMMARY: A 55-year-old gentleman with pseudomonas pneumonia, respiratory failure necessitating mechanical haemodynamic support, and subsequent coronary ischaemia presented to the intensive care unit. Paroxysms of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias caused haemodynamic embarrassment and presented an ongoing clinical challenge as anti-arrhythmic medications resulted in bradycardia and Torsade de Pointes. Atrial pacing mediated intrinsic conduction via the His-Purkinje system inhibited ventricular ectopy and further arrhythmia breaking the tachycardiabradycardia cycle; this stabilized the patient, facilitated ongoing intensive therapy unit care and promoted recovery. CONCLUSION: Atrial pacing mediated intrinsic conduction via the His-Purkinje system is an effective approach to suppress ventricular ectopy and sustained arrhythmias whilst protecting the patient from haemodynamically compromising bradycardia.","output":"Atrial pacing to suppress ventricular arrhythmias in the critically ill patients: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Despite COVID-19's devastating repercussions on higher education, scholars have yet to address its impact on Library and Information Science pedagogy.

The current studys objectives were to examine the prevalence of loneliness in such adults along with impact of COVID-19 on neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional status. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in community dwelling cognitively impaired older Veterans (N=41). Demographic data such as age, gender, race, and rurality were collected. Loneliness data were collected with the 3-item Loneliness Questionnaire. Cognition was assessed with the Tele-Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) and functional status of instrumental activities of daily living was assessed with the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Neuropsychiatry symptoms including severity and distress were collected using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and change during COVID was also recorded for each symptom. RESULTS: Demographic characteristics included: mean age of 71.9 (8.6) years, 95.1% male, 46.3% rural, 75.6% Caucasian, and 19.5% African American. Loneliness was prevalent in most participants (62.5%). T-MoCA and FAQ mean scores were 15.1 (4.5) and 10.0 (8.6), respectively.

Its serious impact on maternal and infant health is the main reason for maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. There are many factors affecting pregnancy-induced hypertension. The incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension is different due to different levels of cultural knowledge, health awareness, economic income, nutrition, and medical support. Since its etiology has not been elucidated thus far, there is no known treatment of the disease, and the main principles are spasmolysis, hypotension, expansion, and timely termination of pregnancy. Observe the effect of nimodipine combined with magnesium sulfate on serum heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and pentamer 3 (PTX3) levels in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Ninety-six patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome admitted to our hospital from May 2016 to February 2019 are selected and randomly divided into two groups according to the 1 : 1 principle, with 48 cases in each group. The single drug group is treated with magnesium sulfate, and the combined group is treated with nimodipine combined with magnesium sulfate. Changes in blood pressure, HSP70, PTX3, placental growth factor (PLGF), and vascular endothelial cell injury markers are recorded in the two groups, and adverse reactions and pregnancy outcomes are observed. After treatment, the blood pressure and levels of HSP70, PTX3, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and nitric oxide (NO) in the two groups decreased, and the level of PLGF increased. The diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and levels of HSP70, PTX3, ET-1, and NO in the combined group are lower than those in the single drug group, and the level of PLGF is higher than that in the single drug group (P < 0.05). During the treatment period, the adverse reaction rate of the combined group is 6.25% compared with 8.33% of the single agent group, and the difference is not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Follow-up visits found that the cesarean section rate and abnormal fetal heart rate in the combined group are 16.67% and 4.17%, respectively, which are lower than 35.42% and 16.67% in the single drug group, and the difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05).

This 2'-O-MTase activity is regulated by nsp10. The 2'-O methylation prevents virus detection by cell innate immunity mechanisms and viral translation inhibition by the interferon-stimulated IFIT-1 protein. To unravel the regulation of nsp10/nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity, we used purified MERS-CoV nsp16 and nsp10. First, we showed that nsp16 recruited N7-methylated capped RNA and SAM. The SAM binding promotes the assembly of the enzymatically active nsp10/nsp16 complex that converted 7mGpppG (cap-0) into 7mGpppG2'Om (cap-1) RNA by 2'-OH methylation of N1 in a SAM-dependent manner. The subsequent release of SAH speeds up nsp10/nsp16 dissociation that stimulates the reaction turnover. Alanine mutagenesis and RNA binding assays allowed the identification of the nsp16 residues involved in RNA recognition forming the RNA binding groove (K46, K170, E203, D133, R38, Y47, and Y181) and the cap-0 binding site (Y30, Y132, and H174). Finally, we found that nsp10/nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity is sensitive to known MTase inhibitors, such as sinefungin and cap analogues. This characterization of the MERS-CoV 2'-O-MTase is a preliminary step toward the development of molecules to inhibit cap 2'-O methylation and to restore the host antiviral response. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV codes for a cap 2'-O-methyltransferase that converts cap-0 into cap-1 structure in order to prevent virus detection by cell innate immunity mechanisms. We report the biochemical properties of MERS-CoV 2'O-methyltransferase, which is stimulated by nsp10 acting as an allosteric activator of the nsp16 2'-O-methyltransferase possibly through enhanced RNA binding affinity. In addition, we show that SAM promotes the formation of the active nsp10/nsp16 complex. Conversely, after cap methylation, the reaction turnover is speeded up by cap-1 RNA release and nsp10/nsp16 complex dissociation, at the low intracellular SAH concentration. These results suggest that SAM/SAH balance is a regulator of the 2'-O-methyltransferase activity and raises the possibility that SAH hydrolase inhibitors might interfere with CoV replication cycle. The enzymatic and RNA binding assays developed in this work were also used to identify nsp16 residues involved in cap-0 RNA recognition and to understand the action mode of known methyltransferase inhibitors.","output":"Binding of the Methyl Donor S-Adenosyl-l-Methionine to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2'-O-Methyltransferase nsp16 Promotes Recruitment of the Allosteric Activator nsp10."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Almost as soon as the NCAA announced the cancelation its 2020 March Madness basketball tournament, college administrators began moving to cut sports from their schools portfolios.

RESULTS: Usually, infants and children present milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 disease with a better outcome than adults. At variance, some children may be genetically disposed to a more robust inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, similar to Kawasaki disease.

CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review identifies several risk factors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19-infected inpatients that are often available in the outpatient and primary care settings: increasing age, increased CRP or procalcitonin, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased oxygen saturation, dyspnea on presentation, and the presence of comorbidities. Future research to develop clinical prediction models and rules should include these predictors as part of their core data set to develop and validate pragmatic outpatient risk scores.","output":"Primary Care Relevant Risk Factors for Adverse Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dear editor, We read with great interest the article titled ?Radiological approaches to COVID-19 pneumonia? by Akcay S. et al. in the latest issue of Turk J Med Sci [1].

In humans, these family of viruses can cause the respiratory infections from mild form to fatal forms. It is preferably called as coronavirus. Formally it known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) and this disease is called as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is infectious in humans and world health organization has announced that Covid-19 as a pandemic disease. Tocilizumab is a biological agent which inhibits the cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6 inhibitor). As SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the development of cytokine storm syndrome, the drug tocilizumab seems to have positive effect in patients with covid-19. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To analyze and review the possible effects and efficacy of the tocilizumab (monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors) in SARS-CoV-2 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search strategy on recent research and review articles is used for the SARS-CoV-2 disease and their characteristics. Furthermore we have analyzed most recent research article on monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors (tocilizumab) and their possible clinical effects in Covid-19 and their clinical trials on Covid-19 patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Covid-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is a life threatening condition which can give rise to fatal outcomes if left untreated. However there are no approved treatment for covid-19 globally. Furthermore we can conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with worsening of lung conditions characterized by interstitial pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of cytokine storm syndrome. According to available research data tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-human monoclonal antibody of IgG1&#964; (gamma 1, kappa) can improve patient's condition from cytokine storm syndrome by inhibiting the IL-6 (Interleukin 6) receptors. The rational use of the tocilizumab in severe and critically ill covid-19 patients can prevent the development of irreversible lung injury and death of the patient. Three retrospective studies of Xiaoling Xu et al., Pan luo et al. and Paola Tonaiti et al. has shown the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe and critically ill covid-19 patients. However we need more randomized research studies with significant number of patients which can confirm the promising results on tocilizumab treatment in covid-19 patients and even ongoing clinical trails such as TOSCA, COVACTA results has not been published yet which are expected to give better and more significant results on tocilizumab's effectiveness and safety.","output":"Tocilizumab in Sars-cov-2 Patients with the Syndrome of Cytokine Storm; a Narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determinants of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the development of well-standardized, reproducible antibody assays to be utilized in concert with clinical trials to establish correlates of risk and protection. This need has led to the appearance of a variety of neutralization assays used by different laboratories and companies. Using plasma samples from COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild-to-moderate disease from a localized outbreak in a single region of the western US, we compared three platforms for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization: assay with live SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus assay utilizing lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging, and a surrogate ELISA test. Vero, Vero E6, HEK293T cells expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and TZM-bl cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were evaluated. Live-virus and LV-pseudovirus assay with HEK293T cells showed similar geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging 141-178, but VSV-pseudovirus assay yielded significantly higher GMT (310 95%CI 211-454; p < 0.001). Fifty percent neutralizing dilution (ND50) titers from live-virus and all pseudovirus assay readouts were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81-0.89). ND50 titers positively correlated with plasma concentration of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) (r = 0.63-0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein IgG (r = 0.46-0.73). There was a moderate positive correlation between age and spike (Spearman's rho=0.37, p=0.02), RBD (rho=0.39, p=0.013) and nucleoprotein IgG (rho=0.45, p=0.003).

The Swiss Federal Council prescribed a lockdown of nonessential businesses. Students and employees of higher education institutions had to install home offices and participate in online lectures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to evaluate lifestyle habits, such as physical activity (PA), sitting time, nutritional habits (expressed as median modified Mediterranean Diet Score [mMDS]), alcohol consumption habits, and sleeping behavior during a 2-month period of confinement and social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were students and employees of a Swiss university of applied sciences. METHODS: All students and employees from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Department of Health Professions (ie, nursing, nutrition and dietetics, midwifery, and physiotherapy divisions) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey during the COVID-19 confinement period. Information on the lifestyle dimensions of PA, sitting time, nutritional and alcohol consumption habits, and sleep behavior was gathered using adaptations of validated questionnaires. Frequency analyses and nonparametric statistical methods were used for data analysis. Significance was set at 5% &#945; level of error. RESULTS: Prevalence of non-health-enhancing PA was 37.1%, with participants of the division of physiotherapy showing the lowest prevalence. Prevalence of long sitting time (>8 hours/day) was 36.1%. The median mMDS was 9, where the maximal score was 15, with participants of the division of nutrition and dietetics being more adherent to a Mediterranean diet as compared to the other groups. Prevalence of nonadherence to the Swiss alcohol consumption recommendations was 8.3%. Prevalence of low sleeping quality was 44.7%, while the median sleeping duration was 8 hours, which is considered healthy for adult populations. CONCLUSIONS: In the group analysis, differences in PA, sitting time, and mMDS were observed between different divisions of health professions as well as between Bachelor of Science students, Master of Science students, and employees. Therefore, public health messages regarding healthy lifestyle habits during home confinement should be more group specific. The results of this study may provide support for the implementation of group-specific health promotion interventions at universities in pandemic conditions.

However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease. In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity. METHODS: We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms. We followed up patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected 24 hours apart. We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4  3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3  2.2 bowel movements per day.

Here we examined the functionality of classical CD14+ monocytes as a main myeloid cell component in well-defined cohorts of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 during the acute phase of infection and compared them to that of healthy individuals. We found that ex vivo isolated CD14+ monocytes from mild and moderate COVID-19 patients display specific patterns of costimulatory and inhibitory receptors that clearly distinguish them from healthy monocytes, as well as altered expression of histone marks and a dysfunctional metabolic profile. Decreased NFB activation in COVID-19 monocytes ex vivo is accompanied by an intact type I IFN antiviral response. Subsequent pathogen sensing ex vivo led to a state of functional unresponsiveness characterized by a defect in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, NFB-driven cytokine responses and defective type I IFN response in moderate COVID-19 monocytes. Transcriptionally, COVID-19 monocytes switched their gene expression signature from canonical innate immune functions to a pro-thrombotic phenotype characterized by increased expression of pathways involved in hemostasis and immunothrombosis. In response to SARS-CoV-2 or other viral or bacterial components, monocytes displayed defects in the epigenetic remodelling and metabolic reprogramming that usually occurs upon pathogen sensing in innate immune cells.

The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate during the three-month study period was 15.4 % (1123/7285), spanning April-June 2020. The majority of patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were asymptomatic, with 29.5 % of patients symptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of presentation. Asymptomatic patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were significantly younger than symptomatic patients with the same results (average 37.6 vs. 58.4, p = 0.003). Similar proportions of prior SARS-CoV-2 positivity were noted among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (38.5 % vs. 33.3 %, p = 0.82).

The non-pregnant patients were more likely to have chronic diseases (p = 0.035) and to be hospitalized (p < 0.001). Only one patient (1.9%) aged 60 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal secretions. Mean gestational age at the diagnosis of COVID-19 of the pregnant group was 32.3  7.8 weeks. Thirteen patients delivered during the study period; all delivered at term without obstetric complications and all neonates were healthy. Conclusions: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the vaginal secretions of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is rare. Vaginal colonization may occur during the viremia phase of the disease, although infectivity from vaginal colonization needs to be proven.","output":"Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Vaginal Secretions of Women with COVID-19: A Prospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper focuses on an emergency basic income (EBI) as a tool for avoiding financial insecurity during the time of pandemic.

Therefore, we have started studying on the characteristics of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to know about the truth of infectious disease and our future. After detailed studies on the characteristics of the SIR model for the various parameter dependencies with respect to such as the outing restriction (lockdown) ratio and vaccination rate, we have finally noticed that the second term (isolation term) in the differential equation of the number of the infected is quite similar to the \\"helium ash particle loss term\\" in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy, we have found that isolation of the infected is not actively controlled in the SIR model. Then we introduce the isolation control time parameter q and have studied its effect on this pandemic. Required isolation time to terminate the COVID-19 can be estimated by this proposed method. To show this isolation control effect, we choose Tokyo for the model calculation because of high population density. We determine the reproduction number and the isolation ratio in the initial uncontrolled phase, and then the future number of the infected is estimated under various conditions. If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3~8 days by widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer. We consider this isolation time control might be the only solution to overcome the pandemic when vaccine is not available.","output":"Suppression of COVID-19 infection by isolation time control based on the SIR model and an analogy from nuclear fusion research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed many areas of public health preparedness that are lacking, especially in lower- and middle-income countries.

This review discusses the pertinent spectrum and clinical data of lefamulin (Xenleta?), with a focus on potential real-world use. RECENT FINDINGS: Lefamulin is a novel pleuromutilin antibiotic that obtained Food and Drug Administration labeling for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in 2019. Lefamulin is available in both intravenous and oral formulations, and it inhibits bacterial protein synthesis inhibition through interactive binding to unique sites of the peptidyl transferase center of the 50s bacterial ribosome subunit. Resistance, including cross-resistance with other antibiotics, is infrequent. Lefamulin demonstrates activity against most Gram-positive pathogens and other organisms commonly associated with CABP, i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Lefamulin may also be an option for serious public health threats like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and multi-drug-resistant organisms associated with sexually transmitted infections, e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium. Lefamulin lacks activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacterales, most anaerobes, and E. faecalis. In Phase III trials, lefamulin monotherapy was non-inferior to moxifloxacin with or without linezolid for CABP.

Approach: We conducted follow-up telephone interviews to an online needs assessment survey to identify a learner definition for wellness and to validate five wellness domains, including social, mental, physical, intellectual, and occupational wellness. Using purposive and maximal variation sampling, 27 students were interviewed from JulyCAugust 2020. Thematic analysis was performed using a deductive thematic approach to qualitative analysis. Outcomes: Medical learners defined wellness as a general [holistic] sense of personal well-being C the opportunity to be and to do what they most need and value. Learners validated all five wellness domains for medical education. Learners acknowledged the need for an adoptable and adaptable holistic framework for wellness in medical education. Next steps: We recommend academic medical institutions consider learner wellness a key component of medical education to cultivate learners as a competent collective of self-reliant, scholarly experts.

This systematic review aims to identify quality indicators for successful transition to adult care which can be applied across chronic physical and/or mental illnesses. METHODS Published literature will be searched using MEDLINE, Embase and CINHAL from earliest available date to July 2021. Grey literature will be searched using the Grey Matters tool. Using a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, followed by full-text review. Disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. Study selection and data extraction will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols. Study appraisal will be completed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation for Quality Indicators instrument. Extracted quality indicators will be categorised into a conceptual framework. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Results from this review will offer novel insights into quality indicators that may be used to measure and evaluate transition success across conditions, which will be disseminated via a Canadian transition collaborative, workshops and peer-reviewed publication. Extracted quality indicators will be further prioritised in a Delphi study with patients, caregivers and providers.

Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of stress and poor sleeping quality among medical students and the association between them. METHOD This cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Jordan on second- and third-year medical students. The questionnaire consisted of: 1) Demographics; 2) The assessment tools which were Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index (PSQI) and Kessler Psychological Distress Status (K10). Binary logistic regression, chi-square and linear regression were used to investigate the association between PSQI, K10, and their determinants. RESULTS The mean for PSQI score was 6.76  3.32. PSQI scores interpretation revealed that 61.7% of the 282 participants of this study were poor sleepers. Logistic regression results showed that only the category of not napping at all from the napping hours variable was significantly associated with sleeping quality. Furthermore, the mean of K10 scores was 24.5  8.5. K10 scores revealed that 66.3% of the participants were stressed. Logistic regression results showed that gender and regular exercise were significantly associated with psychological distress. Additionally, chi-square test, logistic regression and linear regression showed that PSQI was significantly associated with K10 (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS Stress and poor sleeping quality in medical students at the University of Jordan were highly prevalent and strongly associated. What determined PSQI was daytime napping, and for K10 were regular exercise and gender.

Over recent years, drug repurposing has been accomplished as an important opportunity in drug development as it shortens the time consumed for development, besides sparing the cost and the efforts exerted in the research and development process. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: The FDA-approved antiparasitic drug, nitazoxanide (NTZ), has been found to have antiviral activity against different viral infections such as coronaviruses, influenza, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and other viruses signifying its potential as a broad spectrum antiviral drug. Moreover, it has been recently reported that NTZ exhibited in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at a small micromolar concentration. Additionally, NTZ suppresses the production of cytokines emphasizing its potential to manage COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. Furthermore, the reported efficacy of NTZ to bronchodilate the extremely contracted airways can be beneficial in alleviating COVID-19-associated symptoms. SHORT CONCLUSION: All these findings, along with the high safety record of the drug, have gained our interest to urge conductance of clinical trials to assess the potential benefits of using it in COVID-19 patients. Thus, in this summarized article, we review the antiviral activities of NTZ and highlight its promising therapeutic actions that make the drug worth clinical trials.","output":"Drug repurposing of nitazoxanide: can it be an effective therapy for COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Outpatient physicians need guidance to support their clinical decisions regarding management of patients with COVID-19, in particular whether to hospitalize a patient and if managed as an outpatient, how closely to follow them. Objective To develop and prospectively validate a clinical prediction rule to predict the likelihood of hospitalization for outpatients with COVID-19 that does not require laboratory testing or imaging. Design Derivation and temporal validation of a clinical prediction rule, and prospective validation of two externally derived clinical prediction rules. Setting Primary and Express care clinics in a Pennsylvania health system. Participants Patients 12 years and older presenting to outpatient clinics who had a positive polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19. Main outcomes and measures Classification accuracy (percentage in each risk group hospitalized) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Overall, 7.4% of outpatients in the early derivation cohort (5843 patients presenting before 3/1/21) and 5.5% in the late validation cohort (3806 patients presenting 3/1/21 or later) were ultimately hospitalized. We developed and temporally validated three risk scores that all included age, dyspnea, and the presence of comorbidities, adding respiratory rate for the second score and oxygen saturation for the third. All had very good overall accuracy (AUC 0.77 to 0.78) and classified over half of patients in the validation cohort as very low risk with a 1.7% or lower likelihood of hospitalization. Two externally derived risk scores identified more low risk patients, but with a higher overall risk of hospitalization (2.8%). Conclusions and relevance Simple risk scores applicable to outpatient and telehealth settings can identify patients with very low (1.6% to 1.7%), low (5.2% to 5.9%), moderate (14.7% to 15.6%), and high risk (32.0% to 34.2%) of hospitalization.

The current study examined the effect of task difficulty on children's PM predictions, actual performance, and postdictions and relations among episodic memory metamemory, metacognitive control, and executive functioning. Children aged 4 to 6 years (N = 131) made PM predictions, completed an easy or difficult PM task, and then made PM postdictions. Children also made predictions and postdictions for their performance on an episodic recall task and then completed an independent measure of metacognitive control and two measures of executive function (working memory and inhibition). Results showed that (a) children's PM increased with age and was worse in the difficult PM task condition, (b) PM predictions and postdictions did not increase with age and only PM postdictions were affected by PM task difficulty; (c) children's PM and episodic recall predictions and postdictions were more accurate with age, (d) children's PM postdictions best predicted PM performance, whereas predictions best predicted episodic recall task performance, and (e) children with better metacognitive control had better PM and more accurate PM predictions.

A range of technologies and strategies for pathogen genome enrichment and sequencing are being used by laboratories worldwide, together with different and sometimes ad hoc, analytical procedures for generating genome sequences. A fully integrated analytical process for raw sequence to consensus genome determination, suited to outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is critical to provide a solid genomic basis for epidemiological analyses and well-informed decision making. We have developed a web-based platform and integrated bioinformatic workflows that help to provide consistent high-quality analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data generated with either the Illumina or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Using an intuitive web-based interface, this workflow automates data quality control, SARS-CoV-2 reference-based genome variant and consensus calling, lineage determination and provides the ability to submit the consensus sequence and necessary metadata to GenBank, GISAID and INSDC raw data repositories. We tested workflow usability using real world data and validated the accuracy of variant and lineage analysis using several test datasets, and further performed detailed comparisons with results from the COVID-19 Galaxy Project workflow. Our analyses indicate that EC-19 workflows generate high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Our screening of bat samples collected in Kenya from 2007 to 2010 not only detected RNA from several novel CoVs but, more significantly, identified sequences that were closely related to human CoVs NL63 and 229E, suggesting that these two human viruses originate from bats. We also demonstrated that human CoV NL63 is a recombinant between NL63-like viruses circulating in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats, with the breakpoint located near 5' and 3' ends of the spike (S) protein gene. In addition, two further interspecies recombination events involving the S gene were identified, suggesting that this region may represent a recombination \\"hot spot\\" in CoV genomes.

Among one of the categories that are most affected by SARS-Cov-2 infection are the elderly residents. Despite the need for prompt diagnoses, which are essential to implement all isolation measures necessary to contain the infection spread, deceased subjects in long-term care facilities are still are often diagnosed post-mortem. In this context, our study focuses on the use of post-mortem computed tomography for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, in conjunction with post-mortem swabs. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of post-mortem whole CT-scanning in identifying COVID-19 pneumonia as a cause of death, by comparing chest CT-findings of confirmed COVID-19 fatalities to control cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 24 deceased subjects: 13 subjects coming from long-term care facility and 11 subjects died at home. Whole body CT scans were performed within 48 hours from death in all subjects to evaluate the presence and distribution of pulmonary abnormalities typical of COVID-19-pneumonia, including: ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and pleural effusion to confirm the post-mortem diagnosis. RESULTS: Whole-body CT scans was feasible and allowed a complete diagnosis in all subjects. In 9 (69%) of the 13 cases from long-term care facility the cause of death was severe COVID 19 pneumonia, while GGO were present in 100% of the study population. CONCLUSION: In the context of rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreaks, given that laboratory tests for the novel coronavirus is time-consuming and can be falsely negative, the post-mortem CT can be considered as a reliable and safe modality to confirm COVID-19 pneumonia.

Current treatments include vaccines and drugs that target viral proteins. However, both of these approaches have limitations, as vaccines require yearly development and the rapid evolution of viral proteins gives rise to drug resistance. In consequence additional intervention strategies, that target host factors required for the viral life cycle, are under investigation. Here we employed arrayed whole-genome siRNA screening strategies to identify cell-autonomous molecular components that are subverted to support H1N1 influenza A virus infection of human bronchial epithelial cells. Integration across relevant public data sets exposed druggable gene products required for epithelial cell infection or required for viral proteins to deflect host cell suicide checkpoint activation. Pharmacological inhibition of representative targets, RGGT and CHEK1, resulted in significant protection against infection of human epithelial cells by the A/WS/33 virus.

Although clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are mainly pulmonary, some patients have other systemic manifestations. This study aimed to describe the clinical finding and outcomes in Sudanese patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective observational study is based on documented files that included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in seven selected hospitals inside Khartoum. Clinical manifestations, complications and outcomes were extracted from patients records using an extraction form designed for this study. RESULTS: Data of 243 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed. The mean (SD) age in years was 55.8 (18.4). Out of 116 participants, 27 of them (23.3%) had severe disease, 15 (12.9%) were critically ill. 67.5% of patients were admitted to the hospital within 7 days from onset of symptoms; most of them were admitted to the wards (n = 140,72.5%). Fever (83.2%), cough (70.7%), and shortness of breath (69.2%) were the most commonly recorded clinical manifestations. Sepsis (9.8%) and acidosis (7.8%) were the most frequently reported complications. Death was the final outcome in 21.4% (56/243). Older age and presence of diabetes were found significantly associated with in-hospital death. The laboratory results showed high CRP in 85.6% (119/139), high ferritin in 88.9% (24/27), lactate dehydrogenase had a median of 409.0 (359C760), D-dimer had a median of 3.3 (1.2C16. 6), and 53/105 (50.5%) had low albumin. CONCLUSIONS: Fever was the most mentioned sign among the participants, followed by fatigue. Cough and shortness of breath were the most commonly recorded pulmonary symptoms manifested.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and psychological distress among HCWs during COVID-19. Methods: We invited HCWs from 3 hospitals across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to participate in an anonymous online survey between April 19CMay 3, 2020. The GAD-7 and K10 measures were used to assess anxiety and psychological distress. Logistic regression models assessed associations between knowledge, attitude, worry, and levels of anxiety and psychological distress. Results: A total of 481 HCWs participated in this study. The majority of HCWs were female (73.6%) and aged 25C34 years (52.6%). More than half were nurses (55.7%) and had good knowledge of COVID-19 (86.3%). Over a third (37%) of HCWs reported moderate/severe psychological distress in the K10 measure and moderate/severe anxiety (32.3%) in the GAD-7, with frontline workers significantly reporting higher levels of anxiety (36%). Knowledge of COVID-19 did not predict anxiety and psychological distress, however, HCWs who believed COVID-19 was difficult to treat and those who perceived they were at high risk of infection had worse mental health outcomes. Worry about spreading COVID-19 to family, being isolated, contracting COVID-19 and feeling stigmatized had 1.8- to 2.5-fold increased odds of symptoms of mental health problems. Additionally, HCWs who felt the need for psychological support through their workplace showed increased odds of psychological distress. Conclusion: HCWs in the UAE reported a high prevalence of psychological distress and anxiety while responding to the challenges of COVID-19. The findings from this study emphasize the public, emotional and mental health burden of COVID-19 and highlight the importance for health systems to implement, monitor, and update preventive policies to protect HCWs from contracting the virus while also providing psychological support in the workplace.","output":"Psychological Distress and Anxiety Levels Among Health Care Workers at the Height of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite vaccination programmes and antivirals, influenza remains a prominent cause of morbidity and mortality. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV test is a leading influenza point-of-care test, but its evaluation has been limited to nasopharyngeal samples. In addition, the clinical impacts of Xpress Flu/RSV have not yet been quantified. METHODS We evaluated the performance of Xpress Flu/RSV at three locations in a UK Hospital Trust against an existing laboratory assay. Multiple upper respiratory tract sample types were included. In addition, we calculated time saved by Xpert, and the associations between Xpert use and rates of early patient isolation and antiviral prescription as recorded at the time of the laboratory result being telephoned out. RESULTS 642 patients were included in the diagnostic performance analysis. There were 177 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A, 7 influenza B and 86 RSV. For influenza A, sensitivity and specificity were 96.6% (95% confidence interval 92.8% - 98.8%) and 98.1% (96.4% - 99.1%) respectively. This was sustained across all locations and sample types. The negative predictive value was 98.7% (97.2% - 99.4%). The median amount of time saved was 27.1 hours. Xpert use was associated with six-fold higher rates of isolation and three-fold higher rates of antiviral prescribing by the time the laboratory result was available. Sensitivity for RSV was lower at 86.0% (95% CI: 76.9% - 92.6%). CONCLUSION Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV reliably detects influenza A infection and has significant clinical impacts.

ARDS is documented in severe cases of COVID-19. No effective pharmacological treatments for ARDS are currently available. Dysfunctional immune responses and pulmonary and systemic inflammation are characteristic features of ARDS pathogenesis. Recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of inflammation point to an important role of the vagus-nerve-mediated inflammatory reflex and neural cholinergic signaling. We examined whether pharmacological cholinergic activation using a clinically approved (for myasthenia gravis) cholinergic drug, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine alters pulmonary and systemic inflammation in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. Male C57Bl/6 mice received one intratracheal instillation of LPS or were sham manipulated (control). Both groups were treated with either vehicle or pyridostigmine (1.5 mg/kg twice daily, 3 mg/day) administered by oral gavage starting at 1 h post-LPS and euthanized 24 h after LPS administration. Other groups were either sham manipulated or received LPS for 3 days and were treated with vehicle or pyridostigmine and euthanized at 72 h. Pyridostigmine treatment reduced the increased total number of cells and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in mice with ARDS at 24 and 72 h. Pyridostigmine also reduced the number of macrophages and lymphocytes at 72 h. In addition, pyridostigmine suppressed the levels of TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and IFN- in BALF and plasma at 24 and 72 h. However, this cholinergic agent did not significantly altered BALF and plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Neither LPS nor pyridostigmine affected BALF IFN- and IL-10 levels at 24 h post-LPS. In conclusion, treatments with the cholinergic agent pyridostigmine ameliorate pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses in mice with endotoxin-induced ARDS. Considering that pyridostigmine is a clinically approved drug, these findings are of substantial interest for implementing pyridostigmine in therapeutic strategies for ARDS.","output":"The Cholinergic Drug Pyridostigmine Alleviates Inflammation During LPS-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is now entering its 9th month of combat against a pandemic of deadly pneumonia.

However, iNATs can often generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false-positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false-negative results. Multiplex assays targeting different regions of the analyte and logical signal readout using sequence-specific probes can help to reduce both false negatives and false positives. Here, we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on a non-sequence-specific readout into individual and multiplex one-pot assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We describe both fluorescence-based and Boolean logic-gated colorimetric lateral flow readout methods and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva.IMPORTANCE One of the key approaches to treatment and control of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, is accurate and rapid diagnostics that is widely deployable in a timely and scalable manner. To achieve this, it is essential to go beyond the traditional gold standard of quantitative PCR (qPCR) that is often faced with difficulties in scaling due to the complexity of infrastructure and human resource requirements. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), have been long pursued as ideal, low-tech alternatives for rapid, portable testing. However, isothermal approaches often suffer from false signals due to employment of nonspecific readout methods. We describe general principles for rapidly converting nonspecifically read LAMP assays into assays that are read in a sequence-specific manner by using oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes. We also demonstrate that inclusion of OSD probes in LAMP assays maintains the simplicity of one-pot assays and a visual yes/no readout by using fluorescence or colorimetric lateral-flow dipsticks while providing accurate sequence-specific readout and the ability to logically query multiplex amplicons for redundancy or copresence. These principles not only yielded high-surety isothermal assays for SARS-CoV-2 but might also aid in the design of more sophisticated molecular assays for other analytes.","output":"High-Surety Isothermal Amplification and Detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to limited capacity, health care systems worldwide have been put in challenging situations since the emergence of COVID-19.

Included articles were peer-reviewed, qualitative studies, reporting on the perceived factors influencing physical activity levels of independently mobile community-dwelling adults, greater than 3 months post stroke. DATA EXTRACTION Data extracted included location, study aim, design, participant and recruitment information and how data were collected and analysed. DATA SYNTHESIS Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify meanings and patterns, generate codes and develop themes. Five main themes were identified: (i) Social networks are important influencers of physical activity; (ii) Participation in meaningful activities rather than 'exercise' is important; (iii) Self-efficacy promotes physical activity and physical activity enhances self-efficacy; (iv) Pre-stroke identity related to physical activity influences post-stroke physical activity; and (v) Formal programmes are important for those with low self-efficacy or a sedentary pre-stroke identity. CONCLUSIONS Physical activity levels in stroke survivors are influenced by social activities and support, pre-stroke identity, self-efficacy levels and completion of activities that are meaningful to stroke survivors.","output":"Personal and social factors that influence physical activity levels in community-dwelling stroke survivors: A systematic review of qualitative literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major breakthroughs and disruptive methods in disease treatment today owe their thanks to our inch by inch developing conception of the infinitive aspects of medicine since the very beginning, among which, the role of the regenerative medicine can on no account be denied, a branch of medicine dedicated to either repairing or replacing the injured or diseased cells, organs, and tissues.

Br J Dermatol 2021; 185:363C370. Many infectious diseases vary from season to season. We set out to discover whether sunlight might affect the risk of death from COVID\\\\19, and whether this might occur independently of vitamin D production. We carried out three independent analyses in the USA, in Italy and in England. We gathered data on deaths from COVID\\\\19 in the early months of 2020. In each country these were recorded in small geographical areas such as counties. We estimated total ultraviolet (UV) exposure from satellite data for each of these areas and excluded from analysis those locations where we predicted that the intensity and wavelengths of sunlight would make vitamin D. We constructed a mathematical model showing the link between UV and COVID death that took into account other risks of catching COVID (such as population density and the proportion of the population who have COVID), and then the risk of dying from COVID (such as age, ethnicity, air pollution, social deprivation). Having taken these factors into account, we found that in each country, higher levels of UV from sunlight are associated with a lower risk of dying from COVID\\\\19. This effect does not appear to be caused by vitamin D production and was most marked in England where the background UV levels are lower. We do not know how sunlight might reduce COVID death but UVA (longer wavelength UV) and its effect on the skin may be important. We think this needs to be studied and may be relevant to public health advice during this pandemic.","output":"Sunlight separately from vitamin D is associated with a lower risk of death from COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zinc deficiency is linked to poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients while clinical trials with Zinc demonstrate better clinical outcome.

Daily increase in cases of COVID-19 patients worldwide and limited number of available detection kits pose difficulty in identifying the presence of disease. Therefore, at this point of time, necessity arises to look for other alternatives. Among already existing, widely available and low-cost resources, X-ray is frequently used imaging modality and on the other hand, deep learning techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performances in computer-aided medical diagnosis. Therefore, an alternative diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 cases utilizing available resources and advanced deep learning techniques is proposed in this work. The proposed method is implemented in four phases, viz., data augmentation, preprocessing, stage-I and stage-II deep network model designing. This study is performed with online available resources of 1215 images and further strengthen by utilizing data augmentation techniques to provide better generalization of the model and to prevent the model overfitting by increasing the overall length of dataset to 1832 images. Deep network implementation in two stages is designed to differentiate COVID-19 induced pneumonia from healthy cases, bacterial and other virus induced pneumonia on X-ray images of chest. Comprehensive evaluations have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with both (i) training-validation-testing and (ii) 5-fold cross validation procedures. High classification accuracy as 97.77%, recall as 97.14% and precision as 97.14% in case of COVID-19 detection shows the efficacy of proposed method in present need of time.

In this manuscript, we prove that the method of using the cumulative CFR is static and does not reflect the trend according to the daily change per unit of time. METHODS: A proportion meta-analysis was carried out on CFR in every country reporting COVID-19 cases. Based on the results, we performed a meta-analysis for global COVID-19 CFR. Each analysis was performed on two different calculations of CFR: according to calendar date and according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case. We thus explored an innovative and original calculation of CFR concurrently based on the date of the first confirmed case as well as on a daily basis. RESULTS: For the first time, we showed that using meta-analyses, according to calendar date and days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case were different. CONCLUSION: We propose that CFR according to days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case might be a better predictor of the current CFR of COVID-19 and its kinetics.","output":"Estimation of global case fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using meta-analyses: Comparison between calendar date and days since the outbreak of the first confirmed case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare industry is strongly influenced by new digital technologies.

However, no study has evaluated the risk of SAH in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed data from 62 health care facilities using the Cerner de-identified COVID-19 dataset. RESULTS: There were 86 (0.1%) and 376 (0.2%) patients with SAH among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of SAH in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.4-0.7, P < 0.0001) after adjusting for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, and nicotine dependence/tobacco use. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.1% vs. 21.3%, P < 0.0001), acute kidney injury (43% vs. 27.7%, P = 0.0005), septic shock (44.2% vs. 20.7%, P < 0.0001), and respiratory failure (64.0% vs. 39.1%, P < 0.0001) were significantly higher among patients with SAH and COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19.

Due to their clinical significance, we explored disease associations of the APOE genotypes using a hypothesis-free, data-driven, phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach. METHODS We used data from the UK Biobank to screen for associations between APOE genotypes and over 950 disease outcomes using genotype 33 as a reference. Data was restricted to 337,484 white British participants (aged 37-73 years). FINDINGS After correction for multiple testing, PheWAS analyses identified associations with 37 outcomes, representing 18 distinct diseases. As expected, 34 and 44 genotypes associated with increased odds of AD (p  7.6  10-46), hypercholesterolaemia (p  7.1  10-17) and ischaemic heart disease (p  2.3  10-4), while 23 provided protection for the latter two conditions (p  3.7  10-10) compared to 33. In contrast, 4-associated disease protection was seen against obesity, chronic airway obstruction, type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, and liver disease (all p  5.2  10-4) while 22 homozygosity increased risks of peripheral vascular disease, thromboembolism, arterial aneurysm, peptic ulcer, cervical disorders, and hallux valgus (all p  6.1  10-4). Sensitivity analyses using brain neuroimaging, blood biochemistry, anthropometric, and spirometric biomarkers supported the PheWAS findings on APOE associations with respective disease outcomes.

This presents a major burden to health systems and to society in South Africa. Collectively, these conditions are overwhelming public healthcare. This is happening when the country has embarked on a journey to universal health coverage, hence the need to estimate the cost of overweight and obesity. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the healthcare cost associated with treatment of weight-related conditions from the perspective of the South African public sector payer. METHODS: Using a bottom-up gross costing approach, this study draws data from multiple sources to estimate the direct healthcare cost of overweight and obesity in South Africa. Population Attributable Fractions (PAF) were calculated and multiplied by each diseases total treatment cost to apportion costs to overweight and obesity. Annual costs were estimated for 2020. RESULTS: The total cost of overweight and obesity is estimated to be ZAR33,194 million in 2020. This represents 15.38% of government health expenditure and is equivalent to 0.67% of GDP. Annual per person cost of overweight and obesity is ZAR2,769. The overweight and obesity cost is disaggregated as follows: cancers (ZAR352 million), cardiovascular diseases (ZAR8,874 million), diabetes (ZAR19,861 million), musculoskeletal disorders (ZAR3,353 million), respiratory diseases (ZAR360 million) and digestive diseases (ZAR395 million). Sensitivity analyses show that the total overweight and obesity cost is between ZAR30,369 million and ZAR36,207 million. CONCLUSION: This analysis has demonstrated that overweight and obesity impose a huge financial burden on the public health care system in South Africa. It suggests an urgent need for preventive, population-level interventions to reduce overweight and obesity rates.

The questionnaire included 40 items relating to responder demographics, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) care structure, ventilated patient profile, work habits, and potential future practice improvements. Results 66 questionnaires (70%) were returned (Spain, 36;Portugal, 30). The majority of respondents were physicians (Spain, 95%;Portugal, 63%). Overall, 83% of hospitals had a dedicated NIV unit (Spain, 100%;Portugal, 63%). The most common indication for HMV was neuromuscular disorders in Spain and obstructive diseases in Portugal. Homecare providers (HCPs) and pulmonologists were usually responsible for managing HMV;HCPs were involved more often in Portugal. Choice of ventilator was most often based on usage hours/day;the most important device features were ease of use (Spain) and adjustment range (Portugal). HMV monitoring practices varied between countries. Telemonitoring was used more often in Portugal (20%;vs Spain, 3%). Follow-up frequency and practices also differed markedly between Spain and Portugal. Respondents highlighted identification of new patient groups and patient phenotyping to optimize treatment and personalize therapy as future HMV strategies. Conclusions Important differences in the management of HMV were observed between two similar European countries.

The relatively large files require additional files beyond the scope of the original format, to identify sequences and provide random access. Currently, multiple compressors have been developed to archive FASTA files back and forth, but these lack direct access to targeted content or metadata of the archive. Moreover, these solutions are not directly backwards compatible to FASTA files, resulting in limited software integration. Results We designed linux based a toolkit using Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) that virtualises the content of DNA, RNA and protein FASTA archives into the filesystem. This guarantees in-sync virtualised metadata files and offers fast random-access decompression using Zstandard (zstd). The toolkit, FASTAFS, can track all system wide running instances, allows file integrity verification and can provide, instantly, scriptable access to sequence files and is easy to use and deploy. Conclusions FASTAFS is a user-friendly and easy to deploy backwards compatible generic purpose solution to store and access compressed FASTA files, since it offers file system access to FASTA files as well as in-sync metadata files through file virtualisation.

However, cefiderocol has limited activity against Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes like Bacterodies fragilis. In the APEKS-cUTI study, 183 (73%) of 252 patients in the cefiderocol group versus 65 (55%) of 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group achieved the composite outcome of clinical and microbiological eradication of Gram-negative bacteria (treatment difference of 18.58%; 95% CI 8.23C28.92, p = 0.0004) in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). Cefiderocol was non-inferior to imipenem-cilastatin in cUTIs caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter freundii. Cefiderocol required dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment and percentage of time that free drug concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT > MIC) best correlated with clinical outcomes. The most common adverse events with cefiderocol were gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, or upper abdominal pain.

While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Objective: To provide an early description and characterization of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs, focusing on mode of presentation, presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trajectory, and early outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included children positive for COVID-19 admitted to 46 North American PICUs between March 14 and April 3, 2020. with follow-up to April 10, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prehospital characteristics, clinical trajectory, and hospital outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Results: Of the 48 children with COVID-19 admitted to participating PICUs, 25 (52%) were male, and the median (range) age was 13 (4.2-16.6) years. Forty patients (83%) had significant preexisting comorbidities; 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation. Eleven patients (23%) had failure of 2 or more organ systems. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for 1 patient (2%). Targeted therapies were used in 28 patients (61%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (11 patients) or in combination (10 patients). At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults. Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children. These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Children With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection Admitted to US and Canadian Pediatric Intensive Care Units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary highlights novel immunomodulation and vaccine-based research against multiple sclerosis (MS) and reveals the amazing story that triggered this cutting-edge MS research in Greece and worldwide.

However, its applicability and validity have not been evaluated in the Ethiopian context so far. Therefore, we designed this study to assess the reliability and validity of Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale to detect major neurocognitive disorder among older people in Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among selected older people residing in Macedonia institutional care center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The gold standard diagnosis was determined using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for major neurocognitive disorders. Stata v16 statistical software was used for data analysis. Receivers operating curve analysis, correlations, linear regression, and independent t-test were performed with statistically significant associations declared at a p-value of <0.05. Inter-rater, internal consistency reliabilities, content, criterion and construct validities were also determined. RESULTS: A total of 116 individuals participated in the study with a 100% response rate. Most (52.7%) of the participants were male and the mean age in years was 69.9 8. The Cronbachs alpha for RUDAS was 0.7 with an intra-class correlation coefficient value of 0.9. RUDAS has an area under the receivers operating curve of 0.87 with an optimal cutoff value of  22. At this cutoff point, RUDAS has sensitivity and specificity of 92.3 and 75.3 with positive and negative likelihood ratios as well as positive and negative predictive values of 3.7, 0.1, 65.5%, and 91.5%, respectively. There has also been a significant difference in the mean scores of RUDAS among the two diagnostic groups showing good construct validity.

However, the yield of these citrus crops is often reduced due to the damage of various pests and diseases. In order to mitigate these problems, several convolutional neural networks were applied to detect them. It is of note that the performance of these selected models degraded as the size of the target object in the image decreased. To adapt to scale changes, a new feature reuse method named bridge connection was developed. With the help of bridge connections, the accuracy of baseline networks was improved at little additional computation cost. The proposed BridgeNet-19 achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.47%), followed by the pre-trained VGG-19 (95.01%) and VGG-19 with bridge connections (94.73%). The use of bridge connections also strengthens the flexibility of sensors for image acquisition.

Doppler ultrasonography revealed occlusion of the right brachial and right common carotid artery. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the occlusion of the right brachial and common carotid artery, and revealed pedunculated floating ascending aortic mass. The floating thrombus in ascending aorta is a rare and potentially very dangerous pathological condition. Although aetiology is still unclear, ascending aorta atherosclerosis and coagulation disorder are probably the most common reasons. Hypercoagulable state, high level of antiphospholipid antibody and factor VIII are closely relating with vascular thrombosis. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, increasing evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might produce hypercoagulable state with subsequent thrombosis and thromboembolism. The infection elevated the level of factor VIII in the blood and, consequently, increased the risk of adverse thrombotic and embolic events. Additionally, endothelial inflammation and injury mediated by coronavirus represent an additional risk factor. According to literature, this is the first case of the floating ascending aorta thrombus in the patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The thrombus' fragile structure and high blood velocity through the ascending aorta significantly increases cerebral and peripheral embolization incidence, with potentially fatal outcome. Due to frequent adverse events, urgent surgical extirpation is the best therapy option.

Smartphone users store their personal as well as official data on these devices. Ransomware attackers found it bewitching for their financial benefits. The financial losses due to ransomware attacks are increasing rapidly. Recent studies witness that out of 87% reported cyber-attacks, 41% are due to ransomware attacks. The inability of application-signature-based solutions to detect unknown malware has inspired many researchers to build automated classification models using machine learning algorithms. Advanced malware is capable of delaying malicious actions on sensing the emulated environment and hence posing a challenge to dynamic monitoring of applications also. Existing hybrid approaches utilize a variety of features combination for detection and analysis. The rapidly changing nature and distribution strategies are possible reasons behind the deteriorated performance of primitive ransomware detection techniques. The limitations of existing studies include ambiguity in selecting the features set. Increasing the feature set may lead to freedom of adept attackers against learning algorithms. In this work, we intend to propose a hybrid approach to identify and mitigate Android ransomware. This study employs a novel dominant feature selection algorithm to extract the dominant feature set. The experimental results show that our proposed model can differentiate between clean and ransomware with improved precision. Our proposed hybrid solution confirms an accuracy of 99.85% with zero false positives while considering 60 prominent features. Further, it also justifies the feature selection algorithm used.

Home quarantine, online classes, and the stress surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have triggered increased mental health problems of medical students. Although there has been an increasing literature on depression among medical students, studies focusing on positive psychological resources such as resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic still need to be expanded. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims at assessing depression of medical students taking online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigating the role of coping styles as a mediator between resilience and depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 666 medical students with stratified sampling in Shenyang, Liaoning Province in China was completed between March 20th, 2020 and April 10th, 2020. The participants responded to a self-administered smartphone-based questionnaire which included Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Ego-Resilience scale (ER-89). Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in the participants was 9.6% (64/666) in this study. Regression analysis revealed that grade (the year in which the medical student was in their training), how well they adapted to online classes, their levels of resilience, and their coping styles were independent predictors for depression (P<.05). Resilience and positive coping style were negatively related to depression and negative coping style was positively related to depression (P<.01). SEM showed that the effect of resilience on depression was partially mediated by coping styles(P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: It was found in the present study the prevalence of depression was slightly low and coping styles mediated the association between resilience and depression among medical students during COVID-19, which was of significant implications for further study.

This kind of panic spreads and develops through online social networks, and further spreads to the offline environment, which triggers panic buying behavior and has a serious impact on social stability. In order to quantitatively study this behavior, a two-layer propagation model of panic buying behavior under the sudden epidemic is constructed. The model first analyzes the formation process of individual panic from a micro perspective, and then combines the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model to simulate the spread of group behavior. Then, through simulation experiments, the main factors affecting the spread of panic buying behavior are discussed. The experimental results show that: (1) the dissipating speed of individual panics is related to the number of interactions and there is a threshold. When the number of individuals involved in interacting is equal to this threshold, the panic of the group dissipates the fastest, while the dissipation speed is slower when it is far from the threshold; (2) The reasonable external information release time will affect the occurrence of the second panic buying, meaning providing information about the availability of supplies when an escalation of epidemic is announced will help prevent a second panic buying. In addition, when the first panic buying is about to end, if the scale of the second panic buying is to be suppressed, it is better to release positive information after the end of the first panic buying, rather than ahead of the end; and (3) Higher conformity among people escalates panic, resulting in panic buying.

The Omicron variant demonstrates substantial immune evasion, and it is unknown whether additional vaccine doses increase neutralizing capacity versus this variant of concern (VOC) among SOTRs. Methods: Within an observational cohort, 25 SOTRs with low seroresponse underwent anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike and receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin (Ig)G testing using a commercially available multiplex ELISA before and after a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose (D4). Surrogate neutralization (percent angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibition [%ACE2i], range 0%-100% with >20% correlating with live virus neutralization) was measured against full-length spike proteins of the vaccine strain and 5 VOCs including Delta and Omicron. Changes in IgG level and %ACE2i were compared using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Anti-receptor-binding domain and anti-spike seropositivity increased post-D4 from 56% to 84% and 68% to 88%, respectively. Median (interquartile range) anti-spike antibody significantly increased post-D4 from 42.3 (4.9-134.2) to 228.9 (1115.4-655.8) World Health Organization binding antibody units. %ACE2i (median [interquartile range]) also significantly increased against the vaccine strain (5.8% [0%-16.8%] to 20.6% [5.8%-45.9%]) and the Delta variant (9.1% [4.9%-12.8%] to 17.1% [10.3%-31.7%]), yet neutralization versus Omicron was poor, did not increase post-D4 (4.1% [0%-6.9%] to 0.5% [0%-5.7%]), and was significantly lower than boosted healthy controls. Conclusions: Although a fourth vaccine dose increases anti-spike IgG and neutralizing capacity against many VOCs, some SOTRs may remain at high risk for Omicron infection despite boosting.

Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for better understanding the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, firstly, we developed a viral post-translational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of viral PTM data. The VPTMdb contains 912 PTM sites that integrate 414 experimental-confirmed PTM sites with 98 proteins in 45 human viruses manually extracted from 162 publications and 498 PTMs extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Secondly, we investigated the viral PTM sequence motifs, the function of target human proteins, and characteristics of PTM protein domains. The results showed that (i) viral PTMs have the consensus motifs with human proteins in phosphorylation, SUMOylation and N-glycosylation. (ii) The function of human proteins that targeted by viral PTM proteins are related to protein targeting, translation, and localization. (iii) Viral PTMs are more likely to be enriched in protein domains. The findings should make an important contribution to the field of virus-human interaction. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylation sites. Finally, an online web server was implemented for users to download viral protein PTM data and predict phosphorylation sites of interest.

While previous research has identified the factors that lead to a lack of shared understanding of NFRs in CSE, we still have a significant gap in understanding how CSE organizations, particularly in remote work, build a shared understanding of NFRs in their software development. We conduct a three-month ethnography-informed case study of a remote CSE organization. Through thematic analysis of our qualitative data from interviews and observations, we identify a number of practices in developing a shared understanding of NFRs. The collaborative workspace the organization uses for remote interaction is Gather, which simulates physical workspaces, and which our findings suggest allows for informal communications instrumental for building shared understanding. As actionable insights, we discuss our findings in light of proactive practices that represent opportunities for software organizations to invest in building a shared understanding of NFRs in their development.","output":"A Case Study of Building Shared Understanding of Non-Functional Requirements in a Remote Software Organization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The health crisis linked to the COVID-19 epidemic has required lockdown measures in France and changes in practices in dialysis centers. The objective was to assess the depressive and anxiety symptoms during lockdown in hemodialysis patients and their caregivers, to assess their coping strategies during this period and to assess the symptoms of depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress beyond confinement. METHOD: We sent, during lockdown period, between April and May 2020, self-questionnaires to voluntary subjects (patients and caregivers), treated by hemodialysis or who worked in hemodialysis in one of the 14 participating centers in France. We analyzed their perception of dialysis sessions (beneficial or worrying), their stress level (VAS rated from 0 to 10), their anxiety and depressive symptoms (HADS). Factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression were analyzed with multiple logistic regression models. We will look for associations between coping strategies, participant characteristics and symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression using chi-square tests. A second questionnaire was sent out in October to collect symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress beyond confinement. Symptoms will be described and factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression will be analyzed with multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: 669 patients and 325 caregivers agreed to participate. 70% of participants found it beneficial to come to dialysis during confinement. The proportions of subjects with a stress level  6 linked to the epidemic, confinement, fear of contracting COVID-19 and fear of infecting a loved one were respectively 23.9%, 26.2%, 33.4% and 42%. 39.2% presented with certain (13.7%) or doubtful (19.2%) anxious symptoms. 21.2% presented a certain (7.9%) or doubtful (13.3%) depressive symptomatology. Age, gender, history of psychological disorders and perception of dialysis sessions were associated with levels of stress, anxiety and depression. 685 subjects participated in the second part of the study (68.9% of the participants of the first part). Analyzes of this data are in progress. CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, in France, the majority of hemodialysis patients and caregivers found it beneficial to come to dialysis. One in 3 subjects had anxiety symptoms and one in 5 subjects had depressive symptoms. It will be interesting to investigate if there was an association between the coping strategies implemented by the participants and their level of stress, anxiety and depression during confinement and to analyze the evolution of the anxiety-depressive symptoms over time.","output":"MO833 PSYCHOLOGICAL REPERCUSSIONS OF THE LOCKDOWN AND THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS IN FRANCE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prolonged Covid-19-related school closures in the UK raised concerns that science teaching and learning at primary level would be negatively impacted This paper reports the findings of phase 1 of a study that the authors are conducting with teachers and parents to explore this issue We found that a significant proportion of teachers were providing less science during lockdown than in the normal school week Teachers, particularly those working in more deprived areas, reported that translating the science curriculum for home learning had been difficult, with concerns around resources, internet access and parental ability to help Some areas of the curriculum posed particular difficulties, leading to a narrowing of topics being taught Both teachers and parents felt that schools prioritised English and maths above science Meanwhile some parents reported that their children had engaged in sophisticated extracurricular activities, bolstered by resources available at home and knowledgeable adult help, but others said that their children had done no science at all Parents who had studied science at post-compulsory level were much more comfortable in helping their children with science home learning These factors combine to create conditions which may exacerbate existing inequalities as to who can access science education and careers","output":"Widening the divide: the impact of school closures on primary science learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated child protection decision-making practices of healthcare-professionals in community-health-services.

Considering their chemo-/radio-resistance, alternative treatment strategies are strongly required, but their development is limited by the paucity of relevant preclinical models. Mutations affecting genes of the SWI/SNF complexes are frequently found in chordomas, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect of epigenetic regulators in this pathology. Twelve PDX models were established and characterized on histological and biomolecular features. Patients whose tumors were able to grow into mice had a statistically significant lower progression-free survival than those whose tumors did not grow after in vivo transplantation (p = 0.007). All PDXs maintained the same histopathological features as patients' tumors. Homozygous deletions of CDKN2A/2B (58.3%) and PBRM1 (25%) variants were the most common genomic alterations found. In the tazemetostat treated PDX model harboring a PBRM1 variant, an overall survival of 100% was observed. Our panel of chordoma PDXs represents a useful preclinical tool for both pharmacologic and biological assessments.

The Grade 9 Career Guidance Project, originally developed as a group-based career development intervention, required radical adaptation into a self-directed, manualized format to offer career guidance to Grade 9 learners from low-income communities amid a global pandemic. The adaptation and continuation of the project was deemed essential as secondary school learners in low-income communities have limited career guidance support. Furthermore, a close collaboration with the teachers at eight resource-constrained South African secondary schools was vital for successful implementation. To assess the success of the adaptation to a self-directed format, a mixed-methods design was employed, and Life Orientation teachers evaluative feedback was solicited (n = 11). Favorable quantitative results were obtained; majority of teachers agreed that learners enjoyed the booklet (manualized format) and that it was deemed an adequate substitute to the previous contact-based format of the Career Guidance Project. This was also confirmed by the qualitative findings revealing teachers satisfaction with the booklets content, specifically that the booklet is complementary to the Life Orientation curriculum. Qualitative findings identified specific contextual barriers that contributed to some learners struggling to use the booklet optimally. The results suggest that it is feasible and acceptable to implement a self-directed career guidance intervention among secondary school learners amid a global pandemic. Teachers recommended ways to integrate the booklet, resources, and contact sessions as a preferred way forward.

Analysis of genome-wide changes in transcription at both promoter-proximal and distal cis-regulatory DNA elements, collectively termed the active cistrome, offers an unbiased assessment of TF activity identifying key pathways regulated in homeostasis or disease. Here, we profiled the active cistrome from peripheral leukocytes of critically ill COVID-19 patients to identify major regulatory programs and their dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We identified TF motifs that track the severity of COVID- 19 lung injury, disease resolution, and outcome. We used unbiased clustering to reveal distinct cistrome subsets delineating the regulation of pathways, cell types, and the combinatorial activity of TFs. We found critical roles for regulatory networks driven by stimulus and lineage determining TFs, showing that STAT and E2F/MYB regulatory programs targeting myeloid cells are activated in patients with poor disease outcomes and associated with single nucleotide genetic variants implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility. Integration with single-cell RNA-seq found that STAT and E2F/MYB activation converged in specific neutrophils subset found in patients with severe disease. Collectively we demonstrate that cistrome analysis facilitates insight into disease mechanisms and provides an unbiased approach to evaluate global changes in transcription factor activity and stratify patient disease severity.","output":"Profiling Transcription Initiation in Peripheral Leukocytes Reveals Severity-Associated Cis-Regulatory Elements in Critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intercalation of layered compounds opens up a vast space of new host-guest hybrids, providing new routes for tuning the properties of materials.

COVID-19 patients may have different degrees of coagulopathy, but the mechanism is not yet clear. We aimed to analyse the relationship between coagulation dysfunction and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 74 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First People's Hospital of Yueyang from 1 January to 30 March 2020 was carried out. According to the coagulation function, 27 cases entered the coagulopathy group and 47 cases entered the control group. A case control study was conducted to analyse the correlation between the occurrence of coagulation dysfunction and liver damage in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), markers of liver damage, were positively correlated with coagulopathy (p = 0.039, OR 2.960, 95% CI 1.055-8.304; and p = 0.028, OR 3.352, 95% CI 1.137-9.187). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ?3-glutamyl transpeptidase (?3-GT), and total bilirubin (TBIL) were not statistically correlated with coagulopathy. According to the diagnosis and treatment plan, the included cases were classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critical. The results showed that the occurrence of coagulation dysfunction had no statistical correlation with the severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Coagulation dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 is closely related to liver damage. A longer course of the disease may cause a vicious circle of coagulopathy and liver damage.

We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of patient data of the Corona Testing Unit (CTU) in Munich, Bavaria, Germany between January 27th, and September 30th, 2020. We analyzed the course of daily patient numbers over time by fitting a negative binomial model with multiple breakpoints. Additionally, we investigated possible influencing factors on patient numbers and characteristics by literature review of policy papers and key informant interviews with individuals involved in the set-up of the CTU. The 3,963 patients included were mostly young (median age: 34, interquartile range: 27C48), female (66.2%), and working in the healthcare sector (77%). For these, 5,314 real-time RT-PCR tests were conducted with 157 (2.94%) positive results. The overall curve of daily tests and positive results fits the re-ported state-wide incidence in large parts but shows multiple breakpoints with considerable trend changes. These can be most fittingly attributed to testing capacities and -strategies and individual risk behavior, rather than public health measures. With the large impact on patient numbers and pre-test probabilities of various strategic and operational factors, we consider the derived re-ported incidence as a poor measurement to base policy decisions on.

Binding and functional neutralization assays and systems serology revealed that the vaccinated NHP developed AS03-dependent multifunctional humoral responses that targeted distinct domains of the spike protein and bound to a variety of Fc receptors mediating immune cell effector functions in vitro. The neutralizing 50% inhibitory concentration titers for pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 were higher than titers for a panel of human convalescent serum samples.

Two days after challenge, vaccinated NHPs showed rapid control of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways. Vaccinated NHPs also had increased spike protein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in the lung as early as 2 days after challenge. Moreover, passive transfer of vaccine-induced IgG to hamsters mediated protection from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

However, they are rare abnormalities (in 1% of non-small cell lung carcinomas) that are typically identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and so screening using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining would be both cost- and time-efficient. METHODS A cohort of lung tumors negative for other common mutations related to targeted therapies were screened to assess the sensitivity and specificity of IHC staining in detecting ROS1 gene rearrangements, enriched by four other cases first identified by FISH. A review of published data was also undertaken. RESULTS IHC staining was 100% sensitive (95% confidence interval: 48-100) and 83% specific (95% confidence interval: 86-100) overall when an h-score higher than 100 was used.

The majority of papers are attributed to the disciplines of MICROBIOLOGY, INFECTIOUS DISEASES, IMMUNOLOGY, NEUROSCIENCES & NEUROLOGY, and VIROLOGY. The co-citation analysis of references shows that recent research has focused on the largest cluster metagenomic next-generation sequencing; the results of the analysis of the highest-cited publications and the citation burst of publications reveal that there is a strong interest stimulated in metagenomic next-generation sequencing. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords indicates that infection, pathogen, diagnosis, gene, virus, polymerase chain reaction, cerebrospinal fluid, epidemiology, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing are the main research priorities in the field of pathogen detection for CNS infections, and the keyword with the highest strength of burst is metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Collaborative network analysis reveals that the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of USA, and XIN WANG and JENNIFER DIEN BARD are the most influential country, institution, and researchers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Exploring more advanced laboratory assays to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathogens is essential for CNS infection research. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing is emerging as a novel useful unbiased approach for diagnosing infectious diseases of the CNS.","output":"Trends and Developments in the Detection of Pathogens in Central Nervous System Infections: A Bibliometric Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze computed tomography (CT) features of symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Ninety-five symptomatic patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from 1 May to 14 July 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Follow-up CT findings and their distributions were analyzed and compared from symptom onset to late-stage disease. RESULTS: Among all patients, 15.8% had unilateral lung disease and 84.2% had bilateral disease with slight right lower lobe predilection (47.4%). Regarding lesion density, 49.4% of patients had pure ground glass opacity (GGO) and 50.5% had GGO with consolidation. Typical early-stage patterns were bilateral lesions in 73.6% of patients, diffuse lesions (41.0%), and GGO (65.2%). Pleural effusion occurred in 13.6% and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 11.5%. During intermediate-stage disease, 47.4% of patients showed GGO as the disease progressed; however, consolidation was the predominant finding (52.6%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia manifested on lung CT scans with bilateral, peripheral, and right lower lobe predominance and was characterized by diffuse bilateral GGO progressing to or coexisting with consolidation within 1 to 3 weeks. The most frequent CT lesion in the early, intermediate, and late phases was GGO. Consolidation appeared in the intermediate phase and gradually increased, ending with reticular and lung fibrosis-like patterns.","output":"Chest computed tomography imaging features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown in India begins from 25 March and continues until 31 May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Due to such an extended period of lockdown for about more than 2 months resulted in 1.38 billion populations restricted themselves from mass activities that contribute to air pollution. Thus, through our quantitative approach and trend analysis, the study aims to evaluate the changes in the level of PM(2.5) as a major pollutant for the top ten polluted cities in India, with a special emphasis on finding what happened to its concentration after the lockdown ended. Thus, to better understand the nature of variation in PM(2.5), we divide the entire 7 months into three periods for our analysis, i.e., before lockdown (1 January to 24 March), during lockdown (25 March to 31 May), and post-lockdown or unlock 1 and 2 (1 June to 31 July). Our investigation reveals that before lockdown, all the top polluted cities of India violating the national standard of PM(2.5), as the lockdown begins interestingly, all cities show a momentous reduction in PM(2.5) concentration. Further, surprisingly we found that after the post-lockdown period, the concentration of PM(2.5) was reduced to minimal, as the average concentration of PM(2.5) for all the cities is below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The study reveals that the lockdown has a consequence in improving overall air quality for the top polluted cities in India and further lockdown in the future with proper planning should be considered an alternative approach to restrain excessive emissions.","output":"Reduction in concentration of PM(2.5) in Indias top most polluted cities: with special reference to post-lockdown period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present article highlights morbidity and mortality trends of Covid 19 in the last 3 months in top 10 countries of the world.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been postulated to play a key role in treating ovarian ageing. METHODS: We used macaque ovarian ageing models to observe the structural and functional changes after juvenile BMMSC treatment. Moreover, RNA-seq was used to analyse the ovarian transcriptional expression profile and key pathways through which BMMSCs reverse ovarian ageing. RESULTS: In the elderly macaque models, the ovaries were atrophied, the regulation ability of sex hormones was reduced, the ovarian structure was destroyed, and only local atretic follicles were observed, in contrast with young rhesus monkeys. Intravenous infusion of BMMSCs in elderly macaques increased ovarian volume, strengthened the regulation ability of sex hormones, reduced the degree of pulmonary fibrosis, inhibited apoptosis, increased density of blood vessels, and promoted follicular regeneration. In addition, the ovarian expression characteristics of ageing-related genes of the elderly treatment group reverted to that of the young control group, 1258 genes that were differentially expressed, among which 415 genes upregulated with age were downregulated, 843 genes downregulated with age were upregulated after BMMSC treatment, and the top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were significantly enriched in oocyte meiosis and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathways.

After one year of the pandemic, the initial evidence on health system responses begins to consolidate, and there is a need to identify and synthesise experiences of responding to COVID-19 among healthcare professionals and other health system stakeholders. This systematic review of primary qualitative studies depicts the experiences and perceptions of organisations and actors at multiple levels of health systems internationally in responding to COVID-19. METHODS: Six main databases of biomedical information, public health and health administration research were searched over the period October 1, 2019, to October 21, 2020. Information extracted from included studies was analysed thematically. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were eligible for data extraction. Nine of those studies, of lower methodological quality, were removed from the thematic analysis of study results. Considering the professional level experiences, predominant themes of the studies consisted of the new roles and responsibilities of healthcare workers, burnout and distress, recognition of unseen healthcare workers, and positive changes and emergent solutions amid the crisis. Organisational level findings of the studies included provision of psychological support, COVID-19 as \\"catalyst\\" for change, and exercise of more \\"open\\" leadership by managers and health authorities. Continuous training, regulation of working conditions, providing supportive resources, coordinating a diversity of actors, and reviewing and updating regulations were roles identified at the local health system level. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of frontline healthcare workers have been the focus of attention of the majority of primary qualitative studies as of October 2020. However, organisational and wider system level studies indicate that some responses to COVID-19 have been characterised by increased emphasis on coordination activities by local health system actors, making service adaptations at pace, and reliance on expanded roles of front-line workers.

METHODS: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infections among U.S. Marine Corps recruits who underwent a 2-week quarantine at home followed by a second supervised 2-week quarantine at a closed college campus that involved mask wearing, social distancing, and daily temperature and symptom monitoring. Study volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by means of quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay of nares swab specimens obtained between the time of arrival and the second day of supervised quarantine and on days 7 and 14. Recruits who did not volunteer for the study underwent qPCR testing only on day 14, at the end of the quarantine period. We performed phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes obtained from infected study volunteers to identify clusters and to assess the epidemiologic features of infections. RESULTS: A total of 1848 recruits volunteered to participate in the study; within 2 days after arrival on campus, 16 (0.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 15 of whom were asymptomatic. An additional 35 participants (1.9%) tested positive on day 7 or on day 14. Five of the 51 participants (9.8%) who tested positive at any time had symptoms in the week before a positive qPCR test. Of the recruits who declined to participate in the study, 26 (1.7%) of the 1554 recruits with available qPCR results tested positive on day 14. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified through clinical qPCR testing performed as a result of daily symptom monitoring. Analysis of 36 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from 32 participants revealed six transmission clusters among 18 participants. Epidemiologic analysis supported multiple local transmission events, including transmission between roommates and among recruits within the same platoon. CONCLUSIONS: Among Marine Corps recruits, approximately 2% who had previously had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of supervised quarantine, and less than 2% of recruits with unknown previous status, tested positive by day 14. Most recruits who tested positive were asymptomatic, and no infections were detected through daily symptom monitoring. Transmission clusters occurred within platoons.

Individuals afflicted with CCA often remain asymptomatic until late stages of disease, resulting in very limited possibilities for therapeutic intervention. The emergence of numerous preclinical models in vitro and in vivo has expanded the tool kit for CCA researchers; nonetheless, how these tools can be best applied to understand CCA biology and accelerate drug development requires further scrutiny. Areas covered: The paper reviews the literature on animal and organoid models of CCA (available through PubMed between September 2020 and January 2021) and examines their investigational role in CCA therapeutics. Finally, the potential of these systems for screening therapeutics to improve CCA patient outcomes is illuminated. Expert Opinion: The expansion of CCA models has yielded a diverse and interesting tool kit for preclinical research. However, investigators should consider which tools are best suited to answer key preclinical questions for real progress.

MethodsA community-based cohort study was conducted from May to September 2021 in a selected geographic area in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The estimated sample size was 10,232. We enumerated individuals from all eligible households and periodically updated vaccination and COVID-19 infection data. We computed vaccine effectiveness with its 95% confidence interval for two doses of the Covishield vaccine against any COVID-19 infection. ResultsWe enrolled 69,435 individuals, of which 21,793 were above 45 years. Two dose coverage of Covishield in the 18+ and 45+ age group was 18% and 31%, respectively. The overall incidence of COVID-19 infection was 1099 per 100,000 population. The vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 disease in the []45 age group was 61.3% (95% CI: 43.6 - 73.4) at least two weeks after receiving the second dose of Covishield.

Methods: Clinical studies on the therapeutic effects and safety of CHM for COVID-19 were included. We summarized the general characteristics of included studies, evaluated methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, analyzed the use of CHM, used Revman 5.4 software to present the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the therapeutic effects and safety of CHM. Results: A total of 58 clinical studies were identified including RCTs (17.24%, 10), non-randomized controlled trials (1.72%, 1), retrospective studies with a control group (18.97%, 11), case-series (20.69%, 12) and case-reports (41.38%, 24). No RCTs of high methodological quality were identified. The most frequently tested oral Chinese patent medicine, Chinese herbal medicine injection or prescribed herbal decoction were: Lianhua Qingwen granule/capsule, Xuebijing injection and Maxing Shigan Tang. In terms of aggravation rate, pooled analyses showed that there were statistical differences between the intervention group and the comparator group (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82, six RCTs; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.64, five retrospective studies with a control group), that is, CHM plus conventional western therapy appeared better than conventional western therapy alone in reducing aggravation rate. In addition, compared with conventional western therapy, CHM plus conventional western therapy had potential advantages in increasing the recovery rate and shortening the duration of fever, cough and fatigue, improving the negative conversion rate of nucleic acid test, and increasing the improvement rate of chest CT manifestations and shortening the time from receiving the treatment to the beginning of chest CT manifestations improvement. For adverse events, pooled data showed that there were no statistical differences between the CHM and the control groups.

METHODS Sixty patients underwent attempted B-II TLDG from 2011 through 2013. Patients who underwent B-II LADG prior to 2011 were matched to TLDG cases for demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and TNM stage. Perioperative and short-term surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Clinicopathological characteristics of both groups were comparable. The B-II TLDG group had a shorter hospital stay (9.4 vs. 12.0 days, P = 0.038) and average incision size was smaller (3.5 vs. 5.4 cm, P = 0.030) than in the B-II LADG group. Anastomotic leakage was not recorded in either group, and there were no differences in the rates of perioperative complications and in inflammatory parameters between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that B-II TLDG is feasible, compared to B-II LADG, and that it has several advantages over LADG, including a smaller incision, a shorter hospital stay, and more convenience during surgery.

We evaluate our algorithm (pfpebwt) on sets of human chromosomes 19, Salmonella, and SARS-CoV2 genomes, and demonstrate that it is the fastest method for all collections, with a maximum speedup of 7.6  on the second best method. The peak memory is at most 2  larger than the second best method. Comparing with methods that are also, as our algorithm, able to report suffix array samples, we obtain a 57.1  improvement in peak memory.

Injectables comprise nearly 80% of all medicines that have experienced shortages during consecutive years. Inadequate capacity resulting from manufacturing quality glitches is a common reason for such shortages. Still, the capacity decisions of competing suppliers, and their impact on the drug supply remains mostly unexplored. To address this issue, we consider two firms selling partially substitutable drugs to a common market. The firms may invest in a combination of reliable and unreliable capacity, where the latter is cheaper but prone to disruption. Each firm's disruption is private information and firms make early and late production decisions that occur before and after learning about the rival's disruptions respectively. We investigate the impact of sharing disruption information on the equilibrium choice of capacities. As expected, the firms benefit from information sharing because it allows them to utilize their excess capacity more efficiently. However, somewhat surprisingly, such information sharing leads to reduced investment in the reliable capacity, which in turn results in lower supply when both firms are disrupted. We propose investment tax credits on capacity additions as a potential mitigation strategy. We find that offering tax credits can not only mitigate the detrimental effect of information sharing but also boost up overall supply. Finally, motivated by the emergence of COVID-19, we investigate the supply chain's resiliency against unforeseen demand surges.","output":"The Strategic Role of Disruption Information Sharing on the Supply of Sterile Injectable Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dysimmune polyneuropathies are the etiologically heterogeneous group of diseases with autoimmune damage to the peripheral nervous system.

An on-going coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a challenge all over the world. Since an endoscopy unit and its staff are at potentially high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we conducted a survey for the management of the gastrointestinal endoscopic practice, personal protective equipment (PPE), and risk assessment for COVID-19 during the pandemic at multiple facilities.Methods. The 11-item survey questionnaire was sent to representative respondent of Department of Gastroenterology, Osaka City University Hospital, and its 19 related facilities.Results. A total of 18 facilities submitted valid responses and a total of 373 health care professionals (HCPs) participated. All facilities (18/18: 100%) were screening patients at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection before endoscopy. During the pandemic, we found that the total volume of endoscopic procedures decreased by 44%. Eleven facilities (11/18: 61%) followed recommendations of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES); consequently, about 35%-50% of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were canceled. Mask (surgical mask or N95 mask), face shield/goggle, gloves (one or two sets), and gown (with long or short sleeves) were being used by endoscopists, nurses, endoscopy technicians, and endoscope cleaning staff in all the facilities (18/18: 100%). SARS-CoV-2 infection risk assessment of HCPs was conducted daily in all the facilities (18/18: 100%), resulting in no subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCPs.Conclusion.

The results indicate that reductions in both WMGHG and aerosol emissions under the Covid\\\\19 green recoveries lead to increases ranging from 0 to 0.3 W m(?2) in global annual mean anthropogenic ERF over the period 2020C2050 relative to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2\\\\4.5 scenario (the baseline case). These positive ERFs are mainly attributed to the rapid and dramatic decreases in atmospheric aerosol content that increase net shortwave radiative flux at the top of atmosphere via weakening the direct aerosol effect and low cloud cover. At the regional scale, reductions in aerosols contribute to positive ERFs throughout the Northern Hemisphere, while the decreased WMGHGs dominate negative ERFs over the areas away from aerosol pollution, such as the Southern Hemisphere oceans. This drives a strong interhemispheric contrast of ERFs. In contrast, the increased anthropogenic emissions under the fossil\\\\fueled recovery scenario lead to an increase of 0.3 W m(?2) in global annual mean ERF in 2050 compared with the baseline case, primarily due to the contribution of WMGHG ERFs.

Since that time, medical services in Saudi Arabia have adapted to the situation by delivering medical care via virtual clinics. Therefore, the aim of the study is to assess physicians' perception and the level of satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a cross-sectional study that included family medicine consultants and fellows who had used telemedicine in primary health care centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was conducted using an online validated questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 219 family medicine consultants and fellows, after obtaining their informed consent. The data that were extracted from the questionnaire included demographics, level of satisfaction, and questions related to their experience with telemedicine. Results Two hundred and nineteen participants enrolled in this study with 50.6% males and 49.4% females. The overall level of physicians satisfaction with telemedicine was 64.3%. However, only one-third preferred telemedicine over office visits. Of these, 60% were males and 40% were females. The only factor that had a statistically significant effect on the preference of office visits or telemedicine was time efficiency (p-value < 0.001). Of those who preferred office visits over telemedicine, 52% of them cited ease of discussion and the ability to make a comprehensive physical examination as the most important reasons for choosing office visits. Technologic issues were the least important factor for choosing either clinic (4.1%). Of those who preferred telemedicine, avoiding contact with patients suspected of COVID-19 was the most commonly cited factor (27.4%). Family medicine physicians face multiple barriers while using telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most commonly cited barrier was the inability to make a full and comprehensive assessment of the patient. Conclusions In the setting of highly transmissible disease epidemics, telemedicine has a lot of potential for providing quick and safe care that is appropriate for screening and management. Based on our findings, using telemedicine should be encouraged by improving physicians skills in this field since telemedicine is a crucial step to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission and provide community-wide treatment.","output":"Physicians Perception Toward Using Telemedicine During COVID-19 Pandemic in King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prolonged maintenance of therapeutically-relevant levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is necessary to enable passive immunization against infectious disease.

Telemedicine was incorporated into clinical workflows and much preventive care, including Hepatitis C (HCV) testing, was not routinely performed. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact that the COVID-19 rapid restructuring response has had on HCV testing and identification hospital-wide and in ambulatory settings. METHODS: BMC utilizes reflex confirmatory testing for HCV. When a sample is HCV Ab positive, it is automatically reflexed for confirmatory RNA and genotype testing. HCV test results for patients were collected daily. We compared unique patient tests for 3.5 month periods before and after March 16th, 2020. Descriptive statistics showed total tests and total new HCV RNA+ before versus after, both hospital-wide and in ambulatory clinics alone. Mean daily tests completed were compared. RESULTS: Hospital-wide, total HCV testing decreased by 49.6%, and new HCV+ patient identification decreased by 42.1%. In ambulatory clinics, testing decreased by 71.9%, and new HCV+ identification decreased by 63.3%. Hospital-wide, mean daily tests decreased by 22.9 tests per day (95% CI: 17.9-28.0, P < .001), and mean daily new HCV+ identification decreased by 0.36 (95% CI: 0.20-0.53, P < .001). In ambulatory clinics, mean daily tests decreased by 22.1 tests per day (95% CI: 17.5-26.7, P < .001) and mean daily HCV+ decreased by 1.40 (95% CI: 1.03-1.76, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 systematic emergency response led to decreased HCV testing and identification, and in this regard telemedicine acts as a barrier to HCV care. Other public health initiatives must be monitored in the context of telemedicine workflows. Continued monitoring of HCV screening trends is vital, and adaptive approaches to work toward the goal of HCV elimination are needed.","output":"Impact of the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic on Ambulatory Hepatitis C Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 53-year-old man admitted to the critical care secondary to respiratory failure due to COVID-19 developed agitation and global hypotonia.

Participants (768 pet dog owners and 767 potential pet dog owners) answered an online survey, including validated depression, anxiety, happiness psychometric scales, attitude to and commitment towards pet, and perceived social support. Potential pet dog owners were defined as individuals who did not own a dog at the time of the survey but would be very or extremely interested in owning one in the future. Dog owners reported having significantly more social support available to them compared to potential dog owners, and their depression scores were also lower, compared to potential dog owners. There were no differences in anxiety and happiness scores between the two groups. Dog owners had a significantly more positive attitude towards and commitment to pets.

Objective: Identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 in patients with allergic diseases and determine if these individuals have a greater risk of presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: It is a cross-sectional, survey-based study designed to assess the degree of symptoms of depression and the risk of PTSD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively in allergic patients. Results: A total of 4,106 surveys were evaluated; 1,656 (40.3%) were patients with allergic disease, and 2,450 (59.7%) were non-allergic (control) individuals. Of those with allergies, 76.6% had respiratory allergic disease including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Individuals with allergic disease reported higher scores regarding symptoms of PTSD on the IES-R scale (p = 0.052, OR 1.24 CI .99 - 1.55) as well as a higher depression risk score in the PHQ-9 questionnaire (mean 6.82 vs. 5.28) p = 0.000 z = -8.76.The allergy group presented a higher score in the IES-R questionnaire (mean 25.42 vs. 20.59), being more susceptible to presenting PTSD (p = 0.000, z = -7.774).The individuals with allergic conditions were further divided into subgroups of those with respiratory allergies such as allergic rhinitis and asthma vs those with non-respiratory allergies such as drug and food allergy, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. This subgroup analysis compares respiratory versus non-respiratory allergic patients, with similar results on the IES-R (mean 25.87 vs 23.9) p = 0.0124, z = -1.539.

By focusing on the early stage, we show that dispersants and biosurfactants, which reduce the interfacial surface tension of oil and water, significantly increase the abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, and the rate of hydrocarbon biodegradation, within 24 h. A succession of obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB), driven by metabolite niche partitioning, is demonstrated. Importantly, this succession has revealed how the OHCB Oleispira, hitherto considered to be a psychrophile, can dominate in the early stages of oil-spill response (1 and 3 days), outcompeting all other OHCB, at the relatively high temperature of 16 C. Additionally, we demonstrate how some dispersants or biosurfactants can select for specific bacterial genera, especially the biosurfactant rhamnolipid, which appears to provide an advantageous compatibility with Pseudomonas, a genus in which some species synthesize rhamnolipid in the presence of hydrocarbons.","output":"Effects of Dispersants and Biosurfactants on Crude-Oil Biodegradation and Bacterial Community Succession"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a huge outbreak worldwide.

To date, there are still no effective strategies to prevent and control PRRSV. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon in which preexisting non-neutralizing antibodies or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitate virus entry and replication, may be a significant obstacle in the development of effective vaccines for many viruses, including PRRSV. However, the contribution of ADE to PRRSV infection remains controversial, especially in vivo. Whether attenuated PRRSV vaccines prevent or worsen subsequent disease in pigs infected by novel PRRSV strains requires more research. In the present study, in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate ADE under different immune statuses, which were produced by waiting different lengths of time after vaccination with a commercially available attenuated highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) vaccine (JXA1-R) before challenging the pigs with a novel heterologous NADC30-like strain. RESULTS: Piglets that were vaccinated before being challenged with PRRSV exhibited lower mortality rates, lower body temperatures, higher bodyweight gain, and lower viremia. These results demonstrate that vaccination with JXA1-R alleviated the clinical signs of PRRSV infection in all vaccinated groups. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data indicate that the attenuated vaccine test here provided partial protection against the NADC30-like strain HNhx. No signs of enhanced PRRSV infection were observed under the applied experimental conditions.

Because of its rareity, the clinical features of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) remain unclear. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old Chinese man with chronic myeloid leukemia received oral treatment with imatinib and initially exhibited a good response. However, he presented with cough and fever 9 months after treatment initiation. DIAGNOSES: Pulmonary computed tomography indicated diffuse interstitial fibrosis in both lungs. All tests for possible infectious pathologies provided negative results. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia and treated with antibiotics; however, there was no improvement. On the basis of a suspicion of imatinib-induced ILD, imatinib was discontinued and prednisone treatment was initiated. OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms ameliorated with treatment, and imatinib was reintroduced. However, he developed cough and dyspnea again, and his treatment was switched to nilotinib as a second-line regimen. He was regularly monitored, and although his clinical symptoms ameliorated, computed tomography performed 29 months after he was diagnosed with ILD showed irreversible pulmonary interstitial fibrosis without progression.

However, the surge of student historical interactions and the lack of prior knowledge is engendering a sequence of issues, such as the decrease in prediction accuracy while the increase in training time. Simultaneously, most existing approaches fail to provide in-depth insights into why a student is likely to answer the question incorrectly and what affects the knowledge state of the student. To address those issues, we propose a multi-head self-attention model named MAKT for dynamic knowledge tracing, which makes the prediction results interpretable at the model and instance level. The customized multi-head self-attention layer has high training efficiency owing to its parallelization capability and spends about 6 seconds in each epoch on a single GPU. We further visualize the attention weights of MAKT and student knowledge acquisition tracking, finding that not all historical interactions are equally important but the recent interactions profoundly establish the knowledge state of students. In the end, extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the robustness and superiorities of MAKT, improving ACC by 1.14 % and AUC by 1.20 % on average. ? 2021 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

The presence of HPT in PLWD (PLWDH) accelerates diabetes-related complications (DRC). Scarce data exist from South Africa on the impact of HPT in PLWD. Methods: Data werecaptured from Edendale Hospital diabetes clinic datasheets from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and analysed to determine differences in demographic, clinical and biochemical variables between PLWD and PLWDH. Results: Data from 822 PLWD were analysed, the majority having HPT (71,386.74%). The prevalence of HPT, resistant HPT (RHPT) and the number of antihypertensives used increased with age and diabetes duration. PLWDH had statistically poorer lipid control (LC), higher creatinine, waist circumference (WC), increased prevalence of sensory peripheral neuropathy, non-proliferative and proliferative retinopathy, cerebrovascular accidents, proteinuria and renal impairment. The significant majority of PLWDH were not meeting diabetes targets (glycaemic, lipid, BMI, WC). The bulk of PLWDH were on combination antihypertensive therapy (p < 0.001) and performed significantly better than monotherapy for glycaemia, LC, BMI and WC. Proteinuria and blood pressure (BP) improved significantly as the number of antihypertensives increased. One-fifth (151, 18.37%) of PLWDH had RHPT;this was more common in females (p < 0.001). PLWD with RHPT had a significantly higher LDL cholesterol, BMI, and urine protein-creatinine ratio (p < 0.001). Over one-quarter (29.87%) of the PLWD without HPT had a BP over 140/90mmHg. Conclusion: It was shown that HPT, RHPT and obesity are significant comorbidities in PLWD and increase the risk of DRC. The majority of PLWDH are not meeting targets, which places them at increased risk of DRC. BP, glycaemic and LC and proteinuria improved in those on combination antihypertensive therapy. A significant proportion of PLWD without HPT had elevated BP, and thus were potentially undiagnosed hypertensives needing intervention.","output":"Hypertension and diabetes mellitus: a collision of two heavyweight non-communicable diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Relatively high concentrations of preexisting particles, acting as a condensation sink (CS) of gaseous precursors, have been thought to suppress the occurrence of new particle formation (NPF) in urban environments, yet NPF still occurs frequently. Here, we aim to understand the factors promoting and inhibiting NPF events in urban Beijing by combining one-year-long measurements of particle number size distributions and PM(2.5) chemical composition. Our results show that indeed the CS is an important factor controlling the occurrence of NPF events, with its chemical composition affecting the efficiency of the background particles in removing gaseous H(2)SO(4) (effectiveness of the CS) driving NPF. During our observation period, the CS was found to be more effective for ammonium nitrate-rich (NH(4)NO(3)-rich) fine particles. On non-NPF event days, particles acting as CS contained a larger fraction of NH(4)NO(3) compared to NPF event days under comparable CS levels. In particular, in the CS range from 0.02 to 0.03 s(C1), the nitrate fraction was 17% on NPF event days and 26% on non-NPF event days.

METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the Palestinian territories, including, Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem, between April 29, 2020, and June 5, 2020, using a validated online questionnaire. The questionnaire included three sections: socio-demographic characteristics, attitude towards the measures and behaviors to avoid COVID-19 infection and its consequences, and level of people satisfaction with the response of the community and local authorities to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. A convenience sampling method was used to select participants. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 26. RESULTS: A total of 570 adults aged 18 years (56.3% males and 43.7% females) were included in the study. The mean positive attitude score (average % agree or strongly agree) was 94.22%; 95.24%, 95.18%, and 92.18% in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem, respectively.

This new member of the coronavirus family has created a potentially fatal disease, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Despite the continuous efforts of researchers to find effective vaccines and drugs for COVID-19, there is still no success in this matter. AREAS COVERED: Here, the literature regarding the COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in the clinical trials, as well as main candidates in pre-clinical stages for development and research, were reviewed. These candidates have been developed under five different major platforms, including live-attenuated vaccine, mRNA-based vaccine, DNA vaccines, inactivated virus, and viral-vector-based vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: There are several limitations in the field of the rapid vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2, and other members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The key challenges of designing an effective vaccine within a short time include finding the virulence ability of an emerging virus and potential antigen, choosing suitable experimental models and efficient route of administration, the immune-response study, designing the clinical trials, and determining the safety, as well as efficacy.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine: where are we now and where should we go?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Up to 47% of pregnant women with COVID-19 have preterm deliveries. A severe, symptomatic COVID-19 infection in close-to-term pregnancies can have a poor prognosis. Early identification of COVID-19 in pregnant women can prevent the progression of the disease. Currently, there is very little guidance on treating pregnant close-to-term women with COVID-19; this case report suggests changes to current management to maximize positive maternal and fetal outcomes. CASE REPORT A pregnant woman (37 weeks of gestation) presented to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of fever with an associated cough for 2 days. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Emergency Department, and discharged in a stable condition. She returned 5 days later in preterm labor with severe respiratory distress. After an emergency cesarean section, she remained intubated in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit; she was persistently hypotensive and hypoxic despite maximal ventilator and medical treatment. She died after a cardiac arrest and unsuccessful resuscitation, 15 days after the delivery. We discuss the possible benefit of a planned C-section for close-to-term pregnancies prior to the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The patient's next of kin gave informed consent for this case report. Approval from the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Review Board was not required as this is a case report. CONCLUSIONS Currently, asymptomatic pregnant women are not tested for COVID-19 infection until hospitalization for delivery.

RESULTS In the community sample, the lifetime prevalence of adult homelessness was 10.2%, with the highest prevalence found in participants aged 30-44 years (19.9% prevalence). In the Veterans Affairs administrative data, 4.2% of all Veterans Affairs service users used homeless services (n=290,515 Veterans Affairs homeless services); 27.9% of these were first-time Veterans Affairs homeless service users. Veterans who were racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to report any lifetime adult homelessness, more likely to be identified as homeless in Veterans Affairs records, and more likely to have used any Veterans Affairs homeless program. There was no sex difference in the lifetime prevalence of homelessness, but Veterans Affairs records showed that male veterans were more likely to be identified as homeless and to use homeless programs, suggesting possible underidentification of female veteran homelessness. Across age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups, 35.1% of Veterans Affairs homeless service users used emergency department services in the same year.

A high-throughput phenotyping platform (HTPP) generates the data of the complete life cycle of a plant. However, the data are rarely used for yield prediction because of the lack of quality image analysis methods, yield data associated with HTPP, and the time-series analysis method for yield prediction. To overcome limitations, this study employed multiple deep learning (DL) networks to extract high-quality HTTP data, establish an association between HTTP data and the yield performance of crops, and select essential time intervals using machine learning (ML). The images of Arabidopsis were taken 12 times under environmentally controlled HTPP over 23 days after sowing (DAS). First, the features from images were extracted using DL network U-Net with SE-ResXt101 encoder and divided into early (15C21 DAS) and late (21C23 DAS) pre-flowering developmental stages using the physiological characteristics of the Arabidopsis plant. Second, the late pre-flowering stage at 23 DAS can be predicted using the ML algorithm XGBoost, based only on a portion of the early pre-flowering stage (17C21 DAS). This was confirmed using an additional biological experiment (P < 0.01). Finally, the projected area (PA) was estimated into fresh weight (FW), and the correlation coefficient between FW and predicted FW was calculated as 0.85. This was the first study that analyzed time-series data to predict the FW of related but different developmental stages and predict the PA. The results of this study were informative and enabled the understanding of the FW of Arabidopsis or yield of leafy plants and total biomass consumed in vertical farming. Moreover, this study highlighted the reduction of time-series data for examining interesting traits and future application of time-series analysis in various HTPPs.","output":"Time-Series Growth Prediction Model Based on U-Net and Machine Learning in Arabidopsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral and paraviral exanthems are the most common exanthems in children and are often the reason for a medical evaluation, especially in pediatric primary care and emergency rooms.

However, progress in oligonucleotide-based therapeutics has been limited by the difficulty in delivering these complex molecules to their sites of action in the cytosol or nucleus of cells within specific tissues. There are two aspects to the delivery problem. The first is that most types of oligonucleotides have poor uptake into non-hepatic tissues. The second is that much of the oligonucleotide that is taken up by cells is entrapped in endosomes where it is pharmacologically inert. It has become increasingly recognized that endosomal trapping is a key constraint on oligonucleotide therapeutics. Thus, many approaches have been devised to address this problem, primarily ones based on various nanoparticle technologies. However, recently an alternative approach has emerged that employs small molecules to manipulate intracellular trafficking processes so as to enhance oligonucleotide actions. This review presents the current status of this chemical biology approach to oligonucleotide delivery and seeks to point out possible paths for future development.","output":"Chemical Manipulation of the Endosome Trafficking Machinery: Implications for Oligonucleotide Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Large discrepancies exist between standards of healthcare provision in high-income (HICs) and low and middle-income countries (LMICs). The root cause is often financial, resulting in poor infrastructure and under-resourced education and healthcare systems. Continuing professional education (CPE) programmes improve staff knowledge, skills, retention, and practice, but remain costly and rare in low-resource settings. One potential solution involves healthcare education collaborations between institutions in HICs and LMICs to provide culturally appropriate CPE in LMICs. To be effective, educational partnerships must address the challenges arising from differences in cultural norms, language, available technology and organisational structures within collaborating countries. METHODS Seven databases and other sources were systematically searched on 7 July 2020 for relevant studies. Citations, abstracts, and studies were screened and consensus was reached on which to include within the review. 54 studies were assessed regarding the type of educational programme involved, the nature of HIC/LMIC collaboration and quality of the study design. RESULTS Studies varied greatly regarding the types and numbers of healthcare professionals involved, pedagogical and delivery methods, and the ways in which collaboration was undertaken. Barriers and enablers of collaboration were identified and discussed. The key findings were: 1. The methodological quality of reporting in the studies was generally poor. 2. The way in which HIC/LMIC healthcare education collaboration is undertaken varies according to many factors, including what is to be delivered, the learner group, the context, and the resources available. 3. Western bias was a major barrier. 4. The key to developing successful collaborations was the quality, nature, and duration of the relationships between those involved. CONCLUSION This review provides insights into factors that underpin successful HIC/LMIC healthcare CPE collaborations and outlines inequities and quality issues in reporting.","output":"Collaborative healthcare education programmes for continuing professional education in low and middle-income countries: A Best Evidence Medical Education (BEME) systematic review.

Conscientious objection policy confusion and variability can arise as it may occasionally be unclear what underpins non-participation. Our objective was to identify, analyze, and synthesize the factors that influenced HCPs who did not participate in ethically complex, legally available healthcare. METHODS We used Arksey and O'Malley's framework while considering Levac et al.'s enhancements, and qualitatively synthesized the evidence. We searched Medline, CINAHL, JSTOR, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global from January 1, 1998, to January 15, 2020, and reviewed the references of the final articles. We included articles written in English that discussed the factors that influenced physicians and registered nurses (RNs) who did not participate in end-of-life (EOL), reproductive technology and health, genetic testing, and organ or tissue donation healthcare areas. Using Covidence, we conducted title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening against our eligibility criteria. We extracted the article's data into a spreadsheet, analyzed the articles, and completed a qualitative content analysis using NVivo12. RESULTS We identified 10,664 articles through the search, and after the screening, 16 articles were included. The articles sampled RNs (n = 5) and physicians (n = 11) and encompassed qualitative (n = 7), quantitative (n = 7), and mixed (n = 2) methodologies. The care areas included reproductive technology and health (n = 11), EOL (n = 3), organ procurement (n = 1), and genetic testing (n = 1).

Sovereignty conflicts are increasingly occurring within member states. This paper develops a conceptual framework that distinguishes between foundational, institutional and territorial conflicts of sovereignty, elaborating on this taxonomy with reference to the historical evolution of the concept of sovereignty in Europe. It provides an account of why we have seen a proliferation in conflicts of sovereignty within European states. This is due in part to the notion of shared sovereignty. Central to European integration, this notion has introduced considerable institutional indeterminacy into the political systems of member states, leading to many of the institutional conflicts of sovereignty we see in Europe today. The struggle of national party systems to institutionalize societal conflict via partisan competition is another contributory factor. This has displaced conflict onto the terrain of how popular rule is institutionalized within the national state. In developing this framework, the paper provides a method for distinguishing between political conflicts tout court and those touching specifically upon sovereignty. Moreover, the framework helps us distinguish between those conflicts of sovereignty most destabilizing for a polity and those which are less so.","output":"Conflicts of sovereignty in contemporary Europe: a framework of analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) have reduced fertility, but the underlying regulation of ovarian function remains unknown. Although differential microRNA (miRNA) expression has been described in several ovarian disorders, little is known about the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of DOR. In this study, we investigated the expression levels of miR-484 in granulosa cells (GCs) derived from human follicular fluid, and explored their correlation with female ovarian reserve function as well as clinical outcomes of assisted reproduction technology (ART). Additionally, we investigated the effects of miR-484 on the biological functions of GC cell lines in vitro. We found that miR-484 was highly expressed in GCs from DOR patients and was correlated with decreasing AMH levels and AFC, as well as increasing FSH levels, but not with LH, progesterone, or estradiol. Additionally, miR-484 was negatively related to the number of retrieved oocytes and the ratio of high-quality embryos. Moreover, we found that miR-484 repressed the proliferation of GCs and induced apoptosis, which can in part be attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, silencing miR-484 had the opposite effect. Multiple approaches, including bioinformatic analysis, RNA-seq, qPCR, immunofluorescence, western blotting and luciferase reporter assays, identified YAP1 as a direct target of miR-484 in GCs. Additionally, reintroduction of YAP1 rescued the effects of miR-484 in GCs. The present study indicates that miR-484 can directly target the mRNA of YAP1, induce mitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently reduce the viability and promote the apoptosis of granulosa cells, which contributes to the pathogenesis of DOR.","output":"Mir-484 contributes to diminished ovarian reserve by regulating granulosa cell function via YAP1-mediated mitochondrial function and apoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In nursing education, virtual reality simulation (VRS) is recognized as an effective learning method as it overcomes limitations in practical training and positively influences learning ability and satisfaction levels.

The results revealed significantly higher knowledge (U = 156.5, p = 0.024) and clinical performance competency (U = 87.5, p = 0.002) with the procedure of using a training system of VRS for IV injection compared to having training via an IV arm simulator. This study verified that VRS for IV injection was more effective than an IV arm simulator for practical training on IV injection. Thus, VRS for IV injection, an effective teaching method used to improve learning ability and satisfaction levels, can be used as a training method in the future.","output":"Implementation and Evaluation of a Virtual Reality Simulation: Intravenous Injection Training System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly susceptible from respiratory exacerbations from viral respiratory tract infections. However, it is unclear whether they are at increased risk of COVID-19 pneumonia or COVID-19-related mortality. We aimed to determine whether COPD is a risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, severe COVID-19, or death. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 clinical studies published between November 1(st), 2019 and January 28(th), 2021 (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020191491). We included studies that quantified the number of COPD patients, and reported at least one of the following outcomes stratified by COPD status: hospitalization; severe COVID-19; ICU admission; mechanical ventilation; acute respiratory distress syndrome; or mortality. We meta-analyzed the results of individual studies to determine the odds ratio (OR) of these outcomes in patients with COPD compared to those without COPD. FINDINGS: Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria, and underwent data extraction. Most studies were retrospective cohort studies/case series of hospitalized patients. Only four studies examined the effects of COPD on COVID-19 outcomes as their primary endpoint. In aggregate, COPD was associated with increased odds of hospitalization (OR 4.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.65C4.90), ICU admission (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02C1.78), and mortality (OR 2.47, 95% CI 2.18C2.79). INTERPRETATION: Having a clinical diagnosis of COPD significantly increases the odds of poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. COPD patients should thus be considered a high-risk group, and targeted for preventative measures and aggressive treatment for COVID-19 including vaccination.","output":"COPD and the risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: For patients with non-epidermal nonCsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), molecular alterations should always be investigated, especially in non-smokers, who have a very high frequency of targetable alterations (EGFR 52%; ALK 8% in particular). MET exon 14 alterations are identified in 3C4% of NSCLCs and MET gene amplification and high protein expression are associated with a poor prognosis. The French recommendations only authorize the use of capmatinib and crizotinib if the mutation concerns exon 14. However, several different types of mutation in exon 14 of MET and its flanking introns can induce a jump in exon 14, activate the MET gene and thus be sensitive to anti-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CASE SUMMARY: This case concerns a 76-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension, obesity (BMI 36kg/m2), and a 5C10 pack-per-year smoking history. A left upper lobe pulmonary nodule of 12.4 mm was discovered in March 2019. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC 5 and vinorelbine 25.00 mg/m2. At the end of the adjuvant treatment, the patient was in complete remission for 5 months. In February 2020, the CT scan revealed a mediastinal lymph node progression. A complementary molecular analysis was realized on the initial surgical specimen. A c.3082+3A>T mutation in the MET gene was identified. This mutation confers susceptibility to anti-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treatment with crizotinib was initiated with an initial dose of 250 mg/day for 15 days and then increased to 250 mg twice a day. After 7 months of treatment with crizotinib, the disease was still stable according to RECIST 1.1.

AIM To investigate the timing of end-of-life recognition, palliative registration, and the recording of end-of-life preferences in primary care for people aged 75 years. DESIGN AND SETTING Retrospective cohort study using national primary care record data, covering 34% of GP practices in England. METHOD ResearchOne data from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) of people aged 75 years who died in England between 1 January 2015 and 1 January 2016 were examined. Clinical codes relating to end-of-life recognition, palliative registration, and end-of-life preferences were extracted, and the number of months that elapsed between the code being entered and death taking place were calculated. The timing for each outcome and proportion of relevant EHRs were reported. RESULTS Death was recorded for a total of 13 149 people in ResearchOne data during the 1-year study window. Of those, 6303 (47.9%) records contained codes suggesting end of life had been recognised at a point in time prior to the month of death. Recognition occurred 12 months before death in 2248 (17.1%) records. In total, 1659 (12.6%) people were on the palliative care register and 457 (3.5%) were on the register for 12 months before death; 2987 (22.7%) records had a code for the patient's preferred place of care, and 1713 (13.0%) had a code for the preferred place of death. Where preferences for place of death were recorded, a care, nursing, or residential home (n = 813, 47.5%) and the individual's home (n = 752, 43.9%) were the most common. CONCLUSION End-of-life recognition in primary care appears to occur near to death and for only a minority of people aged 75 years. The findings suggest that older people's deaths may not be anticipated by health professionals, compromising equitable access to palliative care.","output":"Timing of GP end-of-life recognition in people aged 75 years: retrospective cohort study using data from primary healthcare records in England."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the COVID-19 disease pandemic since December 2019 highlights the importance of developing efficient antiviral strategies to prevent and treat viral infection Virus particles are nanosized, therefore design strategies are suitable to develop advanced nano and quantum materials that can interact with and mimic virus particles Quantum science and nanoscience can help in the synthesis and functionalization of nanomaterials for virus prevention, treatment, and detection The first step is identifying the genome sequencing of the virus, then the fabrication of antiviral (virustatic or virucidal) materials Quantum and nanoscience-enabled nanomaterials yield better performance and flexibility for virus detection, vaccine design and delivery, facemasks, respirators, and drugs In this review, we explore the applications of quantum and nanoscience in diagnosis, inhibition, and antiviral therapy Further, we explain how the van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, fluctuation of the medium, electrodynamic and thermal fluctuations, local field enhancement effect, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation can prevent the viral life cycle through the virustatic and virucidal effects of quantum and nanoparticles","output":"Essential role of quantum science and nanoscience in antiviral strategies for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an extraordinary challenge to the world.

The contribution of our study is towards determining the predictors of severity and the outcome of liver injury among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with a preexisting liver disease and COVID-19. METHODS This single center retrospective cohort study included all patients 18 years, admitted in Sheba Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained using the MDClone platform and rechecked after data decryption using electronic health records. RESULTS Of 382 patients with COVID-19, 66.4% had increased liver biochemistry. Mild increase was observed in 76.7%. The higher level of fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) at admission was independently associated with higher mortality rate. Preexisting liver disease was detected in 15.4% patients. Most common etiology was nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (78.7%). The mortality of hospitalized patients with preexisting liver disease was 16.7% compared to 6.8% in patients without preexisting liver disease (RR = 2.792, P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, liver disease adjusted to age and BMI was associated with mortality with high statistical significance.

METHODS: Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. RESULTS: In total, 21% (n = 10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the overall mortality rate was 13% (n = 6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p < 0.001) upon admission than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p = 2.6  10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p = 0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements; whereas, the concentrations in survivors were stable. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p = 0.02).

It can generally be identified in the pre-school years and can impact on children's educational outcomes, which in turn may affect outcomes across the life span. High income countries increasingly assess children for developmental delay in the early years, as part of universal child health programmes, however there is little evidence as to which measures best predict later educational outcomes. This systematic review aims to assess results from the current literature on which measures hold the best predictive value, in order to inform the developmental surveillance aspects of universal child health programmes. METHODS Systematic review sources: Medline (2000 -current), Embase (2000 -current), PsycInfo (2000 -current) and ERIC (2000 -current). Additional searching of birth cohort studies was undertaken and experts consulted. Eligibility criteria: Included studies were in English from peer reviewed papers or books looking at developmental assessment of preschool children as part of universal child health surveillance programmes or birth cohort studies, with linked results of later educational success/difficulties. The study populations were limited to general populations of children aged 0-5 years in high income countries. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out by two independent authors and any disagreement discussed. PROSPERO registration number CRD42018103111. RESULTS Thirteen studies were identified for inclusion in the review. The studies were highly heterogeneous: age of children at first assessment ranged from 1-5 years, and at follow-up from 4-26 years. Type of initial and follow-up assessment also varied. Results indicated that, with the exception of one study, the most highly predictive initial assessments comprised combined measures of children's developmental progress, such as a screening tool alongside teacher ratings and developmental histories. Other stand-alone measures also performed adequately, the best of these being the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Latency between measures, age of child at initial measurement, size of studies and quality of studies all impacted on the strength of results. CONCLUSIONS This review was the first to systematically assess the predictive value of preschool developmental assessment at a population level on later educational outcomes. Results demonstrated consistent associations between relatively poor early child development and later educational difficulties. In general, specificity and Negative Predictive Value are high, suggesting that young children who perform well in developmental assessment are unlikely to go on to develop educational difficulties, however the sensitivity and Positive Predictive Values were generally low, indicating that these assessments would not meet the requirements for a screening test. For surveillance purposes, however, findings suggested that combined measures provided the best results, although these are resource intensive and thus difficult to implement in universal child health programmes. Health service providers may therefore wish to consider using stand-alone measures, which also were shown to provide adequate predictive value, such as the ASQ.","output":"The predictive value of universal preschool developmental assessment in identifying children with later educational difficulties: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are an emerging class of drugs that target RNAs.

Our method makes sure that ASO binding is compatible with target structures in three-dimensional (3D) space by employing structural design templates. These 3D-ASOs recognize the shapes and hydrogen bonding patterns of targets via tertiary interactions, achieving enhanced affinity and specificity.

Oxerutin is a member of the flavonoid family and possesses antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oxerutin has protective effects on RIRI. METHODS Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham control group (n=8), RIRI group (n=10), and RIRI + oxerutin group (n=10). RIRI was achieved by clamping the left renal artery for 30 min, followed 1-h reperfusion period. Thereafter, blood samples and left kidney tissue samples were taken for histopathological and biochemical examination. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urea, creatinine, and cystatin C levels, which are indicators of kidney function, as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which is an indicator of inflammation were analyzed in blood samples. Total antioxidant status and total oxidant status (TOS), which are indicators of oxidative stress were analyzed on renal tissues. The apoptotic index, an indicator of kidney damage, as well as histopathological changes were evaluated on renal tissues. RESULTS The apoptotic index, TOS, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, BUN, and urea levels were lower in the RIRI + oxerutin group than in the RIRI group (p<0.05). The results demonstrated that the histopathological and biochemical properties of oxerutin protected rats from RIRI. CONCLUSION The findings obtained in this study show that prophylactic administration of oxerutin has protective effects on apoptosis and renal failure caused by RIRI. Therefore, oxerutin can be used as an effective prophylactic agent in the treatment of RIRI.","output":"The efficiency of oxerutin on apoptosis and kidney function in rats with renal ischemia reperfusion injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spain was one of the epicenters of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic We describe in this article the design and results of a new telephone-and-telematic multiplatform model of systematic prenatal and postpartum follow-up for COVID-19-affected women implemented in a tertiary reference hospital in Madrid We included patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 during pregnancy or delivery from 10 March 2020 to 15 December 2020 We had a total of 211 obstetric patients: 148 (70 1%) were tested at the onset of suspicious clinical manifestations and 62 (29 4%) were tested in the context of routine screening Of all the patients, 60 women (28 4%) were asymptomatic and 97 (46%) presented mild symptoms Fifty-one women (24 2%) were admitted to our hospital for specific treatment because of moderate or severe symptoms We had no missed cases and a good adherence The mean number of calls per patient was 2 3 We performed 55 in-person visits We analyzed the complexity of our program over time, showing a two-wave-like pattern One patient was identified as needing hospitalization and we did not record major morbidity Telemedicine programs are a strong and reproducible tool to reach to pregnant population affected by COVID-19, to assess its symptoms and severity, and to record for pregnancy-related symptoms both in an outpatient regime and after discharge from hospital","output":"A New Multiplatform Model for Outpatient Prenatal and Postpartum Care in a Cohort of COVID-19-Affected Obstetric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemics may have social scarring effects, increasing the likelihood of social unrest.

To tackle the issue, we assessed the levels and explored determinants of engagement towards the COVID-19 vaccine among the Algerian population. MethodsA nationwide, online-based cross-sectional study was conducted between March 27 and April 30, 2021. A two-stage stratified snowball sampling method was used to include an equivalent number of participants from the four cardinal regions of the country. A vaccine engagement scale was developed, defining vaccine engagement as a multidimensional parameter (5 items) that combined self-stated acceptance and willingness with perceived safety and efficacy of the vaccine. An Engagement score was calculated and the median was used to define engagement versus nonengagement. Sociodemographic and clinical data, perceptions about COVID-19 and levels of adherence to preventive measures were analyzed as predictors for nonengagement. ResultsWe included 1,019 participants, 54% were female and 64% were aged 18-29 years. Overall, there were low rates of self-declared acceptance (26%) and willingness (21%) to take the vaccine, as well as low levels of agreement regarding vaccine safety (21%) and efficacy (30%). Thus, vaccine engagement rate was estimated at 33.5%, and ranged between 29.6-38.5% depending on the region (p>0.05). Nonengagement was independently associated with female gender (OR=2.31, p<0.001), low adherence level to preventive measures (OR=6.93p<0.001), private sector jobs (OR=0.53, p=0.038), perceived COVID-19 severity (OR=0.66, p=0.014), and fear from contracting the disease (OR=0.56, p=0.018). Concern about vaccine side effects (72.0%) and exigence for more efficacy and safety studies (48.3%) were the most commonly reported barrier and enabler for vaccine acceptance respectively; whereas beliefs in the conspiracy theory were reported by 23.4%. ConclusionsThe very low rates of vaccine engagement among the Algerian population probably explain the slow ascension of the vaccination curve in the country. Vaccine awareness campaigns should be implemented to address the multiple misconceptions and enhance the levels of knowledge and perception both about the disease and the vaccine, by prioritizing target populations and engaging both healthcare workers and the general population.","output":"Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Engagement in Algeria: A Population-based Study with Systematic Review of Studies from Arab Countries of the MENA Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Histological remission is evolving as an important treatment target in UC. We aimed to develop a simple histological index, aligned to endoscopy, correlated with clinical outcomes, and suited to apply to an artificial intelligence (AI) system to evaluate inflammatory activity. METHODS: Using a set of 614 biopsies from 307 patients with UC enrolled into a prospective multicentre study, we developed the Paddington International virtual ChromoendoScopy ScOre (PICaSSO) Histologic Remission Index (PHRI). Agreement with multiple other histological indices and validation for inter-reader reproducibility were assessed. Finally, to implement PHRI into a computer-aided diagnosis system, we trained and tested a novel deep learning strategy based on a CNN architecture to detect neutrophils, calculate PHRI and identify active from quiescent UC using a subset of 138 biopsies. RESULTS: PHRI is strongly correlated with endoscopic scores (Mayo Endoscopic Score and UC Endoscopic Index of Severity and PICaSSO) and with clinical outcomes (hospitalisation, colectomy and initiation or changes in medical therapy due to UC flare-up). A PHRI score of 1 could accurately stratify patients' risk of adverse outcomes (hospitalisation, colectomy and treatment optimisation due to flare-up) within 12 months. Our inter-reader agreement was high (intraclass correlation 0.84). Our preliminary AI algorithm differentiated active from quiescent UC with 78% sensitivity, 91.7% specificity and 86% accuracy.

Originally higher SARS-CoV-2 rates in the most socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods changed to being higher in the least deprived neighbourhoods from the 1st September 2021. While the introduction of Omicron initially reset inequalities, they continued to be dynamic and inconsistent. Individuals who were fully vaccinated (two doses) were associated with fewer registered positive tests (e.g., between 1st September and 27th November 2021: (i) individuals engaged in testing - Hazards Ratio (HR) = 0.48, 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) = 0.47-0.50; (ii) individuals engaged with healthcare - HR = 0.34, 95% CIs = 0.33-0.34). Individuals with a previous registered positive test were also less likely to have a registered positive test (e.g., between 1st September and 27th November 2021: (i) individuals engaged in testing - HR = 0.16, 95% CIs = 0.15-0.18; (ii) individuals engaged with healthcare - HR = 0.14, 95% CIs = 0.13-0.16).

A structured interview queried COVID-19-associated physical symptoms, and mental health screens were performed with the generalized anxiety disorder-2 (GAD-2) and patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Prior medical and neuropsychiatric data were obtained from preceding study visits. Post hoc analyses were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 62.1 years, 39% were women, and 35% African American, 37% Latinx, and 28% Caucasian.

The COVID-19 pandemic severely curtailed face-to-face contact between households, particularly for older adults (aged 60 and above), due to their high risk of developing severe illness if infected by COVID-19. In-person contact, where possible, was largely replaced by virtual interaction during the pandemic. This article examines how inter-household contact in face-to-face and virtual forms, as well as combinations of the two forms of contact, related to older adults mental well-being during the pandemic. Data from two national longitudinal surveys, collected from the same respondents before (2018C2019) and during (June 2020) the pandemic, were comparatively analysed: the Health and Retirement Study in the US and Understanding Society in the UK. The findings showed a notable increase in loneliness in the US and a decline in general mental well-being in the UK following the outbreak of COVID-19. In both countries, more frequent inter-household face-to-face contact during the pandemic was associated with better general mental well-being, but inter-household virtual contact, via means such as telephone and digital media, was not associated with general mental well-being in either the US or the UK. In the US, older adults who engaged more frequently in virtual contact were more likely to feel lonely during the pandemic, particularly if their face-to-face contact was limited. In both countries, the increase in loneliness following the outbreak of the pandemic was greater for older adults who reported more virtual contact.

It is noteworthy that digestive symptoms are frequently observed in COVID-19 patients. We sought to describe the immune-inflammatory characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity. Methods: : We designated enrolled mild patients into three subtypes depending on the patients with or without digestive symptoms, including Digestive only (digestive symptoms only), Respiratory only (respiratory symptoms only) and Digestive+ Respiratory (Both digestive and respiratory symptoms). Patient discharge was based on negative results of rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two sequential respiratory tract specimens collected 24 hours apart. The multiorgan function, immune-inflammatory characteristics were analyzed among three groups. Results: : Mild liver damage and the activation of immuno-inflammatory system are the most abnormalities in mild patients but no significant differences were found (p0.05). Compared with the Respiratory only group, patients with digestive symptoms were more likely to have slightly higher and later peak values of inflammatory cytokines during the subsequent course of disease(P0.05). Additionally, we also found that there was a significant correlation between IL-2 and TNF level in the Digestive only cases (P0.05). Conclusions: : Mild patients only/accompanied with digestive symptoms are a special subtype of COVID-19. Patients in this group were more likely to have slightly higher and later peak values of inflammatory cytokines during the subsequent course of disease.

This almost instantaneous mass shift to teaching online has made transparent great disparities in how digital competences -- particularly those of teachers -- were conceptualized, taught and assessed within various educational programs. We present a comparative analysis of the approaches to teachers' learning and professional development that state and non-state actors in four Central and East European countries have articulated in the first months of COVID-19 related lockdown. We take a Critical Frame Analysis approach to exploring the roles played by state and non-state actors in the four countries in conceptually framing the relationship between the digital competences required in emergency remote teaching and teachers' learning and professional development at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. It is suggested that the educational policy debate at the beginning of the crisis rendered visible: (a) that this massive sudden shift required understanding digitalization as a complex multifaceted process requiring levels of digital and pedagogical competence teachers were unlikely to have previously developed;(b) that addressing these issues through short-term interventions would only exacerbate the risk of ignoring arising equity issues;(c) that situating emergency measures in the context of potential medium and long-term developments could open opportunities to explore mainstreaming the digitalization of education and promoting blended learning, as well as offer a better perspective on issues of digital poverty and the inequitable impact of not addressing it adequately will have in the future.","output":"Teachers' Digital Competences in the First Educational Policy Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis in Four Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to develop and implement an emergency coping education program using a case-based small-group learning method and verify its effect on care workers emergency coping abilities.

This research aims to analyse the planning and health workforce policies in Germany, a country with a largely decentralised workforce governance mechanism. METHODS: Systematic search between 18 and 31 May 2020 at federal and 16 states on health workforce action and planning (websites of ministries of health, public health authorities), including pandemic preparedness plans and policies. The search followed World Health Organisation (WHO) Europe's health workforce guidance on Covid-19. Content analysis was performed, informed by the themes of WHO. RESULTS: The pandemic preparedness plans consisted of no or limited information on how to expand and prepare the health workforce during pandemics. The 16 states varied considerably regarding implementing strategies to expand health workforce capacities. Only one state adopted a policy on task-shifting despite a federal law on task-shifting during pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: Planning on the health workforce, its capacity and skill-mix during pandemics was limited in the pandemic response plans. Actions during the peak of the pandemic varied considerably across states, were implemented ad hoc and with limited planning. Future action should focus on integrated planning and evaluation of workforce policies.","output":"Health workforce response to Covid-19: What pandemic preparedness planning and action at the federal and state levels in Germany?: Germany's health workforce responses to Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The health care workers (HCWs) in medical sectors are among the vital assets of any country during the emergence of crises such as pandemic prevalence caused by COVID-19. Therefore, maintaining the health of this group of staffs is necessary not only to save lives of patients, but also to control prevalence of diseases. People at the frontline of fighting COVID-19 are at higher risk for mental health problems, including stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The main objective of this study is to study the status of job stress in the three occupational groups of nurses, physicians and hospital cleaning crew facing corona patients in Iran hospitals. Methods: : This cross-sectional descriptive analytical study is performed on 290 medical staff (nurses, physicians and cleaning crew) facing COVID-19 patients working in different hospitals in Iran in 2020. Demographic information form and Job Stress Questionnaire (HSE tool indicator) were used to collect data. The HSE questionnaire has 35 questions and 7 areas, which was developed in the 1990s by the UK Health and Safety Institute to measure job stress. Results: : 59% of the participants in this study were male. 62% of participants in this study were married. Participants often had work experience between 3 to 10 years. 66% of the participants were in the age range of 20 to 30 years. Percent of participants shift work satisfaction was 67%.

Conclusions: : The prevalence of COVID-19 has a great impact on the level of job stress in the HCWs of Iranian hospitals. Factors such as high workload, low response time at the peak of hospital visits, lack of adequate support for top managers of all job groups equally, lack of access to adequate personal protective equipment, unpreparedness of managers and staff to respond to the critical and emergency conditions on stress incidence were effective on the present study.","output":"Occupational Stress Assessment of Health Care Workers (HCWs) Facing COVID\\\\19 Patients in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, the heterogenous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case fatality rate (CFR) could be influenced by various epidemiological parameters. Identifying these could help formulate effective public health strategies. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 for each of the 220 countries as on July 30, 2020 were evaluated against key epidemiological variables, namely - BCG vaccination (ongoing vs. discontinued/never undertaken), %population aged [a?]65 years, incidences of ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), cancer, malaria, and diabetes; human development index (HDI) and population density. These were retrieved from the public domains of WHO, UN, World Bank and published reports. The COVID-19 CFRs ranged between 0.0% and 28.3% (mean {+/-} SD: 3.05% {+/-} 3.48). The influence of the individual epidemiological parameters on CFR were evaluated through the event rate estimations. A significantly lower event rate was observed in countries with ongoing BCG vaccination program (ER: with vs without ongoing BCG vaccination: 0.020 vs 0.034, p<0.001). The type of BCG strains used also influenced the ER; this being 0.018, 0.031 and 0.019 for early, late and mixed strains respectively (p=0.008). The epidemiological variables significantly associated with higher COVID-19 event rate were countries with higher %population aged [a?]65 years (p<0.001), greater incidence of IHD (p<0.001) and cancer (p=0.003) and better HDI (p=0.003). Incidences of malaria, HHD and diabetes along with population density had no significant impact on COVID-19 CFR. Further, BCG vaccination significantly lowered the COVID-19 ER in each of the high-risk population subgroups - countries with >7.1% population aged [a?]65 years (p=0.008), >0.737 HDI (p=0.001), IHD >1171/105 population (p=0.004) and cancer incidence >15726 (p<0.001). The results supports BCG induced trained immunity leading to heterologous immunoprotection against COVID-19. Thus BCG vaccination with early strains could provide a cost-effective prophylaxis, especially in high-risk individuals and bridge the gap till an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is freely available globally.","output":"Comprehensive analysis of the key epidemiological parameters to evaluate the impact of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this pediatric perspectives article, we discuss current limits in the understanding of novel coronavirus infection.

This study assesses the incidence and degree of chronic pain and discomfort after primary inguinal hernia repair performed in our hospital and aims to clarify its relationship to the type of mesh placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of 334 patients (378 lesions) who underwent primary inguinal hernia using the Lichtenstein (onlay mesh), Ultrapro Plug (UPP; onlay plus plug mesh), modified Kugel Patch (onlay and underlay mesh), or laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP; underlay mesh) procedure. Postoperative pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale at postoperative 2-3 wk, 3 mo, and 6 mo. Postoperative discomfort was assessed 6 mo afterward. RESULTS Questionnaire responses were received for 378 lesions (100%) after 2-3 wk, 229 (60.6%) after 3 mo, and 249 (65.9%) after 6 mo. The majority of chronic pain experienced was mild, and no patient suffered from severe pain. The level of pain tended to be less for the TAPP procedure than for other methods. Discomfort at rest was significantly less for TAPP versus Ultrapro Plug (P < 0.01), and discomfort with movement was significantly less for TAPP versus modified Kugel (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Onlay mesh appears to be a risk factor in chronic pain and discomfort. The lower level of chronic pain and discomfort with underlay mesh placement is considered to result from the reduced risk of nerve damage in this procedure than in the onlay mesh placement procedure.","output":"Assessment of the incidence of chronic pain and discomfort after primary inguinal hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The crisis related to the COVID 19 pandemic caused an increase in nickel prices on the global markets. From this perspective, it seems promising to search for the possibilities of effective recycling of nickel-based alloys as biomaterials. The topic of the recasting of Ni-Cr dental alloys is currently being broadly described in the literature. Nonetheless, there are still no conclusive results on the impact of recasting on the quality of the cast dentures. Considering the aforementioned, for research, the effect of recasting on the wear resistance and microstructure of NiCrMo dental alloy was investigated. The Heraenium NA alloy was used for testing. Abrasion resistance was tested by the ball on disc method. Microstructure and wear trace were observed using an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The tests showed a higher wear resistance of the re-casted material. The average coefficient of friction for the initially cast alloys was 0.664, while for the remelted samples the mean value was 0.441. The tested samples are characterised by an abrasive-adhesive wear mechanism. Piling up of the wear tracks edges was observed - the highest for H100. For the H100 samples, a slightly lower average hardness value (HV10) was observed - 226 compared to 233 (HV10) for the samples made from the re-casted alloy (H0). The presence of a dendritic structure of alloys was demonstrated. Blocky eutectic precipitations are visible against the matrix. The observed growth of interdendritic precipitations constitute a natural barrier for the counterpart material and increases its tribological properties. Obtained results suggest that alloy recasting does not constitute a limitation to its use. ? 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The e-CoVig provides a set of functionalities for remote reporting of symptoms, vital signs, and other clinical information to the health services taking care of these patients. The application is designed to register and transmit the heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, respiration, and cough. The system features a mobile application, a web/cloud platform, and a low-cost specific device to acquire the temperature and SpO2.

DESIGN In two placebo-controlled studies, 279 patients were randomized to 1,800 mg G-GR and 270 to placebo with the evening meal; patients underwent a 2-week dose titration, followed by 8 weeks of stable dosing, and 1 week of dose tapering. Patients. Adults with PHN for 6 months and an average baseline Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score of 4 were included in the study. OUTCOME MEASURES Percent change from baseline to week 10 in NPRS scores and the percentage of responders (defined as 30% reduction in NPRS scores from baseline to week 10) were determined. METHODS Patients randomized to G-GR were categorized at each week based on their percent pain reduction up to that week, and for each category, the percentage of week 10 responders was computed. For several early-improvement criteria, the percentage of week 10 responders, odds ratios for achieving week 10 treatment response, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. RESULTS There was a significant positive association between early pain reduction and week 10 treatment response. Pain reduction of <10% at week 5 of G-GR treatment was the best early predictor of lack of endpoint response, with only 8% of these patients moving on to become week 10 treatment responders.

This project evaluated patients' perceptions of video consultations and determined if patients seen virtually received the same standard of information by auditing compliance with sending patient information leaflets (PILs) following video consultation. METHOD: The departments PILs were used to create an inclusion list for patients requiring a PIL. A retrospective audit assessed the notes of 100 video consultations for records of if PILs were sent and by what method. The departments PILs were digitalised and a clinical mailbox introduced enabling clinicians to email patients a PIL hyperlink. The audit was repeated for 88 video consultations. Patient and staff feedback was gathered via online surveys. RESULTS: Initially, 51% of cases met the criteria requiring a PIL and 16% of patients were sent PILs. Following mailbox introduction, 53% of cases met the criteria and 94% were sent PILs, 100% via email. Patient and staff feedback was positive regarding video consultations and digital PILS. Technical difficulties were reported in 44% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Patients perceive virtual consultations to be a positive change and the introduction of a mailbox enhances video consultations in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

In this systematic review, we assess the neurological outcomes and complications of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for large vessel occlusions (LVO) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed from December 1, 2019 through September 1st, 2020 using different combinations of suitable keywords. Ten studies reporting EVT outcomes and complications were identified. Two studies that included non-LVO pathologies and COVID-19 negative patients with the outcomes analysis were excluded. Patient demographics, comorbidities, anatomic thrombus location, neurological and angiographic outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies, in addition to our institutional case series, were ultimately included in this review. The mean age was 62.2 years, of which 67.6% were males. M1 segment involvement was the most commonly reported (53.8%) thrombus location. The mean NIHSS at presentation was 20.4 with no significant change at 24 h.

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of young adults (18C25 years of age) assessing respondent characteristics and vaping, tobacco, alcohol, and/or marijuana use. We calculated prevalence estimates, prevalence changes, and prevalence ratios with associated 95% confidence intervals and looked for differences with the chi-square test. RESULTS: Of the total sample, 53.2% (n = 542/1018) young adults reported vaping or using tobacco, alcohol, and/or marijuana. Among the 542 respondents reporting use, 34.3% reported a change in their use patterns. Among respondents reporting changes in substance use patterns during the pandemic (n = 186), 68.8% reported an increase in alcohol use, 44.0% reported a decrease in vaping product use, and 47.3% reported a decrease in tobacco product use due to COVID-19.

This review incorporates patents filed between 2012 and 2016 mostly related to anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-HIV, anti-gastric ulcer, anti-gastritis, antiparasitic and some other biological effects demonstrated by isoflavone analogs. Expert opinion: The number of interesting patents published during the five year period (2012-2016) on the therapeutic potential of isoflavones indicated the importance of this molecule. Natural isoflavones possess potent anticancer, anti-HIV and antidiabetic activities and chemical analogs of natural isoflavones increase the abovementioned biological effects. Additionally isoflavones have only been tested for a limited number of biological activities and thus future research should focus on additional biological activities viz., anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, and anti-leishmanial effects. However, the absence of SAR studies and in vivo data restricted the rational design of more potent isoflavone analogs and we believe that in order to get lead compounds, there needs to be a greater focus on SAR and in vivo studies.","output":"A patent review of the therapeutic potential of isoflavones (2012-2016)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world endures the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the conditions of 35 million vulnerable individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs) worldwide have not received sufficient attention for their special health and medical needs.

Twenty-eight ROPs of Eimeria tenella have been predicted by genomic approaches, and in the present study, E. tenella rhoptry protein 30 (EtROP30) was characterized. Subcellular localizations of EtROP30 in sporozoites and merozoites were in the apical complex and rhoptry-like bulb, suggesting that EtROP30 is a member of ROPs in E. tenella. Sequence analysis showed that EtROP30 contained an N-terminal secretory signal, a protein kinase domain with eight E. tenella-specific rhoptry kinase 1 subfamily (ROPK-Eten1) motifs, and a C-terminal nuclear localization sequence (NLS), making EtROP30 the only ROP that contains both a secretory signal and an NLS in E. tenella. Subsequent experiments showed that EtROP30 was a secreted protein in the sporozoite stage, relying on NLS for migration to the host nucleus. In addition, EtROP30 showed significantly higher expression levels in the parasite merozoite stage, indicating that EtROP30 plays a critical role during parasite reinvasion and development and may be a viable option as a vaccine candidate for anti-parasitic infection.

To investigate the usefulness of a serological assay to predict vaccine efficacy, we analyzed the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in the sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals in Japan. METHODS: This study included 219 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2. The levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against RBD were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after the first and second vaccination, respectively. The relationship between antibody levels and several factors including age, gender, and hypertension were analyzed. Virus-neutralizing activity in sera was measured to determine the correlation with the levels of antibodies. A chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method to measure IgG against RBD was developed and validated for the clinical setting. RESULTS: The levels of all antibody isotypes were increased after vaccination. Among them, RBD-IgG was dramatically increased after the second vaccination. The IgG levels in females were significantly higher than in males. There was a negative correlation between age and IgG levels in males. The IgG levels significantly correlated with the neutralizing activity. The CLEIA assay measuring IgG against RBD showed a reliable performance and a high correlation with neutralizing activity.

Targeted approaches to change prescription behavior are scarce. This study aimed at identifying specific barriers and facilitators for prudent antibiotic use in German dentistry by using qualitative methods. Nine in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions with another nine dentists were conducted and analyzed thematically. Dentists described being conflicted by the discordance of available treatment time and the necessity of thorough therapy. Lacking the opportunity of follow-up led to uncertainty. Dentists felt a lack of medical competency concerning prophylaxis for infectious endocarditis. A lack of empowerment to make therapeutic decisions interfered with guideline-conformity. The communication with fellow physicians is conflictual and improvement was wished for. In consequence, dentists felt pressure by potential medico-legal liability. Patients demanding quick and easy pain relief put extra strain on the interviewed dentists. Our hypotheses concord with preliminary data, mainly from the UK, but highlighted specifically medico-legal concerns and interprofessional communication as even greater barriers as described before.

Fresh SS (FSS) was generated continuously from the reference cigarette 2R1. Room-aged SS (RASS) was generated by aging FSS for 1.5 h in a room with noninert surfaces with materials typically found in residences or offices. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were head-only exposed to three dose levels of each SS type and to filtered, conditioned fresh air (sham-exposure) for 6 h/day, 7 days/week, for 90 days. Room-aging resulted in decreased concentrations of various SS components, e.g., total participate matter (TPM) and nicotine, while other components, such as carbon monoxide (CO), were not affected. The CO concentrations were 6, 13, and 28 ppm for both SS types. TPM concentrations were between 0.6 and 8.7 (g/liter and thus up to 100-fold above the maximum of average concentrations of respiratory suspended particles reported for environmental tobacco smoke. Slight reserve cell hyperplasia in the anterior part of the nose as well as hyperplastic and metaplastic epithelial changes in the larynx were the only observed dose-dependent findings. The metabolism of benzo(a)-pyrene-as a proxy for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism-was induced in the nasal respiratory epithelium and in the lungs while no effect was seen in the nasal olfactory epithelium. The lowest-observed effect level was 6 ppm CO or 0.6 g TPM/liter. Most of the effects seen were less expressed in RASS- than in FSS-exposed rats when compared on the basis of the CO concentrations. When compared on the basis of TPM, these effects were equally pronounced for both SS types, suggesting a major role of particulate matter-associated compounds.

DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional research study involving 736 nurses working in COVID-19 designated hospitals and health units in Region 8, Philippines. Four structured self-report scales were used, including the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire, and the single-item measure for perceived health. RESULTS: The prevalence of coronaphobia was 54.76% (n = 402): 37.04% (n = 130) in hospital nurses and 70.91% (n = 273) in public health nurses. Additionally, nurses' gender (? = 0.148, p < .001), marital status (? = 0.124, p < .001), job status (? = 0.138, p < .001), and personal resilience (? = -0.167, p = .002) were identified as predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. A small proportion of nurses were willing (19.94%, n = 70) and fully prepared (9.40%, n = 33) to manage and care for coronavirus patients.

Information on the immunological processes at play during RSV infection in specific risk groups is essential for the rational and targeted design of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we assessed the antibody and local cytokine response to RSV infection in community-dwelling older adults (60 years of age). During three winters, serum and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from study participants during acute respiratory infection and recovery. RSV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and virus neutralization assays were performed on serum samples from RSV-infected individuals (n = 41) and controls (n = 563 and n = 197, respectively). Nasal RSV IgA and cytokine concentrations were determined using multiplex immunoassays in a subset of participants. An in vitro model of differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells was used to assess RSV-induced cytokine responses over time. A statistically significant increase in serum neutralization titers and IgG concentrations was observed in RSV-infected participants compared to controls. During acute RSV infection, a statistically significant local upregulation of beta interferon (IFN-), IFN-1, IFN-, interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), IL-6, IL-10, CXCL8, and CXCL10 was found. IFN-, IFN-1, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were also upregulated in the epithelial model upon RSV infection. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the basic immune response to RSV infection in an important and understudied risk population, providing leads for future studies that are essential for the prevention and treatment of severe RSV disease in older adults. IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause severe morbidity and mortality in certain risk groups, especially infants and older adults. Currently no (prophylactic) treatment is available, except for a partially effective yet highly expensive monoclonal antibody. RSV therefore remains a major public health concern. To allow targeted development of novel vaccines and therapeutics, it is of great importance to understand the immunological mechanisms that underlie (protection from) severe disease in specific risk populations. Since most RSV-related studies focus on infants, there are only very limited data available concerning the response to RSV in the elderly population. Therefore, in this study, RSV-induced antibody responses and local cytokine secretion were assessed in community-dwelling older adults. These data provide novel insights that will benefit ongoing efforts to design safe and effective prevention and treatment strategies for RSV in an understudied risk group.","output":"Antibody and Local Cytokine Response to Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Community-Dwelling Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION This study aimed to investigate the relationships between timing of the first physician visit after detection of an abnormal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value at routine annual check and the time to antidiabetic treatment prescription; and understand treatment patterns in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS This retrospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study examined data from JMDC Inc., an administrative claims database. Patients with HbA1c value of at least 6.5% at routine annual check, aged 20 years or older, and prescribed at least one antidiabetic drug were included. This cohort was classified into early physician visit and delayed physician visit groups based on the timing of the first physician visit relative to the median. Patients were monitored from the date of first HbA1c checkup of at least 6.5% to the date of first physician visit with an HbA1c test, and from the date of the first physician visit to the date of prescription of first-line and second-line T2DM treatments. The time to first prescription of antidiabetic treatment for the two groups was then compared. RESULTS Of 4798 eligible patients, 54.8% were prescribed first-line T2DM therapy less than 2 months from the first physician visit for T2DM diagnosis. A lower percentage of the early group compared with the delayed group required T2DM pharmacological therapy in less than 2 months (46.1% vs. 63.4%). The early group had a longer median time to prescription of first-line therapy [92 days vs. 15 days, p < 0.0001; hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24, 1.39] and second-line therapy (1599 days vs. 1315 days, p < 0.0001; HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11, 1.34) compared with the delayed group.

To examine, in male lowlanders, whether, and to what extent, hypoxia would modulate thermoregulatory effector responses during repeated whole-body cold stress encountered in a single day. What is the main finding and its importance? A 10-h sustained exposure to hypoxia appears to mediate a gradual upregulation of endogenous heat production, preventing the progressive hypothermic response prompted by the serial cold stimuli. Also, hypoxia progressively degraded mood, and compounded the perceived thermal discomfort, and sensations of fatigue and coldness. ABSTRACT We examined whether hypoxia would modulate thermoeffector responses during repeated cold stress encountered in a single day. Eleven men completed two 10-h sessions, while breathing, in normobaria, either normoxia or hypoxia (PO2 : 12 kPa). During each session, subjects underwent sequentially three 120-min immersions to the chest in 20C water (CWI), interspersed by 120-min rewarming. In normoxia, the final drop in rectal temperature (Trec ) was greater in the third (1.2C) than in the first and second (0.9C) CWIs (P < 0.05). The first hypoxic CWI augmented the Trec fall (1.2C; P = 0.002); but the drop in Trec did not vary between the three hypoxic CWIs (P = 0.99). In normoxia, the metabolic heat production (M) was greater during the first half of the third CWI than during the corresponding part of the first CWI (P = 0.02); yet the difference was blunted during the second half of the CWIs (P = 0.89). In hypoxia, by contrast, the increase in M was augmented by 25% throughout the third CWI (P < 0.01). Regardless of the breathing condition, the cold-induced elevation in MAP was blunted in the second and third CWI (P < 0.05). Hypoxia aggravated the sensation of coldness (P = 0.05) and thermal discomfort (P = 0.04) during the second half of the third CWI. Present findings therefore demonstrate that prolonged hypoxia mediates, in a gradual manner, metabolic and thermoperceptual sensitization to repeated cold stress.

We have previously reported that ADAM17 is able to mediate the cleavage secretion of the ectodomain of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In this study, we demonstrate that purified recombinant human ADAM17 is able to cleave a 20-amino acid peptide mimetic corresponding to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of human ACE2 between Arg(708) and Ser(709). A series of peptide analogues were also synthesized, showing that glutamate subtitution at Arg(708) and/or Arg(710) attenuated the cleavage process, while alanine substitution at Arg(708) and/or Ser(709) did not inhibit peptide cleavage by recombinant ADAM17. Analysis of CD spectra showed a minimal difference in the secondary structure of the peptide analogues in the buffer system used for the ADAM17 cleavage assay. The observation of the shedding profiles of ACE2 mutants expressing CHO-K1 and CHO-P cells indicates that the Arg(708)  Glu(708) mutation and the Arg(708)Arg(710)  Glu(708)Glu(710) double mutation produced increases in the amount of ACE2 shed when stimulated by phorbol ester PMA. In summary, we have demonstrated that ADAM17 is able to cleave ACE2 peptide sequence analogues between Arg(708) and Ser(709).

We aimed to develop and test the acceptability and feasibility of BOOST pACP (Benefits of Obtaining Ownership Systematically Together in paediatric Advance Care Planning) C an intervention to improve ACP in adolescents with cancer, their parents and paediatric oncologists. METHODS: Several methods informed the intervention development process: 1) Problem identification: interviews with 11 healthcare professionals working in paediatric oncology; 2) Identification of evidence: literature review of existing pACP tools and barriers and facilitators in performing pACP; 3) Logic model and 4) Intervention design: collaborative expert meetings with researchers and professionals in pACP; 5a) Acceptability test of the materials: interviews with nine healthcare professionals, four adolescents and young adults with cancer and six parents; 5b) Feasibility test of core intervention components with three families, including interviews about their experiences. RESULTS: The BOOST pACP intervention was iteratively developed and adapted, based on feedback from families, healthcare professionals, and pACP experts (e.g., components were changed, deleted, and added; formulation of themes and associated questions were amended to enhance acceptability). The core components of the BOOST pACP intervention include: four ACP conversation sessions with the adolescent and/or parent(s) provided by a trained facilitator, structured by interactive conversation cards covering different ACP themes, followed by a transfer of information from the intervention facilitator to the paediatric oncologist. Core intervention components were deemed feasible by all participating families. CONCLUSION: The BOOST pACP intervention was developed by close involvement of both adolescent patients and their parents, healthcare professionals and pACP experts. The final intervention and supporting materials are considered appropriate and feasible.

Exposure to hard-to-prognosticate labor market shocks can heighten perceptions of economic vulnerability and unfairness and alter peoples' policy preferences;on the other hand, belief in the tenets of the \`American Dream' might prevent change. We field a large-scale survey experiment on a representative sample (N = 4;000) of US residents, where we inform respondents that automation will increase inequality or that luck or decisions made by elites (rather than individual effort) will determine who loses out. We find that belief in the American Dream is relatively immutable, and preferences for redistributive policies modestly increase only where pre-treatment baseline support was sufficiently high, relatively depolarized along partisan lines, or where respondents exhibit anti-elite sentiment. However, leveraging the labor market shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to create state-of-the-art re-centered IVs, we causally identify that lived experience of job loss interacts with our informational treatments to increase preferences for several innovative redistributive policies (e.g., UBI). This interaction overrides opposition to redistribution (among Democrats and Republicans alike) stemming from aversion to state intervention in the economy by heightening perceived economic vulnerability and redirecting anger towards economic elites {especially among respondents with stronger populist affinities. We probe the mechanisms at play by investigating how people reason about different redistributive policies.

It is based on the premise that the power of evolutionary selection may lead to thermotolerant organisms that will repopulate the planet and continue life in general, but perhaps with different kinds of flora and fauna. Our focus is on molecular mechanisms, whereby known examples of thermoresistance and their physicochemical characteristics were noted. A comparison of interactions of diverse residues in proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms, as well as reverse genetic studies, revealed a set of imprecise molecular signatures that pointed to major roles of hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds, ionic and -electron interactions, and an overall condensed packing of the higher-order structure, especially in the hydrophobic regions. Regardless of mutations, specialized protein chaperones may play a cardinal role. In evolutionary terms, thermoresistance to global warming will likely occur in stepwise mutational changes, conforming to the molecular signatures, such that each intermediate fits a temporary niche through punctuated equilibrium, while maintaining protein functionality. Finally, the population response of different species to global warming may vary substantially, and, as such, some may evolve while others will undergo catastrophic mass extinction.","output":"Evolution of Protein Structure and Stability in Global Warming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Advance care planning (ACP) conversations represent an important physician skill, a need further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most resident ACP training occurs in inpatient, settings, often featuring goals of care (GOC) conversations during a crisis. Outpatient clinics are valuable but underutilized settings to provide skills training for residents, yet little research has been done in these spaces. OBJECTIVE We sought to (1) create an ACP curriculum harnessing the principles of a community of practice in a virtual format, and (2) obtain residents' perspectives regarding their skills and confidence in having early GOC conversations in the outpatient setting. METHODS We interviewed 48 internal medicine residents using questionnaires, reflective narratives, and transcripts of debrief conversations. We created a virtual curriculum during the ambulatory week which included didactics, virtual role plays, ACP phone conversations with five patients, and group debriefs. Quantitative data were analyzed for changes in resident confidence. Qualitative data were coded using thematic analysis, guided by instructor field notes. RESULTS Residents reported decreased confidence in navigating advance directive conversations following training [Z=2.24, p=0.03, r = 0.33]. Resident reflections indicated that they felt more practiced at inpatient late GOC conversation skills, and that these skills were not fully transferable to the outpatient early GOC setting. Residents also endorsed the ambulatory environment as the best space for ACP conversations. CONCLUSIONS This study illustrates the feasibility of a virtual format for ACP curriculum. The virtual community of practice created space for a metacognitive unmasking of prior resident unconscious incompetence. Also, inpatient, crisis-oriented late GOC conversation skills may translate poorly to the outpatient setting requiring early and ongoing GOC skills. Residents need more training to navigate ACP conversations in ambulatory environments.","output":"Training residents in virtual advance care planning: A new twist in telehealth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease that currently lacks standardized and established laboratory markers to evaluate its severity. In COVID-19 patients, the number of platelets (PLTs) and dynamic changes of PLT-related parameters are currently a concern. The present paper discusses the potential link between PLT parameters and COVID-19. Several studies have identified a link between severe COVID-19 patients and specific coagulation index, in particular, high D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time, and low PLT count. These alterations reflect the hypercoagulable state present in severe COVID-19 patients, which could promote microthrombosis in the lungs, as well as in other organs. Further information and more advanced hematological parameters related to PLTs are needed to better estimate this link, also considering COVID-19 patients at different disease stages and stratified in different cohorts based on preexisting co-morbidity, age, and gender. Increasing the understanding of PLT functions in COVID-19 will undoubtedly improve our knowledge on disease pathogenesis, clinical management, and therapeutic options, but could also lead to the development of more precise therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients.","output":"Platelet functions and activities as potential hematologic parameters related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the physical health and mental health of the community, including healthcare workers. Several studies have shown symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in healthcare workers during this pandemic.

Resilience is a persons ability to rise and adapt when times are difficult and is considered to have a protective effect on mental problems. PURPOSE: This study aims to determine the correlation between resilience and anxiety in healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was a cross-sectional study with observational analytic methods. The respondents were healthcare workers at Dr. Soetomo Hospital as the COVID-19 referral hospital in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. Data were collected from 10 to 16 June 2020 by distributing online questionnaires through the Google form application. There were three questionnaires used: demographic data, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire, and the ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale (CR-RISC) questionnaire. RESULTS: The 227 respondents had filled out the questionnaire online with 33% had high state anxiety and 26.9% had high trait anxiety. The mean score of the respondents resilience was 69  15.823. The Spearman correlation test showed a significant relationship between anxiety and resilience (p <0.05), both S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety.

Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S (SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to that of SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector cell-target cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 was limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target cell-effector cell fusion was unaltered compared to that of wild-type (wt) SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2 cleavage (S2') site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor bromhexine, unlike the inhibitor camostat, was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S. Paradoxically, bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity under some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend toward weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Cell-cell fusion allows viruses to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2' cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those, greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently being tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that bromhexine enhances fusion under some conditions. We therefore caution against the use of bromhexine in high dosages until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound ambroxol, which similarly to bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for ambroxol.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-Mediated Cell-Cell Fusion Differ in Their Requirements for Receptor Expression and Proteolytic Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In November 2019, scholars and practitioners from ten higher education institutions celebrated the launch of the iKudu project.

Detailed plans for 2020 were discussed including a series of site visits and face-to-face training. However, the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the plans in ways that could not have been foreseen and new ways of thinking and doing came to the fore.

We then discuss how alongside the focus of iKudu in the delivery of an internationalised and transformed curriculum using COIL, we have, by our very approach as project partners, adopted the principles of COIL exchange. A positive impact of the pandemic was that COIL offered a consciousness raising activity, which we suggest could be used more broadly in order to help academics think about international research practice partnerships, and, as in our situation, how internationalised and decolonised curriculum practices might be approached.","output":"Adapting a Capacity-Development-in-Higher-Education Project: Doing, Being and Becoming Virtual Collaboration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nasal epithelium is a plausible entry point for SARS-CoV-2, a site of pathogenesis and transmission, and may initiate the host response to SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral interferon (IFN) responses are critical to outcome of SARS-CoV-2. Yet little is known about the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity in this tissue. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics to a primary cell model of human nasal epithelium differentiated at air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated widespread tropism for nasal epithelial cell types. The host response was dominated by type I and III IFNs and interferon-stimulated gene products. This response was notably delayed in onset relative to viral gene expression and compared to other respiratory viruses. Nevertheless, once established, the paracrine IFN response began to impact on SARS-CoV-2 replication. When provided prior to infection, recombinant IFN or IFN1 induced an efficient antiviral state that potently restricted SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, preserving epithelial barrier integrity. These data suggest that the IFN-I/III response to SARS-CoV-2 initiates in the nasal airway and suggest nasal delivery of recombinant IFNs to be a potential chemoprophylactic strategy.","output":"Delayed induction of type I and III interferons mediates nasal epithelial cell permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a part of the lentivirus genus of the retroviridae family that incorporates its genome into the host DNA via a series of complex steps.

The differences in viral infectivity, replication efficiency, and genome sequences between TW2575/98w and TW2575/98vac were determined and compared. TW2575/98vac caused earlier death of chicken embryos and had higher viral replication efficiency. Thirty amino acid substitutions resulting from 44 mutated nucleotides in the viral genome were found in TW2575/98vac. All of the molecular variations lead to attenuation, found in TW2575/98, were not observed consistently in the other IBVs (TW2296/95, Ark/Ark-DPI/81, the Massachusetts strain, GA98/CWL0470/98, and CK/CH/LDL/97I) and vice versa. After further comparisons and evaluations from three aspects: (1) longitudinal analysis on the timing of variations appeared in specific homologous strain passages, (2) horizontal evaluations with the amino acid changes between wild and vaccine strains among the other 5 IBVs, and (3) inspection on alterations in the chemical characteristics of substituted amino acid residues in viral proteins, four amino acid substitutions [V342D in p87, S1493P and P2025S in HD1, as well as F2308Y in HD1(P41)] were selected as highly possible candidates for successful TW2575/98w attenuation. Our findings imply that molecular variations, which contribute to the successful attenuation of different IBVs, are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid substitutions in viral proteins. In addition, four amino acid changes within the replicase gene-encoded proteins might be associated with TW2575/98 virus virulence.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION: The workgroup members used Internet search engines to retrieve documents from provincial and local hemodialysis programs; provincial public health agencies; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; webinars and slides from other kidney agencies; and nonreviewed preprints. PubMed was used to search for peer-reviewed published articles. Informal input was sought from knowledge users during a webinar. METHODS: Challenges in the care of hemodialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Senior Renal Leaders Forum discussion group. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) developed the COVID-19 rapid response team (RRT) to address these challenges. They identified a pan-Canadian team of clinicians and administrators with expertise in hemodialysis to form the workgroup. One lead was chosen who drafted the initial document. Members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all recommendations in detail during 2 virtual meetings on April 7 and April 9. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CSN COVID-19 RRT, an ethicist, an infection control expert, a community nephrologist, and a patient partner. Content was presented during an interactive webinar on April 11, 2020 attended by 269 kidney health professionals, and the webinar and first draft of the document were posted online. Final revisions were made based on feedback received until April 13, 2020. CJKHD editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. KEY FINDINGS: Recommendations were made under the following themes: (1) Identification of patients with COVID-19 in the dialysis unit, (2) hemodialysis of patients with confirmed COVID-19, (3) hemodialysis of patients not yet known to have COVID-19, (4) visitors; (5) testing for COVID-19 in the dialysis unit; (6) resuscitation, (6) routine hemodialysis care, (7) hemodialysis care under fixed dialysis resources. LIMITATIONS: Because of limitations of time and resources, and the large number of questions, formal systematic review was not undertaken. The recommendations are based on expert opinion and subject to bias. The parallel review process that was created may not be as robust as the standard peer review process. IMPLICATIONS: We hope that these recommendations provide guidance for dialysis unit directors, clinicians, and administrators on how to limit risk from infection and adverse outcomes, while providing necessary dialysis care in a setting of finite resources. We also identify a number of resource allocation priorities, which we hope will inform decisions at provincial funding agencies.","output":"Management of Outpatient Hemodialysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Recommendations From the Canadian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Rapid Response Team"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections due to arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) have dramatically increased worldwide during the last few years. In humans, symptoms associated with acute infection of most arboviruses are often described as dengue-like syndrome, including fever, rash, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and muscular symptoms such as myalgia, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis. In some cases, muscular symptoms may persist over months, especially following flavivirus and alphavirus infections. However, in humans the cellular targets of infection in muscle have been rarely identified. Animal models provide insights to elucidate pathological mechanisms through studying viral tropism, viral-induced inflammation, or potential viral persistence in the muscle compartment. The tropism of arboviruses for muscle cells as well as the viral-induced cytopathic effect and cellular alterations can be confirmed in vitro using cellular models.

Indeed, platelets play a role not only in the innate immune response, through the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and release of inflammatory cytokines, but also in the adaptive immune response, through expression of key costimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules capable to activate T cells. Moreover, platelets release huge amounts of extracellular vesicles capable to interact with multiple immune players. The function of platelets thus extends beyond aggregation and implies a multifaceted interplay between hemostasis, inflammation, and the immune response, leading to the amplification of the body's defense processes on one hand, but also potentially degenerating into life-threatening pathological processes on the other. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge and the most recent updates on platelet immune functions and interactions with infectious agents, with a particular focus on their involvement in COVID-19, whose pathogenesis involves a dysregulation of hemostatic and immune processes in which platelets may be determinant causative agents.","output":"Platelets: 'multiple choice' effectors in the immune response and their implication in COVID-19 thromboinflammatory process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19 and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu Province were analyzed.

For maximum impact, multi-modal MRI protocols will be needed to measure the effects of SARS-CoV2 infection on the brain by diverse potentially pathogenic mechanisms, and with high reliability across multiple sites and scanner manufacturers. MethodsA multi-modal brain MRI protocol comprising sequences for T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (swMRI) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) was defined in close approximation to prior UK Biobank (UKB) and C-MORE protocols for Siemens 3T systems. We iteratively defined a comparable set of sequences for General Electric (GE) 3T systems. To assess multi-site feasibility and between-site variability of this protocol, N=8 healthy participants were each scanned at 4 UK sites: 3 using Siemens PRISMA scanners (Cambridge, Liverpool, Oxford) and 1 using a GE scanner (Kings College London). Over 2,000 Imaging Derived Phenotypes (IDPs) measuring both data quality and regional image properties of interest were automatically estimated by customised UKB image processing pipelines. Components of variance and intra-class correlations were estimated for each IDP by linear mixed effects models and benchmarked by comparison to repeated measurements of the same IDPs from UKB participants. ResultsIntra-class correlations for many IDPs indicated good-to-excellent between-site reliability. First considering only data from the Siemens sites, between-site reliability generally matched the high levels of test-retest reliability of the same IDPs estimated in repeated, within-site, within-subject scans from UK Biobank. Inclusion of the GE site resulted in good-to-excellent reliability for many IDPs, but there were significant between-site differences in mean and scaling, and reduced ICCs, for some classes of IDP, especially T1 contrast and some dMRI-derived measures. We also identified high reliability of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) IDPs derived from swMRI images, multi-network ICA-based IDPs from resting-state fMRI, and olfactory bulb structure IDPs from T1, T2-FLAIR and dMRI data. ConclusionThese results give confidence that large, multi-site MRI datasets can be collected reliably at different sites across the diverse range of MRI modalities and IDPs that could be mechanistically informative in COVID brain research. We discuss limitations of the study and strategies for further harmonization of data collected from sites using scanners supplied by different manufacturers.

However, there is limited understanding of how the nature of ambulance work contributes to this problem, the significant large toll that emergency medical response takes on the individual, and particularly about late and cumulative development of work-related distress among this first responder workforce. METHODS: This study examined peer-reviewed qualitative research published from 2000 to 2018 to outline the effect of emergency medical response work on the psychological, psychosocial, and physical health of paramedics, ambulance officers, ambulance volunteers, and call-takers. Databases searched included: Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Ovid EMcare, PsychInfo and Scopus. The systematic review was organised around five key areas: impact of the work on psychological wellbeing; impact of psychological stress on physical wellbeing; how work-related well-being needs were articulated; effects of workflow and the nature of the work on well-being; and, effects of organisational structures on psychological and physical well-being. RESULTS: Thirty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Several factors present in the day-to-day work of ambulance personnel, and in how organisational management acknowledge and respond, were identified as being significant and contributing to mental health and well-being, or increasing the risk for developing conditions such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Ambulance personnel articulated their well-being needs across four key areas: organisational support; informal support; use of humour; and individual mechanisms to cope such as detachment and external supports. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between critical incidents and workplace culture and demands have an overwhelming impact on the psychological, physical and social well-being of ambulance personnel. These include day-to-day managerial actions and responses, the impact of shift work, poorly-managed rosters, and long hours of work with little time between for recovery. Mental health issues result from exposure to traumatic events, and the way managers and peers respond to worker distress. Ambulance personnel suffering from work-related stress feel abandoned by peers, management, and the service, during illness, in return-to-work, and post-retirement. Policy, programmes and interventions, and education need to occur at an individual, peer, organisational, and government level.","output":"The effects of emergency medical service work on the psychological, physical, and social well-being of ambulance personnel: a systematic review of qualitative research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) is an initiative of the Indian Council of Medical Research and monitored by the National Institute of Medical Statistics (NIMS) since July 20, 2007. Randomized clinical trials are considered as the gold standard in evidence-based medicine. Registration of clinical trials enables disseminating evidence among clinicians, researchers, and patients. It promotes transparency and avoids duplication. The registration process is mandatory for AYUSH clinical trials also. OBJECTIVES This analysis is aimed to determine the different characteristics of registered AYUSH clinical trials in CTRI from 2009 to 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was conducted. The information on registered clinical trials about AYUSH was obtained from the website www.ctri.nic.in from 2009 to 2020 (n = 3632; last accessed on July 30 2020). Data analysis considered the following factors for analysis using descriptive statistics. The number of clinical trials registered in AYUSH stream were classified according to registration type (retrospective/prospective), postgraduate dissertations (yes/no), primary sponsor, type of trial (interventional/observational), study design, health condition and State-wise distribution of sites of studies. RESULTS The number of clinical trial registrations among AYUSH streams (3632) descends from Ayurveda (2054), followed by Siddha (635), Yoga (408), Unani (366) and Homoeopathy (169). Interventional studies dominate observational studies among all AYUSH registered trials. AYUSH streams took four years to register in CTRI due to an increase in reporting trials from 2013. Significant number of trials were registered retrospectively. The order of closure of retrospective registration has influenced an increase in prospective enrolment between 2017-2019. CONCLUSION Registration of clinical trials in the CTRI should be encouraged. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) occupy a rear seat which exposes an opportunity for trials and alarms about weak trials. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are registered more comparatively, which reflects the strength of AYUSH in NCDs. Most of the trials fall under phase 2, which seems to have an increasing opportunity for more trials. Certain visible flaws like registering Phase 2 trials as Phase 3 or 4 and domestic trials as international trials reflect human resources crunch in ICMR-CTRI in Issuing Certificates. These errors should be rectified by training the stakeholders effectively.","output":"Analysis of AYUSH studies registered in clinical trials registry of India (CTRI) from 2009 to 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) patients exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms are reported to have worse prognosis.

Here we test the hypothesis that Ace2 expression in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts is modulated by the microbiome. We used quantitative PCR to profile Ace2 expression in germ-free mice, conventional raised specific pathogen-free mice, and gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota. Intestinal Ace2 expression levels were significantly higher in germ-free mice compared to conventional mice. A similar trend was observed in the respiratory tract. Intriguingly, microbiota depletion via antibiotics partially recapitulated the germ-free phenotype, suggesting potential for microbiome-mediated regulation of Ace2 expression. Variability in intestinal Ace2 expression was observed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota, partially attributable to differences in microbiome-encoded proteases and peptidases. Together, these data suggest that the microbiome may be one modifiable factor determining COVID-19 infection risk and disease severity.","output":"Variability in digestive and respiratory tract Ace2 expression is associated with the microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of COVID-19 related to prevention, coping, and testing of African American residents in under-resourced communities in Alabama. DESIGN: Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, virtual focus groups were conducted in five urban and rural Alabama communities using secure Zoom meetings. Community residents and stakeholders (N = 36 total) participated; meetings were audio- and video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to Thematic Analysis. Themes were organized by the PRECEDE portion of the model in Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling barriers and facilitators in three focus areas: prevention, coping, and testing. RESULTS: Prevention barriers included apathy, difficulty with social distancing, lack of information, mixed messages from authority figures, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Prevention facilitators included concerns about contracting COVID-19, clear and consistent messages from trusted sources, contact tracing, and the provision of PPE. Coping barriers included food insecurity, mental health issues, isolation, economic hardships, lack of health care access, and issues with virtual schooling and church services, which were exacerbated by the inability to connect to the internet. Facilitators to coping included religious faith, increased physical activity, and a sense of hope. Testing barriers included misunderstanding, fear, mistrust, testing restrictions, and location of testing sites. Facilitators to testing included incentives, clear information from trusted sources, convenient testing locations, and free tests. CONCLUSION: Gaining community members' perspectives can identify barriers and facilitators to prevention, coping, and testing and potentially improve outcomes.

The Needs Assessment Tool-Cancer (NAT-C) is a structured consultation guide to identify and triage patient and carer unmet needs. The NAT-C is validated, but its effectiveness in reducing unmet patient and carer needs in primary care is unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Cluster randomised controlled trial with internal pilot and embedded process evaluation to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of the NAT-C in primary care for people with active cancer in reducing unmet patient and carer need, compared with usual care. We will recruit 1080 patients with active cancer (and carers if relevant) from 54 general practices in England. Participating practices will be randomised 1:1 to either deliver an NAT-guided clinical consultation plus usual care or to usual care alone. Consenting participants with active cancer and their carers (if nominated) will be asked to complete study questionnaires at baseline, 1 and 3 months for all, 6 months except for those recruited outside of the last 3 months of recruitment, and attend an NAT-C appointment if allocated to an intervention practice. An internal pilot will assess: site and participant recruitment, intervention uptake and follow-up rates. The primary outcome, the proportion of patients with an unmet need on the Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form 34 at 3 months postregistration, will be analysed using a multilevel logistic regression.

This article describes the author's experience providing nursing care to a female patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Taiwan from overseas. During the patient's period of isolation (February 5th to February 29th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform first-level holistic physical, psychological, and social nursing assessments and collected health-problem information using face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and observations via a remote monitoring system. A second level of assessment confirmed that the problems faced by the patient included (1) existing infections related to COVID-19 and (2) anxiety related to uncertainties about disease prognosis, forgiveness from the family, and potential violations of personal privacy by the media. Due to the special nature of the isolation ward, the author used a remote physiological monitoring system to monitor the vital signs, fever, and shortness of breath status of the patient to quickly decrease her physical discomfort and to improve her self-care ability during hospitalization. Environmental cleanliness was strictly maintained to reduce the risk of cross-infection and ensure patient safety. To alleviate patient anxiety, the author established a good therapeutic interpersonal relationship with the patient by making 10-60 minutes of caring calls to her each day, by providing individual care measures, and by using the Internet to play audio and video to teach mindfulness meditation.

At Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH), a virtual intensive care unit (vICU) was used amid the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to detail the novel adaptations and rapid expansion of the vICU that were applied to achieve patient-centric solutions while protecting staff and patients' families during the pandemic. METHODS: The planned vICU implementation was redirected to meet the emerging needs of conversion of COVID-19 ICUs, including alterations to staged rollout timing, virtual and in-person staffing, and scope of application. With the majority of the hospital critical care physician workforce redirected to rapidly expanded COVID-19 ICUs, the non-COVID-19 ICUs were managed by cardiovascular surgeons, cardiologists, neurosurgeons, and acute care surgeons. HMH expanded the vICU program to fill the newly depleted critical care expertise in the non-COVID-19 units to provide urgent, emergent, and code blue support to all ICUs. RESULTS: Virtual family visitation via the Consultant Bridge application, palliative care delivery, and specialist consultation for patients with COVID-19 exemplify the successful adaptation of the vICU implementation. Patients with COVID-19, who were isolated and separated from their families to prevent the spread of infection, were able to virtually see and hear their loved ones, which bolstered the mental and emotional status of those patients. Many families expressed gratitude for the ability to see and speak with their loved ones. The vICU also protected medical staff and specialists assigned to COVID-19 units, reducing exposure and conserving personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Telecritical care has been established as an advantageous mechanism for the delivery of critical care expertise during the expedited rollout of the vICU at Houston Methodist Hospital. Overall responses from patients, families, and physicians are in favor of continued vICU care; however, further research is required to examine the impact of innovative applications of telecritical care in the treatment of critically ill patients.","output":"Rapid Implementation and Innovative Applications of a Virtual Intensive Care Unit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the determined economic impact of the Sugar industry of the Coronavirus pandemic for aggravating items with a ramp-type demand with inflation effects in two-Distribution center storage devices and waste-material treatment cost using Taboo Search is developed.

MEASURES Modified version of the validated Vaccine Hesitancy Scale assessed vaccine-related beliefs, reasons for hesitancy, external influences on vaccination, and prior vaccination. ANALYSIS Descriptive and inferential statistics provided an overview of the responses and comparisons among subgroups. Logistic regression determined the odds of being hesitant using the listed beliefs and influencers as predictors. Thematic analysis was performed on the qualitative data gathered from free response questions throughout the survey. RESULTS Analysis included 1,002 complete responses (12% response rate [total viewed = 8,331]) with 34.3% indicating hesitancy toward one or more recommended vaccinations, with 53% of which indicating hesitancy to the pneumococcal vaccine despite it being recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for all respondents.

The goal of this research was to determine the immune layer to the measles virus among women in labor and maternity ward personnel in the same medical institution. The levels of IgG antibodies to measles virus in the umbilical cord blood of 594 women in labor and 88 workers of the maternity ward were studied by ELISA. It was revealed that 22.7% of umbilical cord blood serum samples from parturient women and 21.4% of blood serum samples from maternity ward personnel were seronegative (<0.18 IU/ml). Levels of IgG antibodies to measles virus in low values (<1.0 IU/ml) were detected in 67% of blood serum samples among women in labor and 68.9% among employees of the maternity ward. Among women in labor, women under 35 years of age are at the highest risk of contracting measles; the proportion of women with low levels of protective antibodies in this age group was almost 70%, and the proportion of women without protective levels of antibodies was 23%. Compared with the age group 36C43, the age of women in labor under 35 was associated with a higher chance of not having immune protection against infection with measles virus OR [95% CI] = 2.2 [1.1C4.5] (p = 0.02) or had a low level of protection OR [95% CI] = 1.9 [1.2C3.0] (p = 0.001). It was also found that among women over 35 years of age, the proportion of persons with a high level of antibodies in women in labor was statistically significantly higher than among members of the maternity ward staff (13 and 0%, respectively, p = 0.007). Thus, maternity ward employees and women in labor constitute a risk group for measles due to the presence of a high proportion of seronegative persons among women of childbearing age (both maternity ward employees and women in labor).

In this study, we were thus motivated to study the macroscopic shape of assemblies formed through host-guest interaction. We modified crosslinked poly(sodium acrylate) microparticles, i.e., superabsorbent polymer (SAP) microparticles, with -cyclodextrin (CD) and adamantyl (Ad) residues (CD(x)-SAP and Ad(y)-SAP microparticles, respectively, where x and y denote the mol% contents of CD and Ad residues). Then, we studied the self-assembly behavior of CD(x)-SAP and Ad(y)-SAP microparticles through the complexation of CD with Ad residues. There was a threshold of the CD content in CD(x)-SAP microparticles for assembly formation between x = 22.3 and 26.7. On the other hand, the shape of assemblies was dependent on the Ad content, y; More elongated assemblies were formed at a higher y. This may be because, at a higher y, small clusters formed in an early stage can stick together even upon collisions at a single contact point to form elongated aggregates, whereas, at a smaller y, small clusters stick together only upon collisions at multiple contact points to give rather circular assemblies. On the basis of these observations, the shape of assembly formed from microparticles can be controlled by varying y.","output":"The macroscopic shape of assemblies formed from microparticles based on host-guest interaction dependent on the guest content."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This correspondence argues that it is not only rituals after the death of a loved one that are important for grieving and eventual healing but also rituals at the point of death, such as the Last Rites in the Catholic Church.

The business that we are referring to is the business of orthopaedic surgery, encompassing clinical care, education, research, and administration. There is a lack of literature detailing business-continuity plans of surgical departments during pandemics, with new guidelines being developed. A large proportion of orthopaedic work, such as cases of fracture and infection, cannot be postponed. Even elective surgeries cannot be postponed indefinitely as it could result in detriment to the quality of life of patients. The aim of this article is to detail the business-continuity plans at our institution that allowed the delivery of essential musculoskeletal care through personnel segregation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies to ensure the provision of timely medical intelligence, the reduction of nonessential ambulatory visits and surgical procedures, ensuring the safety and morale of staff, and continuing education and research efforts were paramount. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, our posture needs to constantly evolve to meet new challenges that may come our way. Our existing business-continuity plan is not perfect and may not be applicable to smaller hospitals. There is conflict between envisioned normalcy, remaining economically viable as an orthopaedic department, and fulfilling training requirements, and educating the next generation of orthopaedic surgeons on the one hand and the need for segregation, workload reduction, virtual education, and social distancing on the other. Orthopaedic surgeons need to strike a balance between business continuity and adopting sustainable precautions against COVID-19.

Maternal exposure to PM during pregnancy is particularly harmful to childrens health since this is a phase of rapid human growth and development. METHOD: In this review, we synthesize the scientific evidence on adverse health outcomes in children following prenatal exposure to the smallest toxic components, fine (PM(2.5)) and ultrafine (PM(0.1)) PM. We highlight the established and emerging findings from epidemiologic studies and experimental models. RESULTS: Maternal exposure to fine and ultrafine PM directly and indirectly yields numerous adverse birth outcomes and impacts on childrens respiratory systems, immune status, brain development, and cardiometabolic health. The biological mechanisms underlying adverse effects include direct placental translocation of ultrafine particles, placental and systemic maternal oxidative stress and inflammation elicited by both fine and ultrafine PM, epigenetic changes, and potential endocrine effects that influence long-term health. CONCLUSION: Policies to reduce maternal exposure and health consequences in children should be a high priority. PM(2.5) levels are regulated, yet it is recognized that minority and low socioeconomic status groups experience disproportionate exposures. Moreover, PM(0.1) levels are not routinely measured or currently regulated.

The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts to control infectious diseases.","output":"The influence of social behaviour on competition between virulent pathogen strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Greek authorities implemented the strong social distancing measures within the first few weeks after the first confirmed case of the virus to curtail the COVID-19 growth rate.

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study in a public non-university general hospital in the Oslo area, Norway, including a cohort of all 66 patients hospitalised with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the start of the pandemic;13 who died during hospital stay and 53 who were discharged alive. Data were collected consecutively from March 9 th to April 27 th 2020. The main outcome was the ability of the NEWS2 score and other clinical risk scores at emergency department admission to predict severe disease and in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients. We calculated sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for NEWS2 scores 5 and 6, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score 2, 2 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, and CRB-65 score 2. Areas under the curve (AUCs) for the clinical risk scores were compared using DeLongs test. Results: In total, 66 patients (mean age 67.9 years) were included. Of these, 23% developed severe disease. In-hospital mortality was 20%. Tachypnoea, hypoxemia and confusion at admission were more common in patients developing severe disease. A NEWS2 score 6 at admission predicted severe disease with 80.0% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.822, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.690-0.953). NEWS2 was superior to qSOFA score 2 (AUC 0.624, 95% CI 0.446-0.810, p<0.05) and other clinical risk scores for this purpose. Conclusion: NEWS2 score at hospital admission predicted severe disease and in-hospital mortality, and was superior to other widely used clinical risk scores in patients with covid-19.","output":"National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission predicts severe disease and in-hospital mortality from Covid-19 - A prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In November 2019, scholars and practitioners from ten higher education institutions celebrated the launch of the iKudu project. This project, co-funded by Erasmus+1, focuses on capacity development for curriculum transformation through internationalisation and development of Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) virtual exchange. Detailed plans for 2020 were discussed including a series of site visits and face-toface training. However, the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the plans in ways that could not have been foreseen and new ways of thinking and doing came to the fore. Writing from an insider perspective as project partners, in this paper we draw from appreciative inquiry, using a metaphor of a mosaic as our identity, to first provide the background on the iKudu project before sharing the impact of the pandemic on the project's adapted approach. We then discuss how alongside the focus of iKudu in the delivery of an internationalised and transformed curriculum using COIL, we have, by our very approach as project partners, adopted the principles of COIL exchange. A positive impact of the pandemic was that COIL offered a consciousness raising activity, which we suggest could be used more broadly in order to help academics think about international research practice partnerships, and, as in our situation, how internationalised and decolonised curriculum practices might be approached.","output":"Adapting a Capacitydevelopment- In-highereducation Project: Doing, Being and Becoming Virtual Collaboration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific evidence shows a positive association in the etiopathogenesis of periodontitis and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Various confounding factors, such as obesity, diabetes, and inflammation, also play a significant role in the progression of CKD, which remains unexplored. We hypothesise the role of red complex bacteria with various confounding factors associated with chronic kidney disease. The study comprised a total of 120 participants categorised into 4 groups: the control group (C), periodontitis subjects without CKD (P), periodontally healthy chronic kidney disease subjects (CKD), and subjects having both periodontitis and CKD (P + CKD), with 30 subjects in each group. Demographic variables, and periodontal, renal, and diabetic parameters were recorded. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- levels and those of red complex bacteria such as Prophyromonas gingivalis (P.g), Treponema denticola (T.d), and Tonerella forsythia (T.f) were assessed, and the obtained results were statistically analysed. Among the various demographic variables, age showed a level of significance. Mean PI, GI, CAL, and PPD (the proportion of sites with PPD  5 mm and CAL  3 mm) were elevated in the P + CKD group. Diabetic parameters such as fasting blood sugar (FBS) and HbA1c levels were also greater in the P + CKD group. Renal parameters such as eGFR and serum creatinine levels were greater in CKD patients. The estimation of red complex periodontal pathogens such as Pg, Td and Tf levels were significantly greater in the P and P + CKD groups. Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant correlation of red complex bacteria with all variables. Greater levels of P.g, T.d and T.f were found in the P groups, thus indicating their important role in the initiation and progression of inflammation of periodontitis and CKD, with diabetes as one of the confounding factors. The study also confirmed a log-linear relationship between TNF- levels and red complex bacteria, thereby demonstrating the role of inflammatory biomarkers in periodontal disease progression that could contribute to the development of systemic inflammation such as CKD.","output":"Impact of Red Complex Bacteria and TNF- Levels on the Diabetic and Renal Status of Chronic Kidney Disease Patients in the Presence and Absence of Periodontitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak, first reported in Wuhan, China, is gradually spreading worldwide.

The author examines differences between the two business models and analyses various strategies of Airbnb hosts to cope with the crisis. Design/methodology/approach: A detailed empirical analysis is presented based on data from STR and Inside Airbnb for the period January 2018CSeptember 2020. To assess the impact of the pandemic on the hotel industry, year-to-year changes in various performance metrics are presented. The author also investigates the impact of the pandemic on Airbnb prices with panel data regression analysis. Using text-mining methods, signs for new use-cases are explored, including renting flats for home-office or quarantine. Findings: The results support that Airbnb supply is more flexible. While hotel supply quickly returned to a level close to 2019, the average number of Airbnb listings was lower by more than 15%. Furthermore, the price analysis showed that Airbnb rates decreased more moderately than hotel prices. These findings suggest that a significant share of hosts pivoted from short-term accommodation provision and used their property differently, e.g. rented on a long-term basis. The analysis of listing characteristics revealed that the role of longer stays increased;however, the results do not support a shift towards advertising listings for home-office or quarantine purposes.

These appear most likely to reflect immune dysregulation. If similar manifestations can occur with the vaccination remains unknown. RESULTS: In an observational study, we studied 23 patients (92% female; median age 40years) reporting new neuropathic symptoms beginning within 1 month after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. 100% reported sensory symptoms comprising severe face and/or limb paresthesias, and 61% had orthostasis, heat intolerance and palpitations. Autonomic testing in 12 identified seven with reduced distal sweat production and six with positional orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Among 16 with lower-leg skin biopsies, 31% had diagnostic/subthreshold epidermal neurite densities (5%), 13% were borderline (5.01C10%) and 19% showed abnormal axonal swelling. Biopsies from randomly selected five patients that were evaluated for immune complexes showed deposition of complement C4d in endothelial cells. Electrodiagnostic test results were normal in 94% (16/17). Together, 52% (12/23) of patients had objective evidence of small-fiber peripheral neuropathy. 58% patients (7/12) treated with oral corticosteroids had complete or near-complete improvement after two weeks as compared to 9% (1/11) of patients who did not receive immunotherapy having full recovery at 12 weeks. At 5C9 months post-symptom onset, 3 non-recovering patients received intravenous immunoglobulin with symptom resolution within two weeks.

METHODS: We collected routine clinical and laboratory parameters and derived inflammatory indexes on admission in 65 consecutive COVID-19 patients transferred to the Unit of Respiratory and Infectious Disease of the University Hospital of Sassari (North-Sardinia, Italy) who were alive on discharge. RESULTS: Patients with prolonged length of stay (LOS) (PLOS &gt;= 26 days, N.=22) had significantly higher chest CT severity scores, neutrophils, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), aggregate index of systemic inflammation, Systemic Inflammation Response Index, Systemic Inflammation Index (SII), aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and rates of obesity and respiratory support, than non-PLOS patients (N.=43). In univariate analysis, LOS was significantly and negatively correlated with lymphocytes and monocytes, and positively correlated with Body Mass Index (BMI), intensity of care, chest CT severity score, NLR, platelet lymphocyte ratio, SII and LDH. In multivariate regression analysis, only the SII was significantly associated with LOS (beta=0.506, P=0.002) after adjusting for BMI, intensity of care, chest CT severity score and LDH.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of hospital-based group medical quarantine (H-GMQ) on blood pressure (BP) in MHD patients, and the effect of age on change in BP. METHODS: MHD patients in our dialysis center who were under H-GMQ due to exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were enrolled. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were collected from 3 months before H-GMQ to the end of H-GMQ. They were divided into two groups by median age (61 y). BP and related data before and during H-GMQ between groups were analyzed. The association between age and change in BP was estimated using multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty MHD patients were enrolled. The pre-dialysis systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) during H-GMQ were significantly higher than before, the serum sodium decreased significantly at the end of H-GMQ. After adjusting for covariates by multivariable regression, age had a negative correlation with BP elevation (R2 =0.218, P=0.246). Subgroup analysis showed that both pre-dialysis SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) increased significantly during H-GMQ in patients less than 61 years old, instead, neither SBP nor DBP changed in the elderly.

The tail mediates attachment of the virus to the host surface receptor, as well-as ejection of the viral genome into the host. The distal tip of the tail binds the extracellular ectodomain of the Bacillus subtilis receptor YueB, while the tail tube provides a conduit to funnel the viral genome into the host. This process, which culminates with the ejection of the ~44 kb of viral DNA across the thick, cell envelope of the Gram-positive bacterial cell, takes place in a time scale of seconds to minutes and represents a remarkable example of biotransformation. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Auzat et al. provide compelling evidence that the two major structural proteins of the SPP1 tail, gp17.1 (~19.1 kDa) and gp17.1* (~28 kDa), share a common N-terminal sequence, and that gp17.1* is generated by a translational frameshift in the gene 17.1. The extra domain fused to gp17.1* is synthesized by a +1 programmed translational frame-shift at the end of gene 17.1, which leads to the synthesis of approximately one gp17.1* for every three equivalents of gp17.1.

Although outstanding efforts have led to the identification of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus receptors, the receptor for Deltacoronavirus is unclear. Here, we compared the amino acid sequences of several representative CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PDCoV spike (S) protein was close to the cluster containing transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which utilizes porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as a functional receptor. Ectopic expression of pAPN in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells rendered them susceptible to PDCoV. These results indicate that pAPN may be a functional receptor for PDCoV infection. However, treatment with APN-specific antibody and inhibitors did not completely block PDCoV infection in IPI-2I porcine intestinal epithelial cells. pAPN knockout in IPI-2I cells completely blocked TGEV infection but only slightly decreased PDCoV infection. Homologous modeling of pAPN with the S1 C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of PDCoV or TGEV showed that TGEV S1-CTD adopted -turns (1C2 and 3C4), forming the tip of a -barrel, to recognize pAPN. However, only the top residues in the 1C2 turn of PDCoV S1-CTD had the possibility to support an interaction with pAPN, and the 3C4 turn failed to contact pAPN. We also discuss the evolution and variation of PDCoV S1-CTD based on structure information, providing clues to explain the usage of pAPN by PDCoV.

Earlier it was proposed that loop 1 modulates nucleotide affinity to actomyosin and we hypothesized that the electrostatic interactions between loop 1 and myosin head backbone regulate ATP binding to and ADP dissociation from actomyosin, and therefore, the time of the strong actomyosin binding. To examine the hypothesis we expressed the wild type and mutant of the myosin head construct (1-843 amino acid residues) in differentiated C2C12 cells, and the kinetics of ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation and ADP release were characterized using stopped-flow spectrofluorometry. Both constructs exhibit a fast rate of ATP binding to actomyosin and a slow rate of ADP dissociation, showing that ADP release limits the time of the strongly bound state of actomyosin. We observed a faster rate of ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation with the mutant, compared to the wild type actomyosin. The rate of ADP release from actomyosin remains the same for the mutant and the wild type actomyosin. We conclude that the flexibility of loop 1 is a factor affecting the rate of ATP binding to actomyosin and actomyosin dissociation.

METHODS: Data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and the World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) were extracted as the training set and the data from Mar 6 to 9 as the validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death were collected and analyzed. We analyzed the data above through the State Transition Matrix model. RESULTS: The optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of ? 3.87%), the cautiously optimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of ? 2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of ? 1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China.

Here, we examine the effects of interval administration of low-dose recombinant IL-2 (iLD-IL-2) using high-resolution, single-cell multiomics. We confirmed that iLD-IL-2 selectively expands thymic-derived FOXP3+HELIOS+ Tregs and CD56br NK cells, and provide new evidence for an IL-2-induced reduction of highly differentiated IL-21-producing CD4+ T cells. We also discovered that iLD-IL-2 induces an anti-inflammatory gene expression signature, which was detected in all T and NK cell subsets even one month after treatment. The same signature was present in COVID-19 patients, but in the opposite direction. These findings indicate that the sustained Treg and CD56br NK cell increases induced by our 4-week iLD-IL2 treatment create a long-lasting and global anti-inflammatory environment, warranting further investigations of the potential clinical benefits of iLD-IL-2 in immunotherapy, including the possibility of reversing the pro-inflammatory environment in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Low-dose IL-2 reduces IL-21+ T cells and induces a long-lived anti-inflammatory gene expression signature inversely modulated in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To analyze survival, neurologic injury, and kidney function after acute type A aortic dissection. METHODS A total of 445 patients undergoing surgery for acute type A aortic dissection were analyzed. Evaluation according to risk factors for mortality, neurologic injury, and kidney function was performed. RESULTS Overall 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 82.8  1.8%, 73.6  2.4%, and 59.3  3.9, respectively. Independent preoperative risk factors for mortality were preexisting renal impairment (p = 0.001), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and age (p < 0.001). Perioperative risk factors were prolonged cross-clamp (p < 0.001) and cerebral perfusion time (p = 0.001). Risk factors for renal failure were preexisting renal impairment (p < 0.001), prolonged cross-clamp time (p < 0.001), cerebral perfusion time (p < 0.001), and age (p = 0.022). Risk factors for neurologic injury were cross-clamp time (p = 0.038), cerebral perfusion time (p = 0.007), and age (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION In addition to classic risk factors, survival after type A aortic dissection is affected by preexisting renal impairment. Preexisting renal impairment is predictive of postoperative renal failure. Therefore treatment and prevention strategies for renal failure during the acute and long-term course after acute type A aortic dissection are warranted.","output":"Survival, Neurologic Injury, and Kidney Function after Surgery for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Many studies have attempted to measure the workplace morale of academic librarians through related variables such as job satisfaction. Other studies have taken a qualitative or phenomenological approach to understanding workplace morale. This exploratory study has two objectives: (1) to quantitatively measure the workplace morale of academic librarians to set an initial baseline measure for future research and (2) to analyze the variables that impact academic librarian morale with an emphasis on the variables that academic library supervisors directly influence. Findings suggest the workplace morale of academic librarians is predicted by several variables within a supervisor's influence including feedback, work autonomy, and supervisor qualities such as communication, transparency, and empowering subordinates. Outside of a small negative relationship to age and work experience, demographics were largely found to not be a predictor of workplace morale. This study also evaluated workplace morale as a predictor of turnover intention in academic librarians. There was a strong statistically significant negative correlation between workplace morale and the turnover intention of academic librarians.","output":"Quantitative analysis of workplace morale in academic librarians and the impact of direct supervisors on workplace morale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This preliminary study examined how personal librarian programs are implemented within medical and academic health sciences libraries. Increasing awareness of these programs and how they are implemented could create a larger and more accessible knowledge base for establishing best practices that similar libraries can look to when creating their own programs. METHODS: To characterize existing programs, a twenty-two-item survey was sent to MEDLIB-L, AAHSL-ALL, ARCL-HSIG, and PSS-Lists email listservs in October 2018 to reach a broad audience of medical and academic health sciences librarians. Survey responses were analyzed using Qualtrics and Excel. RESULTS: Of the 2,882 potential email recipients, 49 survey sessions were recorded, and a total of 38 survey sessions were completed (1.3% response rate). Of the 38 completed responses, representatives of 12 libraries (31.5%) reported that a personal librarian program had been implemented at their institution. For implementation, eight libraries involved 1C5 librarians, and four involved 6C10. Librarians were assigned 50C100 (n=6), 101C150 (n=1), or 151 or more (n=1) students each. The identified programs served medical students (n=11), nursing students (n=7), health professions students (n=7), dental students (n=2), and students in other fields (n=4).

The World Health Organizations (WHO) mandate to work on the interface between intellectual property, innovation and access to medicine has been continually reinforced and extended to include providing support to countries on the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities in collaboration with stakeholders. This study analyses the role of intellectual property on access to medicines in the African Region. METHODS: We analyze patent data from the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and Organisation Africaine de la Proprit Intellectuelle (OAPI) to provide a situational analysis of patenting activity and trends. We also review legislation to assess how TRIPS flexibilities are implemented in countries. RESULTS: Patenting was low for African countries. Only South Africa and Cameroon appeared in the list of top ten originator countries for ARIPO and OAPI respectively. Main diseases covered by African patents were HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and tumors. Majority countries have legislation allowing for compulsory licensing and parallel importation of medicines, while the least legislated flexibilities were explicit exemption of pharmaceutical products from patentable subject matter, new or second use of patented pharmaceutical products, imposition of limits to patent term extension and test data protection. Thirty-nine countries have applied TRIPS flexibilities, with the most common being compulsory licensing and least developed country transition provisions.

In Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, there were 1015269 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 969424 recovery cases, and 9328 deaths as of 30 Nov. 2020. This paper, therefore, subjected the daily reported COVID-19 cases of these three variables to some statistical models including classical ARIMA, kth SMA-ARIMA, kth WMA-ARIMA, and kth EWMA-ARIMA to study the trend and to provide the long-term forecasting of the confirmed, recovery, and death cases of the novel COVID-19 pandemic in the GCC countries. The data analyzed in this study covered the period starting from the first case of coronavirus reported in each GCC country to Jan 31, 2021. To compute the best parameter estimates, each model was fitted for 90% of the available data in each country, which is called the in-sample forecast or training data, and the remaining 10% was used for the out-of-sample forecast or testing data. The AIC was applied to the training data as a criterion method to select the best model. Furthermore, the statistical measure RMSE and MAPE were utilized for testing data, and the model with the minimum RMSE and MAPE was selected for future forecasting. The main finding, in general, is that the two models WMA-ARIMA and EWMA-ARIMA, besides the cubic and 4th degree polynomial regression, have given better results for in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts than the classical ARIMA models in fitting the confirmed and recovery cases while SMA-ARIMA and WMA-ARIMA were suitable to model the recovery and death cases in the GCC countries.

The beneficial effects of melatonin on sepsis and viral influenza were demonstrated previously, but its effects on covid-19, especially COVID -19 ICU, is unclear. Therefore, our aim was to determine the effects of melatonin in COVID-19 ICU patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study in which the records of patients admitted to COVID -19 ICU of (XXX) during March to June 2020 were reviewed. According to inclusion criteria, patients who received 15 mg of melatonin daily were called MRG and the rest were called NMRG. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included and analyzed, of which twelve patients were in MRG. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were similar between two groups at ICU admission. Melatonin had no significant effect on ICU duration, CRP and ESR, also the trend of changes was in favor of melatonin. Nevertheless, melatonin significantly reduced the NLR (OR = ?9.81, p = 0.003), and also declined mortality marginally (p = 0.09). Melatonin was well tolerated with no major adverse effects, moreover the thrombocytopenia occurrence was significantly lower in MRG (p = 0.005). In MRG, survival increased and mortality risk decreased, although the difference between groups wasn't significant (p = 0.37), which might be related to the small sample-size.

This study evaluated the potential of screening for dental caries among children using a machine learning algorithm applied to parent perceptions of their childs oral health assessed by survey. Methods: The sample consisted of 182 parents/caregivers and their children 2C7 years of age living in Los Angeles County. Random forest (a machine learning algorithm) was used to identify survey items that were predictors of active caries and caries experience. We applied a three-fold cross-validation method. A threshold was determined by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity conditional on the sensitivity of at least 70%. The importance of survey items to classifying active caries and caries experience was measured using mean decreased Gini (MDG) and mean decreased accuracy (MDA) coefficients. Results: Survey items that were strong predictors of active caries included parents age (MDG = 0.84; MDA = 1.97), unmet needs (MDG = 0.71; MDA = 2.06) and the child being African American (MDG = 0.38; MDA = 1.92). Survey items that were strong predictors of caries experience included parents age (MDG = 2.97; MDA = 4.74), child had an oral health problem in the past 12 months (MDG = 2.20; MDA = 4.04) and child had a tooth that hurt (MDG = 1.65; MDA = 3.84).

The recognizing of a specific serum against pAPN to these proteins was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. The binding ability of the proteins to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, was analyzed by ELISA. The inhibitory effect of these proteins to cell infection by TGEV was analyzed using plaque assays. Our data indicate that three truncated pAPNs positively reacted with the specific antiserum and the major binding regions of pAPN were limited in regions 36aaC223aa, 349aaC591aa and 592C963aa. The proteins showed discrepant binding activity to either pAPN antibody or TGE virions. Moreover, the truncated proteins blocked the infection of cells by TGEV to different extent.

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. METHODSWe established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. RESULTS: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and ~0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients. CONCLUSION: RT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","output":"Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by digital PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Gaps in hate crime and hate incident data are a major roadblock in increasing our understanding of the rising phenomenon of hate in the United States.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving adults who needed a cerebrospinal fluid analysis in an emergency department. Patients were randomly assigned to inhale either 50%N2O-O2 or medical air. The primary endpoint, assessed using a numerical scale, was the maximum pain felt by the patient during the procedure and the maximum anxiety and satisfaction as secondary outcomes. Eighty-eight patients were randomized and analyzed (ITT). The maximal pain was 5.0  2.9 for patients receiving air and 4.2  3.0 for patients receiving 50%N2O-O2 (effect-size = -0.27 [-0.69; 0.14], p = 0.20).

It has been reported worldwide and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. METHODS AND RESULTS To revise the previous American Heart Association guidelines, a multidisciplinary writing group of experts was convened to review and appraise available evidence and practice-based opinion, as well as to provide updated recommendations for diagnosis, treatment of the acute illness, and long-term management. Although the cause remains unknown, discussion sections highlight new insights into the epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, pathology, natural history, and long-term outcomes. Prompt diagnosis is essential, and an updated algorithm defines supplemental information to be used to assist the diagnosis when classic clinical criteria are incomplete. Although intravenous immune globulin is the mainstay of initial treatment, the role for additional primary therapy in selected patients is discussed. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients do not respond to initial intravenous immune globulin, and recommendations for additional therapies are provided. Careful initial management of evolving coronary artery abnormalities is essential, necessitating an increased frequency of assessments and escalation of thromboprophylaxis. Risk stratification for long-term management is based primarily on maximal coronary artery luminal dimensions, normalized as Z scores, and is calibrated to both past and current involvement. Patients with aneurysms require life-long and uninterrupted cardiology follow-up.

This has caused a sudden shift of focus and significant demand on availability, effectiveness, reuse after sterilization and development of facemask. Toward this, three types of masks viz. N95, nonwoven fabric and double layer cotton cloth are being used by the majority of the population across the world as an essential inhalation protective measure for suppressing the entry of virus- laden respiratory droplets. The Filtering Efficiency ( FE ) of these masks are tested for atmospheric and laboratory generated aerosols of size 1.0 m and 102.7 nm particles before and after sterilisation and for the two flow rate conditions corresponding to normal breath rate and during sneezing/coughing. Sterilisation is carried out using a gamma irradiator containing Co-60 source for the two-dose exposures viz. 15 kGy and 25 kGy. The FE of surgical and cloth masks is found to be in the range of 15.760.22 to 22.483.92%, 49.208.44 to 607.59% and 73.153.73 to 90.364.69% for aerosol sizes 0.3?5.0, 1.0?5.0 and 3.0?5.0 m atmospheric aerosols respectively.

The reduction in FE for N95 mask after sterilization is associated with reduction of electrostatic interaction of filter medium with particles laden in the air stream. Instead of disposing of N95 masks after single use, they can be reused a few times as N70 mask during this pandemic crisis after sterilisation.

However, studies on policy management and strategies for handling cases related to oil spills are still limited. As one of the largest oil-producing countries with international shipping traffic, Indonesia is vulnerable to oil spills. Therefore, by drawing upon evidence from Bintan Island, this study aims to provide recommendations for stakeholders concerning governance and policy to address the oil spill case, which has had adverse social, economic, and environmental impacts. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews, focus group discussion, observation, actual online news, and official government reports using a case study approach. The result indicates that the local government is slow in responding to Bintan Islands reoccurring yearly oil spillage. Policy responses are still focused on repressive and conventional methods. Hence, preventive and multi-stakeholder governance is required to handle oil spills.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the host-virus interaction remain poorly understood. Here, we profiled the expression of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in THP-1 cells using the emerging RNA-seq to investigate the transcriptional changes during HCMV latent infection. At 4 days post HCMV infection, a total of 169,008,624 sequence reads and 180,616 transcripts were obtained, respectively. Of these transcripts, 1,354 noncoding genes and 12,952 protein-coding genes were observed in Refseq database. Differential gene expression analysis identified 2,153 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCMV-infected and mock-infected THP-1 cells, including 1,098 up-regulated genes and 1,055 down-regulated genes. These regulated genes were involved in pathways of apoptosis, inflammatory response and cell cycle progression, all of which may be implicated in viral pathogenesis. In addition, 646 lncRNAs (208 known lncRNAs and 438 novel lncRNAs) were upregulated and 424 (140 known and 284 novel) were downregulated in infected THP-1 cells. These findings have provided a dynamic scenario of DE candidate genes and lncRNAs at the virus-host interface and clearly warrant further experimental investigation associated with HCMV infection.","output":"Transcriptome altered by latent human cytomegalovirus infection on THP-1 cells using RNA-seq"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper explores how deservingness features in how line managers and employees with cancer negotiate post-diagnosis support in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach It draws on narrative interview data from people with cancer in the UK who were employed when diagnosed and line managers with experience of managing an employee with cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of occupational health and human resources staff and staff from a UK cancer support charity. Findings It shows that post-diagnosis support for employees with cancer was negotiated in subjective, individualised ways, drawing on pre-diagnosis workplace contribution as well as the perceived deservingness of cancer as an illness. Managerial support for employees with cancer was also influenced by post-diagnosis employee behaviours, particularly those that implied a readiness to return to work. Research limitations/implications The sample size and methods limit the generalisability of the results. However, sampling choices were instrumental in reaching a rich set of data, which enabled deeper understanding of individual workplace negotiations. Social implications Pervasive and unhelpful notions of deservingness in the context of ill-health and disability have distinct and worrying implications for ageing workforces, particularly across the Global North. This has been exacerbated by the ongoing uncertainty and insecurity triggered by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result insight into the management of ill-health at work has never been more relevant, and can be used to inform policy and practice.

Yet, the recent novel coronavirus pandemic has amplified routine burnout to record levels. Practitioners and patients are amid a new dynamic of collective occupational trauma (COT). In this realm, health and behavioral health workers (HBWs) experience the same reality as their patients, families, and support systems; professional boundaries become blurred, leading to heightened levels of emotional vulnerability that can prompt the development of more pervasive psychopathology. This reality has put the Quadruple Aim in peril, with increased workforce turnover, staff shortages, costs, and quality challenges.

Organizational cultures must shift from a \\"process and roll\\" mindset to one that is trauma-informed. Implementation of TIC has yielded successful outcomes for the workforce via enhanced patient engagement, treatment adherence, and successful outcomes. In tandem, TIC leadership and supervision models have had promising results and should be more readily utilized; they acknowledge and address workforce trauma while prioritizing staff health, mental health, and wellness. Failure to shift the culture will result in an ongoing exodus of practitioners, leaving insufficient numbers to render safe, cost-effective, efficient, and patient-centered care. The case management workforce comprises professional disciplines across health and behavioral health, employed in every setting. The expanding workforce presence has put them at risk of COT.

METHODS: The clinical data of 7 COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumothorax admitted to Huanggang Central Hospital from January 3 to March 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment were summarized, and experience in the treatment of COVID-19 was shared. RESULTS: (1) General information: among the 7 patients, 5 were males and 2 were females. Four of them had no underlying disease, and 1 had a history of diabetes and hypertension. One patient had only a history of hypertension. There were 6 cases of right pneumothorax and 1 case of bilateral pneumothorax. The 7 patients had a long hospital stay, all over 4 weeks, mostly complicated with multiple organ dysfunction. (2) Imaging examination: 1 case evolved from the early stage to the advanced stage within 1 week and to the severe stage within 2 weeks. Pneumothorax occurred 4 weeks later, and was absorbed within 2 weeks. The remaining 6 patients presented progressive stage on admission, all of them advanced to severe stage within 1 to 2 weeks, and most of them presented diffused consolidation shadows, striation shadows and fibrosis of both lungs, obvious pleural adhesion, and extremely slow lesion absorption. (3) Treatment: 1 severe patient with pneumothorax 4 weeks after onset was given non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The remaining 6 critically ill patients were treated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Five patients were treated with mechanical ventilation within 3 days after the occurrence of pneumothorax, and 1 patient was treated with mechanical ventilation after 11 days. (4) Outcome: 1 patient without endotracheal intubation was continuously given nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, and the condition was stable.

GHDN hydrogel was compared with GelMA single network and HAMA single network hydrogels through characterization experiments of mechanical properties, optical properties, hydrophilicity and in-situ degradation in vitro. At the same time, the biocompatibility of hydrogel was tested by inoculating rabbit corneal epithelial cells (CEpCs) epidermal cells on hydrogels using CCK-8 test, live/dead staining, immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR. It was found that the GHDN hydrogel has optical transparency in the visible region, and its mechanical properties are better than those of GelMA and HAMA hydrogels, and its hydrophilicity is similar to that of normal human corneas. The results of in vitro hydrogel culture of CEpCs showed that the proliferation of CEpCs on GHDN hydrogel was two times higher than that of HAMA hydrogel, and the expression of specific marker Cytokeratin 3 (CK3) and Cytokeratin 12 (CK12) could be better maintained on GHDN hydrogel.

Our goal was to report our initial experience with combined transcatheter Inovare bioprosthesis implants for severe valve dysfunction. METHODS Among 300 transcatheter procedures, a total of 6 patients had concurrent simultaneous transcatheter bioprosthesis implants for severe mitral bioprosthesis failure (valve-in-valve), with a second valve procedure that included native aortic (n = 2) or degenerated bioprostheses in the aortic position (n = 4). During the procedures, all patients were treated with a balloon-expandable Inovare transcatheter valve, using the transapical approach. RESULTS Patients were highly symptomatic [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV: 100%], with a mean age of 62  5 years, yielding a mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk II (EuroSCORE II) of 24.0  10.1%. There was a mean of 1.6  0.4 prior valve operations/patient, with a median time from prior mitral bioprosthesis surgery of 13.0 (9.2-20.0) years. Device success was 100% according to the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium and the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. During the hospital stay, only 1 patient required dialysis, and the median intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 5.0 (3.2-6.7) days and 16.0 (12.2-21.2) days, respectively. No deaths occurred at 30 days; at a median follow-up of 287 (194-437) days, 1 patient died of a non-cardiac cause and the rest of patients were in NYHA functional class I or II, with normofunctioning bioprostheses. CONCLUSIONS Transcatheter double valve interventions using the Inovare bioprosthesis in this initial series were shown to be a reasonable alternative to redo surgical operations.

However, introduction and uptake timelines have not been comprehensively assessed across the portfolio of Gavi-supported vaccines. METHODS: We analysed median times between introduction milestones from vaccine licensure to country introduction and uptake across six vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), three delivery platforms and 69 Gavi-supported countries. Data were gathered from public, partner and manufacturer records. VPDs and prequalified vaccines analysed included Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTwP-HepB-Hib, pentavalent), pneumococcal disease (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV), rotavirus diarrhoea (rotavirus vaccine, RVV), cervical cancer (human papillomavirus vaccine, HPV), polio (inactivated polio vaccine, IPV) and meningococcal meningitis (meningococcal group A conjugate vaccine, MenA). RESULTS: Median time from first vaccine licensure to first Gavi-supported country introduction across VPDs at a global level (Gavi-supported countries) was 5.4 years. Once licensed, MenA vaccines reached first introduction fastest (campaign=0.6 years; routine immunisation (RI)=1.7 years). Most introductions were delayed. Country uptake following first introduction was accelerated for more recently Gavi-supported RI vaccines compared with older ones. CONCLUSION: Factors accelerating timelines across delivery platforms included rapid product prequalifications by WHO, strong initial recommendations by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, achieving target product profiles on first vaccine licensure within a VPD and completing several VPD milestones at a global level prior to licensure.

Methods: From July 2015 to December 2018, a total of 137 unique CRKP clinical isolates associated with BSIs were collected from 11 Chinese teaching hospitals. PCR and DNA sequencing were used to identify 16S RMTase genes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on all CRKP clinical isolates. Relevant information was extracted from WGS data (antibiotic resistance determinants, K-type and wzi allelic types). All 16S RMTase-producing CRKP clinical isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: In this study, 137 CRKPs were found to harbor at least one carbapenemase gene. Among 137 CRKPs, 78 (56.9%, 78/137) were positive for 16S RMTase genes (5 for armA, 70 for rmtB, 3 for both armA and rmtB) and highly resistant to gentamicin and amikacin (MICs &#8805;256 mg/L). Seventy-five isolates harboring 16S RMTase genes also produced ESBLs. In this study, 5 sequence types (STs) and 6 capsule serotypes were found among 78 isolates positive for 16S RMTases genes, while 14 STs and 6 capsule serotypes were found among 59 isolates negative for 16S RMTases genes. Compared with the isolates negative for 16S RMTases genes, the STs and capsular serotypes of 16S RMTases-positive strains are more concentrated.

Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.","output":"Neural Additive Models: Interpretable Machine Learning with Neural Nets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"DNA binding to TLR9 expressed by red blood cells promotes innate immune activation and anemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus that infected more than 8000 individuals and resulted in more than 800 (10C15%) fatalities in 2003.

In a previous work, by using model membranes we studied P6, a peptide that shows no antimicrobial activity, and P6.2, which exhibits antibacterial activity. In the present work we aimed to unravel the mode of action of these peptides by studying their interaction in vivo with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In this sense, to study the interactions with bacterial cells and their effect on the bacterial surface, zeta potential, spectroscopic, and microscopic methodologies were applied. P6.2 exhibits a higher affinity toward both bacterial envelopes. The ability of both peptides to disrupt afterwards the bacterial membrane was also studied. Both peptides were able to induce bacterial membrane damage, but higher concentrations of P6 were needed to obtain results comparable to those obtained for P6.2. Additionally, P6.2 exhibited faster damage kinetics. Altogether, these data allow postulating, in a physiologic model, that the lower affinity of P6 for bacterial envelope results in a minor final concentration of the peptide in the bacterial membrane unable to trigger the antimicrobial activity. Finally, the fact that the active P6.2 has the same MIC value for the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested, but not the same profile in the permeabilization assays, reinforces the question of whether cell wall components act as electrostatic barriers preventing or minimizing membrane-active AMPs lethal action at the membrane level.","output":"Interactions of \\"de novo\\" designed peptides with bacterial membranes: Implications in the antimicrobial activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Linear models are widely used in the field of epidemiology to model the relationship between placental-fetal hormone and fetal/infant outcome. When researchers suspect curvilinear relationship exists, some nonparametric techniques, including regression splines, smoothing splines and penalized regression splines, can be used to model the relationship (Korevaar et al. 2016; Wu and Zhang 2006). By applying these nonparametric techniques, researchers can relax the linearity assumption and capture scientifically meaningful or appropriate shapes. In this paper, we focus on the regression spline technique and develop a method to help researchers select the most suitable shape to describe their data among increasing, decreasing, convex and concave shapes. Specifically, we develop a mixed effects regression spline to model hormonal data described in this paper. The proposed methodology is general enough to be applied to other similar problems. We illustrate the method using a state-wide prenatal screening program data set.","output":"Shape Detection using Semi-parametric Shape-Restricted Mixed Effects Regression Spline with Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES to identify the Italian provinces with excess mortality during the COVID-19 epidemics using the mortality data provided in April 2020 by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) that, by design, included only the municipalities with at least 20% mortality increase compared to the same period in 2015-19. Inference with the aim to identify increased mortality at provincial level was a very important task when the Istat data were released in April, but the na?ve aggregation of the selected municipalities was not sensible to due to the selection criteria of the municipalities used by Istat. DESIGN use of a permutation-based approach to identify the Italian provinces with excess mortality during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemics using the data made available from Istat and taking into account the biased inclusion criteria. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the number of deaths from any cause from 1 January was available for each year of the 2015-2020 period. Data were stratified by municipality, sex and 21 age categories. The third data release (R3) included 1,686 of the 7,904 Italian municipalities with increased mortality in 2020, covering about 40% of the Italian population. Results were compared with those obtainable with the fifth data release (R5), made available in June, when the selection of the municipalities was no longer based on increased mortality and which included more than 90% of the Italian population. R5 was considered the gold standard. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES excess of deaths from any cause in the Italian provinces between 1 March and 4 April; relative risk (RR); permutation p-values; permutation-based adjusted relative risk; population coverage. RESULTS the results of this study, which are based on two different test statistics, identify 17 and 33 provinces (out of 103) with increased overall mortality, respectively, controlling the family-wise error rate at 0.05 level. Most of the identified provinces are neighbouring provinces in the northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Liguria, Marche and Tuscany, where most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths were identified. The comparison with data from R5 shows that all the identified provinces had an increase in overall mortality, mostly (31/34) above 25%. On average, the adjusted RR slightly underestimates the RR from R5, underestimating the large RR and overestimating the small RR. CONCLUSIONS this was, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first attempt to aggregate the Istat data at province level and obtain a reliable and generalizable statistical inference. This permutation-based approach provides a feasible approach to take into account the selection bias that was present in the data and could be used for analysing other types of data that present some type of selection bias.","output":"Identifying the Italian provinces with increased mortality during COVID-19 epidemics using the data made available by the Italian National Institute of Statistics.

Starting in December 2019 from China, the first cases were officially announced on February 19 in Qom city, Iran. As of April 3, 2020, 206 countries have reported a total of 932166 cases with 46764 deaths. Along with China, USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany, Iran has been suffering the hardest burden of COVID-19 outbreak. Worse still, countries like Iran are struggling with the double burden of political sanctions to provide lifesaving medical equipment and medicines to combat the emergency. METHODS Using systematic document content analysis and through the lenses of health policy triangle, this article aims to compare the policies and strategies that Iran is adopting, with the experience and recommendations of China and WHO to combat COVID-19. RESULTS Iran has formulated contextual-based policies to combat COVID-19 outbreak before and after virus entrance. Insufficient whole-government, whole-society approach in managing the outbreak, inadequate lifesaving and protective equipment, and delayed decisive governance are the biggest challenges in policy making to combat COVID-19. COVID-19 policies are a public health concern and require professional advocacy attempts through appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration and whole-government coalitions. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is an unfolding outbreak; hence, policy learning is crucial to formulate appropriate policies and implement them accordingly. Iran has made many efforts to defeat the outbreak, but more coherent, timely and efficient action is required, now, more than ever, to save lives and slow the spread of this pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and Comparative Health Policy Learning in Iran."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) is quite a challenging experience for the world At the moment of birth, the fetus is prepared to face the challenge of labor and the exposure to the outside world, meaning that labor and birth represent the first extrauterine major exposure to a complex microbiota The vagina, which is a canal for reproduction, is by evolution separated (but not far) from the anus and urethra Passing through the birthing canal is a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of vaginal and gut microorganisms for the vertical transmission of microbiota not only from our mothers and grandmothers but also from earlier ancestors Methods Many national and international instructions have been developed since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan in China All of them pointed out hygiene measures, social distancing and avoidance of social contacts as the most important epidemiological preventive measures Pregnancy and neonatal periods are considered as high risk for Covid-19 infection Results The instructions defined the care for pregnant women in the delivery room, during a hospital stay and after discharge The controversial procedures in the care of Covid-19-suspected or -positive asymptomatic women in labor were: mode of delivery, companion during birth and labor, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and visits during a hospital stay Conclusion There is a hope that instruction on coping with the coronavirus (Covid-19) infection in pregnancy with all proposed interventions affecting mothers, babies and families, besides saving lives, are beneficial and efficient by exerting no harm","output":"Are Covid-19-positive mothers dangerous for their term and well newborn babies?

More than a year later, widespread screening for SARS-CoV-2 is critical to allow schools and other institutions to remain open. Here, we describe the acceptability of a minimally invasive COVID-19 screening protocol trialled by the Western Australian Government to mitigate the risks of and boost public confidence in schools remaining open. To minimise discomfort, and optimise recruitment and tolerability in unaccompanied children, a combined throat and nasal (OP/Na) swab was chosen over the nasopharyngeal swab commonly used, despite slightly reduced test performance. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Trialling of OP/Na swabbing took place as part of a prospective observational cohort surveillance study in 79 schools across Western Australia. Swabs were collected from 5903 asymptomatic students and 1036 asymptomatic staff in 40 schools monthly between June and September 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: PCR testing was performed with a two-step diagnostic and independent confirmatory PCR for any diagnostic PCR positives. Concurrent surveys, collected online through the REDCap platform, evaluated participant experiences of in-school swabbing. RESULTS: 13 988 swabs were collected from students and staff. There were zero positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, including no false positives. Participants reported high acceptability: 71% of students reported no or minimal discomfort and most were willing to be reswabbed (4% refusal rate). CONCLUSIONS: OP/Na swabbing is acceptable and repeatable in schoolchildren as young as 4 years old and may combat noncompliance rates by significantly increasing the acceptability of testing. This kind of minimally-invasive testing will be key to the success of ongoing, voluntary mass screening as society adjusts to a new normal in the face of COVID-19.

Given the delay between risk exposure and disease onset, SCD individuals are increasingly considered a good target population for cost\\\\effective lifestyle\\\\based Alzheimer's disease prevention trials. METHODS: The PENSA study is a randomized, double\\\\blind, controlled clinical trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy of a personalized multimodal intervention in lifestyle (diet counseling, physical activity, cognitive training, and social engagement) combined with the use of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) over 12 months, in slowing down cognitive decline and improving brain connectivity. The study population includes 200 individuals meeting SCD criteria and carrying the apolipoprotein E 4 allele, who will be randomized into four treatment arms (multimodal intervention + EGCG/placebo, or lifestyle recommendations + EGCG/placebo). The primary efficacy outcome is change in the composite score for cognitive performance measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS\\\\PACC\\\\like) adding to the original version the Interference score from the Stroop Color and Word Test and the Five Digit Test. Secondary efficacy outcomes are (1) change in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural neuronal connectivity (structural MRI) and (2) the safety assessment of the EGCG compound. This study is framed within the WW\\\\FINGERS consortium. DISCUSSION: The use of new technologies (i.e., mobile ecological momentary assessments [EMAs], activity tracker) in the PENSA study allows the collection of continuous data on lifestyle behaviors (diet and physical activity) and mood, enabling a personalized design as well as an intensive follow\\\\up of participants. These data will be used to give feedback to participants about their own performance along the intervention, promoting their involvement and adherence.

When done correctly, it provides significant benefits to customers, such as self-reliance and cost savings. Inappropriate methods, on the other hand, such as incorrect self-diagnosis and therapy selection, can be disastrous. The COVID-19 pandemic context may benefit the community in easing the burden on the health system. There have been no studies conducted on this possibility in the context of COVID-19 in a selected area, hence the purpose of this study was to determine the extent of and factors associated with self-medication among clients visiting community pharmacies in west Harerghe, Ethiopia from June 1 to 30, 2020. METHODS: This institution-based cross-sectional study used a systemic random sample of 416 community-pharmacy clients. To collect data, face-to-face interviews were conducted using pretested semistructured questionnaires modified from established techniques. EpiData 3.1 was used to enter data and SPSS 24 for analysis. To determine factors associated with self-medications, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. AORs with 95% CIs are used to report associations, and the level of significance was set at P<0.05. RESULTS: The proportion of people self-medicating was 73.6% (95% CI 69.2%C77.9%).

Contact tracing and case isolation are common methods for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. However, the effectiveness of any contact tracing system rests on public engagement. Numerous factors may influence an individual's willingness to engage with a contact tracing system. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To identify facilitators and barriers to uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. METHOD: A rapid systematic review was conducted to identify papers based on primary research, written in English, and that assessed facilitators, barriers, and other factors associated with the uptake of, and engagement with, a contact tracing system. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four themes were identified as facilitators to the uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing: collective responsibility; personal benefit; co-production of contact tracing systems; and the perception of the system as efficient, rigorous and reliable. Five themes were identified as barriers to the uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing: privacy concerns; mistrust and/or apprehension; unmet need for more information and support; fear of stigmatization; and mode-specific challenges. CONCLUSIONS: By focusing on the factors that have been identified, contact tracing services are more likely to get people to engage with them, identify more potentially ill contacts, and reduce transmission.","output":"Facilitators and barriers to engagement with contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks: A rapid review of the evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We investigated college students' attitude and compliance towards a prevention strategy involving use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Access to outpatient rehabilitation services and their specialized exercise equipment has significantly decreased,2 leaving patients feeling abandoned and surgeons looking for help on how to guide patients postoperative rehabilitation. This poster serves to introduce household items-based personalized video rehabilitation (PVR). METHODS: Rehabilitation exercise videos were produced by a board-certified athletic trainer and board-certified orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon. The videos showed how to perform rehabilitation exercises with common household items (Figure 3).The videos were produced in a structured order, explaining the purpose of the exercise, showing what household items are needed, and demonstrating the proper technique of the exercise. Following recording of the videos, they were assembled into injury/scenario-specific infographics (Figure 1). RESULTS: 34 rehabilitation exercise videos were recorded, with an average length of two minutes, 11 seconds.11 injury/scenario- specific infographics were assembled, with each page of an infographic containing seven exercises (Figure 1), with specific information and access for each exercise (Figure 2).Patients can access the videos by clicking on the hyperlink, or by scanning the QR code.

However, this usage has suffered from an important restriction: the function boundaries are assumed fixed and matched. Functional data exhibiting unmatched boundaries typically arise from dynamical systems with variable evolution rates such as COVID-19 infection rate curves associated with different geographical regions. In this case, it is more natural to model such data with sliding boundaries and use partial matching, i.e., only a part of a function is matched to another function. Here, we develop a comprehensive Riemannian framework that allows for partial matching, comparing, and clustering of functions under both phase variability and uncertain boundaries. We extend past work by: (1) Forming a joint action of the time-warping and time-scaling groups;(2) Introducing a metric that is invariant to this joint action, allowing for a gradient-based approach to elastic partial matching;and (3) Presenting a modification that, while losing the metric property, allows one to control relative influence of the two groups.

This study examined the relationship between healthcare delay and older adults (50 years and over) with chronic conditions in Ireland. METHODS: This study used data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) COVID-19 study and previous waves of TILDA. The COVID-19 study data was collected between July 2020 and November 2020. Taking existing healthcare demand into account, logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between healthcare delay and older adults with chronic conditions. Additional analysis, using multinomial logit regression, explored the reasons for healthcare delay, whether the delays were on the participants behalf or the health service provider. RESULTS: In total, 31.6% of participants reported healthcare delay. Older adults with two or more chronic conditions were more likely to experience healthcare delay than those with no chronic conditions. In the second analysis, older adults with two or more chronic conditions were more likely to have healthcare delayed by the provider and were also more likely to delay their own healthcare than those with no chronic conditions. Additionally, some other groups were more likely to experience healthcare delay such as: people aged 70 years and over, females, those with problematic alcohol consumption, those with third-level education, those who had visited the GP and those who reported polypharmacy. While older adults living with others and those living outside Dublin were less likely to experience healthcare delay.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR analysis for the RdRp, N and E target genes detected viral RNA in different types of biological specimens. Whole viral genome sequences were obtained and analyzed from respiratory tract, feces and blood. RESULTS Viral sequences showed high (~99.9%) homology with the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus. Phylogenetic analysis assigned of the SARS-CoV-2 strains to clade G. A rare variant in the orf1ab gene was present in both sequences, while a missense variant was detected only in viral RNA from stool. CONCLUSIONS The evolution of the COVID-19 systemic infection in the patient presented here was favorable to the hypothesis that immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplant recipients might be involved in viral dissemination. A missense mutation was present in only one specimen from the same patient implying the occurrence of a mutational event in viral RNA, which is suggestive for the presence of an active virus, even though viral isolation is necessary to demonstrate infectivity.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 systemic infection in a kidney transplant recipient: sequence analysis in clinical specimens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the breakout of the disease caused by the new virus COVID-19, the mitigation stage has been reached in most of the countries in the world.

In Colombia, the virus was first detected in the earliest 70's when the disease became a major public health concern. Since then, all four serotypes of the virus have been reported. Although most of the huge outbreaks reported in this country have involved dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1), there are not studies about its origin, genetic diversity and distribution. RESULTS: We used 224 bp corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of envelope (E) gene from 74 Colombian isolates in order to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and to estimate time divergences. Analyzed DENV-1 Colombian isolates belonged to the formerly defined genotype V. Only one virus isolate was clasified in the genotype I, likely representing a sole introduction that did not spread. The oldest strains were closely related to those detected for the first time in America in 1977 from the Caribbean and were detected for two years until their disappearance about six years later. Around 1987, a split up generated 2 lineages that have been evolving separately, although not major aminoacid changes in the analyzed region were found. CONCLUSION: DENV-1 has been circulating since 1978 in Colombia. Yet, the phylogenetic relationships between strains isolated along the covered period of time suggests that viral strains detected in some years, although belonging to the same genotype V, have different recent origins corresponding to multiple re-introduction events of viral strains that were circulating in neighbor countries. Viral strains used in the present study did not form a monophyletic group, which is evidence of a polyphyletic origin.

These technologies hold a number of fundamental challenges and ethical concerns that need addressing to aid the success of this fast-growing field. In particular, the responsible development of such technologies requires caregiver input. We conducted a survey of the opinions of 410 caregivers on the viability, privacy and data access of remote in-home monitoring technologies and study designs. Infant-friendly wearable devices (such as sensing body suits) were viewed favourably. Caregivers were marginally more likely to accept video and audio recording in the home if data was anonymised (through automated processing) at point of collection, particularly when observations were lengthy. Caregivers were more open to international data sharing for anonymous data. Caregivers were interested in viewing all types of data, but were particularly keen to access video and audio recordings for censoring purposes (i.e., to delete data segments). Taken together, our results indicate generally positive attitudes to remote in-home monitoring technologies and studies for infant research but highlight specific considerations such as safety, privacy and family practicalities (e.g. multiple caregivers, visitors and varying schedules) that must be taken into account when developing future studies.","output":"A survey on the attitudes of parents with young children on in-home monitoring technologies and study designs for infant research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three months after a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Kupferzell, Germany, a population-based study (n = 2,203) found no RT-PCR-positives IgG-ELISA seropositivity with positive virus neutralisation tests was 7 7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6 5-9 1) and 4 3% with negative neutralisation tests We estimate 12 0% (95% CI: 10 4-14 0%) infected adults (24 5% asymptomatic), six times more than notified Full hotspot containment confirms the effectiveness of prompt protection measures However, 88% na?ve adults are still at high COVID-19 risk","output":"Serology- and PCR-based cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults in a successfully contained early hotspot (CoMoLo study), Germany, May to June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy is a limiting factor in global efforts to contain the current pandemic, wreaking havoc on public health.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Studies were eligible if evaluating within any cost-consequence framework (eg, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis) or resource use typically considered to fall within the societal viewpoint (eg, cost to payers, service-users, families and informal care costs). SEARCH We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EconLit, Embase and Scopus to September 2017 and supplemented this with grey literature searches and handsearching of the references of the eligible studies. We assessed study quality using the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme suite of tools, excluding those judged to be of poor methodological quality. RESULTS Two studies were included; both were cohort studies from the payer perspective of people leaving long-stay National Health Service hospitals in the UK between 1984 and 1992.

They comprise approximately 1% of all exocrine neoplasms and are classified according to their anatomical sites into main duct-type, branch duct-type, and mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Histological examination plays a crucial role in distinguishing and classifying intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms into gastric, intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and oncocytic subtypes. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 70-year-old Syrian woman who was admitted to our hospital due to an intermittent epigastric pain accompanied by diarrhea and weight loss with a recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Following clinical, laboratory, and radiological examination, distal pancreatectomy involving the body and the tail of the pancreas was performed. Interestingly, histological examination of the resected specimens revealed the diagnosis of a mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with a unique combination of gastric and pancreatobiliary subtypes. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, the combination of multiple histological subtypes of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms has been recorded in a few studies with reference to the challenging histological detection. Herein, we report a rare case with a significant histological combination, highlighting the difficulties in differential diagnosis due to the absence of ancillary techniques, with a brief review on diagnostic methods, histological characteristics and surgical recommendations.","output":"A mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas with a histologic combination of gastric and pancreatobiliary subtypes in a 70-year-old woman: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuromuscular disorders increasingly are recognized as a complication in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and represent a common cause of prolonged ventilator dependency. The distinct syndromes of critical illness myopathy, prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) may arise as a consequence of sepsis, multi-organ failure, and exposure to various medicationsnotably, intravenous corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agentsbut the pathophysiology of these disorders remains poorly understood. More than one syndrome may occur simultaneously, and the distinctions may be difficult in a particular patient, but a specific diagnosis usually can be established after careful clinical, electrodiagnostic, and, when necessary, histological evaluation. For example, asthmatics requiring treatment with corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents may develop an acute myopathy characterized by generalized weakness, preserved eye movements, elevated creatine kinase levels, and myopathic motor units on electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy demonstrates distinctive features of thick (myosin) filament loss on ultrastructural studies. Conversely, those with a prolonged ICU course that is complicated by episodes of sepsis with failure to wean from the ventilator, distal or generalized flaccid limb weakness, and areflexia probably have CIP. EMG in these patients demonstrates reduced or absent motor and sensory potentials with neurogenic motor units. Prolonged neuromuscular blockade most commonly occurs in patients with renal failure who have received prolonged infusions of neuromuscular blockers. There is severe flaccid, areflexic paralysis with normal sensation, facial weakness, and ophthalmoparesis that persists for days or weeks after the neuromuscular blockers have been discontinued. Repetitive nerve stimulation shows a decrement of the compound muscle action potential and, in most cases, establishes a disorder of neuromuscular transmission. With the recent epidemic of West Nile virus infection, a clinical syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis with several features indistinguishable from poliomyelitis has emerged. This article critically examines the clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological features of these and other acute neuromuscular syndromes that arise in the context of ICU care and summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of these disorders.","output":"Approach to neuromuscular disorders in the intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To examine the magnitude of sex differences in survival from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Europe across age groups and regions. We hypothesized that men have a higher mortality than women at any given age but that sex differences will decrease with age as only the healthiest men survive to older ages. METHODS: We used population data from the Institut National Dtudes Dmographiques on cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 from February to June 2020 in 10 European regions: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. For each region, we calculated cumulative mortality rates stratified by age and sex and corresponding relative risks for men vs. women. RESULTS: The relative risk of dying from COVID-19 was higher for men than for women in almost all age groups in all regions. The overall relative risk ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.01C1.23) in Portugal to 1.54 (95% CI 1.49C1.58) in France. In most regions, sex differences increased until the ages of 60C69 years, but decreased thereafter with the smallest sex difference at age 80+ years.

Unfortunately, because of an ever-increasing population of people who are perennially under medication, these wastewaters contain residues of antibiotics and other antimicrobials as well as microbial shedding, the direct and indirect effects of which include the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and an increase in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that pose a threat to public and environmental health. This study assessed the taxonomic and functional profiles of bacterial communities, as well as the antibiotic concentrations in untreated domestic wastewater (DWW) and hospital wastewater (HWW), using high-throughput sequencing analysis and solid-phase extraction coupled to Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UHPLCCMS/MS) analysis, respectively. The physicochemical qualities of both wastewater systems were also determined. The mean concentration of antibiotics and the concentrations of Cl(?), F(?) and PO(4)(3) were higher in HWW samples than in DWW samples. The phylum Firmicutes was dominant in DWW with a sequence coverage of 59.61% while Proteobacteria was dominant in HWW samples with a sequence coverage of 86.32%. At genus level, the genus Exiguobacterium (20.65%) and Roseomonas (67.41%) were predominant in DWW and HWW samples, respectively. Several pathogenic or opportunistic bacterial genera were detected in HWW (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas and Vibrio) and DWW (Clostridium, Klebsiella, Corynebacterium, Bordetella, Staphylocccus and Rhodococcus) samples. Functional prediction analysis indicated the presence of beta-lactam resistance, cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance and vancomycin resistance genes in HWW samples. The presence of these antibiotic resistance genes and cassettes were positively correlated with the presence of pathogens.

Patients prior to stem cell transplant may benefit from symptom control, advance care planning and shared decision-making, and previous studies have demonstrated feasibility and benefit of such a service. However, the views of patients are not yet established, and are vital to ensure acceptability of the service. AIMS: To identify areas where a palliative care team may help to support patients being considered for a stem cell transplant, and to explore the attitudes and perceptions of patients towards palliative care at this time. DESIGN: A qualitative study including interviews (N = 12) and a focus group (N = 4) for patients pre- and post-transplant, using a semi-structured format via telephone, online video-conferencing and face-to-face discussions. Recordings were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. SETTING: A tertiary cancer centre in the UK. FINDINGS: Themes identified were the following: Identified needs, Information and decision-making, Importance of relationships, Changing perceptions of what palliative care means, and The future. Patients associate palliative care with terminal care due to indirect experiences. Patients were open to palliative care once its purpose was explained and described emotional and physical needs relevant to early palliative care. CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of early palliative care alongside haematology treatment prior to stem cell transplant may improve quality of life for patients and facilitate shared decision-making at a crucial stage of treatment.

This study aimed to explore hand hygiene behaviors of general practitioners in nursing homes, their attitudes toward infection prevention measures, and the enablement of nursing home residents in performing hand hygiene measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with general practitioners and nursing home residents in Germany. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 12 general practitioners and 12 nursing home residents participated in the study. The general practitioners expressed the fact that the possibilities for practicing hand hygiene differ in individual nursing homes. For nursing home residents, the availability of hand rub solutions was limited. Instructions for residents on hand disinfection from general practitioners was not described. Due to the lack of enablement, the residents knowledge on how to correctly perform hand hygiene was low, although some of the nursing home residents have experience with multidrug-resistant organisms. The nursing home residents varied in their needs for active participation and enablement during the general practitioners visit. CONCLUSION: Nursing home residents require continuous enablement by their general practitioners to maintain adequate hand hygiene. Therefore, general practitioners should consider the different needs of nursing home residents to ensure adequate individual hand hygiene and safety for the residents.

Among various approaches to supportive therapy that aims to improve mental health in affected individuals, vitamin D supplementation is considered to be an effective method which may also be beneficial in alleviating the symptoms during the course of IBDs and IBS. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature presenting the data regarding the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in adults with inflammatory and functional bowel diseases, including IBDs and IBS. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (Registration number CRD42020155779). A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases was performed, and the intervention studies published until September 2021 were included. The human studies eligible to be included in the review should have described any intervention involving vitamin D as a supplement in a group of adult patients suffering from IBDs and/or IBS and should have assessed any component of mental health, but studies presenting the effects of combined supplementation of multiple nutrients were excluded. After eliminating the duplicates, a total of 8514 records were screened and assessed independently by two researchers. Further evaluation was carried out on the basis of title, abstract, and full text. Finally, 10 studies (four for IBDs and six for IBS) were selected for the current systematic review, and their quality was assessed using the NewcastleCOttawa Scale (NOS). The studies analyzed the influence of various doses of vitamin D on bowel diseases, compared the results of vitamin D supplementation with placebo, or administered specific doses of vitamin D to obtain the required level in the blood. Supplementation was performed for at least 6 weeks. The analyzed mental health outcomes mainly included disease-specific quality of life/quality of life, anxiety, and depression. The majority of studies (including high-quality ones) confirmed the positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on the mental health of IBD and IBS patients, which was proven by all research works evaluating anxiety and depression and by the majority of research works evaluating quality of life. Although the studies followed different dosage regimens and supplementation protocols, the positive influence of vitamin D on mental health was found to be consistent.

The present study included a cohort of 111 people, i.e. 36 COVID-19 patients, 54 sex- and age-matched common viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 21 healthy controls. Monocyte counts, lymphocyte subset counts, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the peripheral blood were analyzed. Higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, monocyte counts, and CRP and ALT levels were found in male COVID-19 patients. Decreased lymphocyte subset counts and proportions were observed in COVID-19 patients, except for the CD3+ and CD8+ T cell proportions. The lower CD4+ T cell proportions and higher CD8+ T cell proportions were observed in male and severe COVID-19 patients and the differences were independent of estrogen level. The CD4+ T cell proportion was negatively associated with the CD8+ T cell proportion in male COVID-19 patients; this correlation was non-significant in females. Our work demonstrates differences between sexes in circulating monocyte counts and CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell proportions in COVID-19 patients, independent of estrogen levels, are associated with the clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients with high specificity.","output":"Sex differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"METHODS: Data on patients aged 19 years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test recorded in the period March 12-May 12 (first wave) and June 19-July 19, 2020 (second wave) were retrospectively analyzed.

Keeping in mind the controversy and progress of the philosophy of social sciences, this paper aims to elaborate on four aspects including the cognitive model, the view of causality, research methods, and analysis techniques, and to establish a more solid methodological basis for historical political science. With respect to the upstream knowledge of methodology, both positivism and critical realism underestimate the tremendous difference between the natural world and the social world. This leads to inherent flaws in controlled comparison and causal mechanism analysis. Given the constructiveness of social categories and the complexity of historical circumstances, the cognitive model of constructivism makes it more suitable for researchers to engage in macro-political and social analysis. From the perspective of constructivism, the causality in storytelling, i.e., the traditional narrative analysis, is placed as the basis of the regularity theory of causality in this paper, thus forming the historicalCcausal narrative. The historicalCcausal narrative focuses on how a research object is shaped and self-shaped in the ontological historical process, and thus ideally suits the disciplinary characteristics of historical political science.

Knowledge of activation of these host response pathways in the lung compartment of COVID-19 patients is limited. Objectives: To evaluate local and systemic activation of coagulation and interconnected inflammatory responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients with persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome. Methods: Paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma samples were obtained from 17 patients with COVID-19 related persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome (mechanical ventilation > 7 days) 1 and 2 weeks after start mechanical ventilation and compared with 8 healthy controls. Thirty-four host response biomarkers stratified into five functional domains (coagulation, complement system, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors) were measured. Measurements and Main Results: In all patients, all functional domains were activated, especially in the bronchoalveolar compartment, with significantly increased levels of D-dimers, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, soluble tissue factor, C1-inhibitor antigen and activity levels, tissue type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type I, soluble CD40 ligand and soluble P-selectin (coagulation), next to activation of C3bc and C4bc (complement) and multiple interrelated cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. In 10 patients in whom follow-up samples were obtained between 3 and 4 weeks after start mechanical ventilation many bronchoalveolar and plasma host response biomarkers had declined. Conclusions: Critically ill, ventilated patients with COVID-19 show strong responses relating to coagulation, the complement system, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the bronchoalveolar compartment.

A multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) is applied, using intraday trade prices with a 15-min frequency from Jan-2020 to Dec-2020. The empirical results confirm that Covid-19 had a significant impact on the efficiency of the stock markets under study, although with a quarterly varying impact. During the first quarter of the year, European stock markets remained efficient compared to Asian markets; in the subsequent two quarters, the Chinese stock market showed significant improvement in its efficiency and became the least inefficient market, with a decline in the market efficiency of the UK and Japan. Furthermore, European markets are more sensitive to asset losses than Asian markets, so investors are more likely to show herding in the former. Herding was at its peak during the 2nd quarter of 2020. These findings could be related to possible market inefficiencies and herding behavior, implying the possibility of investors forming profitable trading strategies.","output":"Herding behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic: a comparison between Asian and European stock markets based on intraday multifractality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern online media, such as Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, enable anyone to become an information producer and to offer online content for potentially global consumption.

In general, consumers preferentially select information that closely matches their individual views and values. The bias inherent in such selection is further magnified by today's information curation services that maximize user engagement (and thus service revenue) by filtering new content in accordance with observed consumer preferences. Consequently, individuals get exposed to increasingly narrower bands of the ideology spectrum. Societies get fragmented into increasingly ideologically isolated enclaves. These enclaves (or echo-chambers) then become vulnerable to misinformation spread, which in turn further magnifies polarization and bias.

To provide evidence on the post-lockdown risk of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, the city government conducted a citywide nucleic acid screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection between May 14 and June 1, 2020. Methods: All city residents aged []6 years were potentially eligible to participate the screening programme. The rate of detection of asymptomatic infected cases was calculated, and their demographic and geographic distributions were investigated. ArcGIS 10.0 was used to draw a geographic distribution of asymptomatic infected persons. Results: The screening programme recruited a total of 9,899,828 persons (response rate, 92.9%). The screening found no newly confirmed patients with COVID-19, and identified 300 asymptomatic infected cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000).

Correlates of increased gambling and increased gambling specifically due to COVID-19-related cancellation of sports were calculated. Four percent reported an overall gambling increase during the pandemic. The proportion of individuals reporting an increase, compared to individuals reporting a decrease, was markedly higher for online casinos (0.62), online horse betting (0.76) and online lotteries (0.73), and lower for sports betting (0.11). Overall, gambling increases were independently associated with gambling problems and increased alcohol consumption. In the sub-group, where there was an increase in specific gambling types in response to cancelled sports betting events, rates of gambling problems were high.

The main aim of this study was to assess the paediatric population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, their clinical parameters, risk factors, and outcome. METHODS: This was a descriptive retrospective study conducted at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences and Federal General Hospital Islamabad from 23(rd) July 2020 to 22(nd) August 2020. All paediatric contacts (13 years) of one hundred adult COVID-19 patients were included. Data of the index cases was taken from the medical records. Paediatric data was collected on the phone using a predesigned proforma. RESULTS: There were 137 paediatric contacts of 100 adult COVID-19 index cases. The index cases were predominantly males (67%) and belonged to the middle socioeconomic class (89%), and 14% succumbed to the disease. Females had more paediatric contacts. The mean age of contacts was 6.6 years, and the majority (80%) developed no symptoms. Among the symptomatic contacts, fever and cough were the most common symptoms. None of the contacts developed dyspnoea or required hospitalization. Majority of the contacts had been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine. Testing for COVID-19 was done in only 77 (56%) contacts, 25 (32%) by the government team, and 52 (67%) privately. A higher number of symptomatic contacts were positive (15/17 (88%)) as compared to that of the asymptomatic contacts (6/60 (10%)) (p = 0.002). Development of symptoms in the contacts was associated with the history of respiratory illnesses, recurrent infections, use of hematinics, a positive COVID-test result, and health professionals being index cases (p  0.01). Parents with higher education and in the health profession and the families of symptomatic contacts reported better compliance with quarantine regulations. CONCLUSION: A significant number of children were exposed to adult COVID-19 patients. Most paediatric contacts remained asymptomatic.

However, due to the emergence and spread of multidrug and single drug resistance mechanisms in H. pylori, as well as serious side effects of currently used antibiotic interventions, achieving successful H. pylori eradication has become exceedingly difficult. Recent studies expressed the intention of seeking novel strategies to improve H. pylori management and reduce the risk of H. pylori-associated intestinal and extragastrointestinal disorders. For which, vitamin supplementation has been demonstrated in many studies to have a tight interaction with H. pylori infection, either directly through the regulation of the host inflammatory pathways or indirectly by promoting the host immune response. On the other hand, H. pylori infection is reported to result in micronutrient malabsorption or deficiency. Furthermore, serum levels of particular micronutrients, especially vitamin D, are inversely correlated to the risk of H. pylori infection and eradication failure. Accordingly, vitamin supplementation might increase the efficiency of H. pylori eradication and reduce the risk of drug-related adverse effects. Therefore, this review aims at highlighting the regulatory role of micronutrients in H. pylori-induced host immune response and their potential capacity, as intrinsic antioxidants, for reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. We also discuss the uncovered mechanisms underlying the molecular and serological interactions between micronutrients and H. pylori infection to present a perspective for innovative in vitro investigations, as well as novel clinical implications.","output":"The Effects of Vitamins and Micronutrients on Helicobacter pylori Pathogenicity, Survival, and Eradication: A Crosstalk between Micronutrients and Immune System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely rapidly spreading respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Many schizophrenic patients were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province. This study took hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 as the research subjects and observed the changes in psychopathology and stress of patients with COVID-19 and the accompanying social isolation. Methods: To sort and isolate potential COVID-19-infected patients, an isolated ward was set up from January 30, 2020, to March 30, 2020. Schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 were referred to this ward, and long-term hospitalized cases were included in this study. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Perceived Stress Scale were used to evaluate the severity of mental symptoms and psychological stress in the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, after the diagnosis of COVID-19 and after recovery. At the time of diagnosis, we also extracted the patient's routine blood, biochemical and other indicators and asked the patient's perception of COVID-19. Results: 21 hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study. The changes in PANSS scores were not significant (p = 0.225 baseline vs. diagnosed, p = 0.399 cured vs. diagnosed). The CPSS scores increased significantly after diagnosis and transfer to the isolation ward (p &lt; 0.001 baseline vs. diagnosed, p &lt; 0.001 cured vs. diagnosed). The course of schizophrenia was a protective factor of stress levels to cases (t = -3.25, p = 0.006), and patients' perception of COVID-19 was a risk factor (t = 2.48, p = 0.038).

This rescue therapy can be performed with moderate conscious sedation (CS) or general anesthesia (GA). The effect of GA on clinical outcome in AIS remains controversial. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated whether the use of CS or GA during endovascular intervention for AIS influenced outcomes. METHODS Patients who underwent emergent endovascular intervention for intracranial arterial occlusion during the years 2006 to 2012 were included in this study. Statistical analysis using the Spearman  was performed to examine demographic data and clinical outcomes between patients in the GA and CS groups. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of mortality. RESULTS A total of 109 patients fit the inclusion criteria. Among them, 35 patients had GA and 74 patients had CS. Patients needing intubation upon admission for airway protection were more likely to receive GA (P<0.001). The duration of the procedure and the time-to-revascularization from symptom onset were significantly longer in the GA group. Mortality was higher in the GA group compared with the CS group (40% vs. 22%, P=0.045). Multivariate analysis, controlled for confounding variables, identified GA and elevated postprocedure glucose level to be significant predictors of mortality.

Objectives: We aimed to determine the clinical course of COVID-19 infection in our patients with SLE and the factors affecting this course Methods: SLE patients (2012 SLICC criteria) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by a positive PCR test and/or typical findings of lung involvement in CT (computed tomography) imaging were included. Data regarding cumulative clinical and laboratory characteristics, histopathology results, autoantibody profiles, immunsuppressives and damage (SLICC damage index/SDI)) were retrieved from the existing database and revised. SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI-2K) was determined at the time of infection. Results: Sixteen SLE patients with COVID-19 infection were identified. Most (87.5%) of these patients were female. Seventy % (n=11) had lupus nephritis. Twenty-five % had thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. PCR was positive in 70% (n=11) of the patients. Pulmonary parenchymal findings compatible with COVID-19 were observed in 56% (n=9) of those patients. Regarding complaints upon admission, 50% (n=8) had fever, 44% (n=7) cough, 44% (n=7) dyspnea, 19% (n=3) myalgia, 12.5% (n=2) headache, 12.5% (n=2) nausea /vomiting, 6% (n=1) diarrhea, and 6 % (n=1) had anosmia. Eight patients were hospitalized. Six of these patients needed oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. None needed a follow-up in the intensive care unit. The mean hospitalization duration was 14  5 (8-25) days. Regarding disease activity at the time of infection, 9 had inactive disease with a SLEDAI-2K score of 0 whilst in 5 patients SLEDA-2K score was 4. The mean SLEDAI-2K score at the time of infection was 1.7  2.3 (0-6). System/ organwise, 1 patient with chronic thrombocytopenia presented with a worsening platelet count accompanied by serologic activity. This patient was a non-adherent to treatment who had stopped taking mycophenolic acid months before COVID19. Three patients 2 of whom had proliferative nephritis experienced nephritic flares.1 patient who had a history of cutaneous lupus and was in remission presented with oral ulcer, leukopenia and hypocomplementemia during infection. Of 16 patients, 7 had system damage at the time of infection. The mean SDI score of the patients was 1.41.8. Comparison of patients with and without damage revealed no significant differences in disease activity, symptoms associated with COVID, in the need for hospitalization, hospitalization duration, and the requirement for oxygen therapy. However,CT findings compatible with COVID19, were more common in patients with damage (87% vs.33%,p=0.04) and their mean CRP levels were higher at diagnosis (65  47 vs.22  48 mg/l;p=0.032). All patients received similar treatment for COVID-19 except active patients who required high dose steroids (2 with active renal, 1 with thrombocytopenia and 1 with oral ulcer, leukopenia and hypocomplementemia).The patient with thrombocytopenia also received intravenous immunoglobulin and 1 with cutaneous active disease received tocilizumab as she developed macrophage activation syndrome. Six patients (37.5%) had received rituximab (RTX) in the last 6 months before COVID. No significant difference, in terms of hospitalization and need for oxygen therapy due to COVID19 was found between patients who had received RTX vs who had not. No hypogammaglobulinemia was detected in patients who received RTX despite lower levels of IgG (998  184 vs 1481 51 mg/dl, p=0.02) Conclusion: Although half of the patients in our series of COVID19 infected SLE patients required hospitalization, there were no mortalities. More patients with damage (none pulmonary) displayed CT findings compatible with COVID19 and further follow up will reveal whether they will suffer from fibrotic lung disease. Patients can experience disease flares during COVID. But it is also important to consider that some manifestations such as thrombocytopenia may also be a sign of severe infection.

Here, we identify and characterize a high-affinity synthetic nanobody (sybody, SR31) as a fusion partner to improve the potency of RBM-antibodies. Crystallographic studies reveal that SR31 binds to RBD at a conserved and 'greasy' site distal to RBM. Although SR31 distorts RBD at the interface, it does not perturb the RBM conformation, hence displaying no neutralizing activities itself.

These sampling periods coincided with times before and during the lockdown in industrial activity and reduced agricultural activity that occurred in the region due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of reduced anthropogenic activity on groundwater quality. Approximately 17% of the wells affected by high fluoride concentrations in the post-monsoon period returned to levels suitable for human consumption in samples collected in the pre-monsoon period. This was probably due to ion exchange processes, infiltration of rainwater during the seasonal monsoon that diluted concentrations of ions including geogenic fluoride, as well as a reduction in anthropogenic inputs during the lockdown. The total hazard index for fluoride in the post-monsoon samples calculated for children, adult women, and adult men indicated that 73%, 60%, and 50% of the groundwater samples, respectively, had fluoride levels higher than the permissible limit. In this study, nitrate pollution declined by 33.4% by the pre-monsoon period relative to the post-monsoon period. The chemical facies of groundwater reverted from the Na-HCO3-Cl and Na-Cl to the Ca-HCO3 type in pre-monsoon samples. Various geogenic indicators like molar ratios, inter-ionic relations along with graphical tools demonstrated that plagioclase mineral weathering, carbonate dissolution, reverse ion exchange, and anthropogenic inputs are influencing the groundwater chemistry of this region. These findings were further supported by the saturation index assessed for the post- and pre-monsoon samples. COVID-19 lockdown considerably reduced groundwater pollution by Na+, K+, Cl-, NO3, and F- ions due to shutdown of industries and reduced agricultural activities. Further groundwater quality improvement during lockdown period there is evidence that the COVID-19 lockdown by increased HCO3 ion concentration.

The titers of the virus increased gradually during serial passage, but the replication capacity decreased in chickens. The virus was partially attenuated at passage 40 (P40) and P70, and was fully attenuated at P110. It lost immunogenicity and kidney tropism at P110 and P70, respectively.

Other substitutions that occurred between P70 and P110, however, were found only in some subpopulations of the virus passages. A 109-bp deletion in the 3-UTR was observed in most subpopulations of P70 and P110, and might be related to virus replication, transcription and pathogenicity.

Patients requiring hospitalization (22% vs. 32.6%) and mechanical ventilation (10% vs. 17.4%) were more in the second wave. The most common symptom was fever (82% and 63%) in both waves. Patchy bilateral opacity was the most common radiological finding. Major complications including lymphocytopenia (36% and 63%), pneumonia (28% and 32.6%), thrombocytopenia (30% and 17.4%), and septic shock (6% and 10.9%) were shared. Ten (20%) patients died in the first wave and 13 (28.3%) in the second wave. Patients aged > 60 years had more severe disease and died more than patients aged < 60 years in both waves. Conclusion: There is a high susceptibility and mortality of HD patients in both the first and second waves of COVID-19 as compared to the general population. Disease symptoms, radiological findings, and laboratory tests were similar in both waves. Patients developing critical disease and requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation were more in the second wave.","output":"A Comparative Study of the First and Second Waves of COVID-19 in Hemodialysis Patients From Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"He may be at pains \\"not to be a zealot\\" (p 61) - I Psychodynamic Interventions i thrums with religious allusions - but Salomonsson clearly seeks to inspire Parent-infant psychotherapy \\"promotes a certain \\"looseness\\" in the analyst's mind\\", Salomonsson argues Bj?rn Salomonsson takes guesswork seriously;the sort of attentive, informed guesswork a parent in ordinary good-enough circumstances might use in deducing and attending to a baby's needs [Extracted from the article] Copyright of British Journal of Psychotherapy is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Psychodynamic Interventions in Pregnancy and Infancy: Clinical and Theoretical Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES People with severe mental illness (SMI) are at extreme risk of being stigmatized and to receive poor quality physical care. It has been demonstrated that they have higher morbidity and poorer prognosis of several medical diseases than the general population, with an at least 10-20-year reduction in life expectancy. METHODS A special issue of Psycho-Oncology focusing on cancer care among patients affected by SMI was called by the Editorial Board of the journal, with the aim to explore cancer health disparities and inequalities among people with SMI, mortality from cancer, problems of communication between multidisciplinary oncology and psychiatric teams and need for more structured intervention (i.e., screening, prevention, treatment). RESULTS Authors from eight countries contributed. The problem of stigma and barriers to cancer care provision for patients with SMI were studied (e.g., the complex nature of SMI and healthcare providers' misunderstanding of SMI). Key barriers were related to both patients, clinicians and institutional problems, such as fragmentation of care. A higher mortality from cancer and poor knowledge about cancer risk-factors was shown in patients with SMI. Models of intervention were also proposed. CONCLUSIONS Several conclusions have been recommended by the authors, such as the need for guidelines and clinical procedures specific for cancer care in mental health settings; large-scale studies to address the disparities of care in people with SMI; a larger vision of psychosocial oncology as the facilitator of the liaison between oncology and psychiatry.","output":"Disparities and inequalities in cancer care and outcomes in patients with severe mental illness: Call to action."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-compassion is a multifaceted construct that represents compassion turned inward and involves approaching ones failure and inadequacy with kindness. To measure these self-compassionate behaviors, the Self-Compassion ScaleShort Form (SCS-SF) is one of the most widely used and has been recurrently employed in the healthcare arena. Specifically, self-compassion has been pointed out as essential for providing compassionate care and maintaining healthcare workers balance. Aim: The aim of this study is twofold: (1) to provide evidence of the psychometric properties of the SCS-SF in a sample of Spanish nurses and (2) to study of its role as a protector of Spanish nurses professional quality of life and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A sample of 115 Spanish nurses was studied. Mean age was 43.79 years old (SD = 10.99);84.3% were women. The factorial structure of the SCS-SF was studied with competitive confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Finally, a full structural equation model was tested, in which positive and negative self-compassion predicted professional quality of life, and professional quality of life, in turn, predicted well-being. Results: Three a priori structures were compared: one-factor, two-factor, and six-factor model. The two-factor solution, positive and negative self-compassion, was retained as the best structure to represent the data. Regarding the predictive model, the two poles of self-compassion predicted professional quality of life prediction, and professional quality of life positively predicted well-being, showing a strong relationship. Conclusion: Self-compassion can be an important resource for nurses balance, promoting adequate professional quality of life and their well-being.","output":"Psychometric Properties of the Self-Compassion ScaleShort Form: Study of Its Role as a Protector of Spanish Nurses Professional Quality of Life and Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite rapid technological advances in healthcare, medicine is still largely practiced in a doctors office one conversation at a time.

Significant variables for NIV success were included in a multivariate analysis. In all, 685 patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1)v viral pneumonia were admitted to participating ICUs; 489 were ventilated, 177 with NIV. The NIV was successful in 72 patients (40.7%), the rest required intubation. Low Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, low Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and absence of renal failure were associated with NIV success. Success of NIV was independently associated with fewer than two chest X-ray quadrant opacities (OR 3.5) and no vasopressor requirement (OR 8.1). However, among patients with two or more quadrant opacities, a SOFA score 7 presented a higher success rate than those with SOFA score >7 (OR 10.7). Patients in whom NIV was successful required shorter ventilation time, shorter ICU stay and hospital stay than NIV failure. In patients in whom NIV failed, the delay in intubation did not increase mortality (26.5% versus 24.2%). Clinicians used NIV in 25.8% of influenza A (H1N1)v viral pneumonia admitted to ICU, and treatment was effective in 40.6% of them.

But a question still remains unanswered: speckle-tracking echocardiography might also be suitable to detect residual myocardial involvement after acute stage of COVID-19? METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 100 patients recovered from COVID-19 with STE to evaluate global (GLS) and segmentar longitudinal strain (LS) and compared with a control group of 100 healthy individuals. STE was performed at a median of 130.35  76.06 days after COVID-19 diagnostic. Demographic and echocardiographic parameters are similar in both groups. Left ventricular ejection faction (LVEF) and GLS were normal in COVID-19 patients (66.20  1.98% and ? 19.51  2.87%, respectively). A reduction in mean LS for the basal segments was found in COVID-19 (16.48  5.41%) when compared to control group (19.09  4.31%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that COVID-19-induced cardiac involvement could persist after recovery of the disease and may be detected by deformation abnormalities using STE.

The isolated metabolites were tested for their antioxidant and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formation, -glucosidase, and lipase inhibitory activities. 1,3,6-Trigalloyl glucose exhibited the highest activity as an antioxidant and AGEs inhibitor as well as an -glucosidase inhibitor. It showed promising binding affinity and stability towards the human intestinal maltase-glucoamylase -glucosidases, as revealed through coupled molecular docking and dynamics studies that could encourage the utilization of this compound in the management of diabetes and its complications. ABSTRACT: Modern life is associated with low physical activity that leads to the accumulation of fats, gaining more weight, and obesity. Accumulation of fat in the abdomen region contributes to diabetes via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Polyphenols are major plant constituents that exert antidiabetic activity through different mechanisms, including radicle scavenging activity, regulation of glucose uptake, and inhibition of fat and polysaccharide hydrolysis in addition to their inhibitory role regarding the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Chemical investigation of C. oblongifolia aerial parts resulted in the isolation of five major compounds: apeginin-7-O--D-glucoside (1), quercetin-3-O--D-glucuronic acid (2), quercetin-3-O--D-galacturonic acid (3), rutin (4), and 1,3,6-trigalloyl glucose (5). The isolated compounds were tested for their antioxidant and AGEs formation, -glucosidase, and lipase inhibitory activities. Compound 5 revealed the highest antioxidant and AGEs inhibitory activity in bovine serum albumin (BSA)-methylglyoxal, BSA-fructose, and arginine-methylglyoxal models. Moreover, it exhibited a potent inhibitory profile on Saccharomyces cerevisiae -glucosidases compared to the positive control, acarbose. Compound (5) further depicted promising binding affinity and stability towards the human intestinal maltase-glucoamylase -glucosidases, which is a diabetes-related therapeutic target, through coupled molecular docking and dynamics studies. The obtained results encourage the usage of 1,3,6-trigalloyl glucose in the management of diabetes and its complications. However, detailed in-vivo studies for this compound should be performed.","output":"Phenolics from Chrozophora oblongifolia Aerial Parts as Inhibitors of -Glucosidases and Advanced Glycation End Products: In-Vitro Assessment, Molecular Docking and Dynamics Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several lifestyle-related factors, such as obesity and diabetes, have been identified as risk factors for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality. The objective of this study was to examine the global association between lifestyle-related factors and COVID-19 mortality using data from each individual country. METHODS: The association between prevalence of seven lifestyle-related factors (overweight, insufficient physical activity, smoking, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and age over 65) and COVID-19 mortality was assessed by linear and multivariable regression among 186 countries. The cumulative effect of lifestyle-related factors on COVID-19 mortality was assessed by dividing countries into four categories according to the number of lifestyle-related factors in the upper half range and comparing the mean mortality between groups. RESULTS: In linear regression, COVID-19 mortality was significantly associated with overweight, insufficient physical activity, hyperlipidaemia, and age 65. In multivariable regression, overweight and age 65 demonstrated significant association with COVID-19 mortality (p = .0039, .0094). Countries with more risk factors demonstrated greater COVID-19 mortality (P for trend <.001). CONCLUSION: Lifestyle-related factors, especially overweight and elderly population, were associated with increased COVID-19 mortality on a global scale.

However, the many epitopes generated by infection have not been fully investigated with only a few epitopes known and these being mostly limited to the S protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain which limits vaccine and drug design 1-4. The difference between epitopes generated by infection and vaccination has also not been studied. To address this, we employed a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to screen for linear epitopes recognized by antibodies present in COVID-19 patients and individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine. The proteome microarray consisted of S, N, and E proteins, as well as spotting peptides that were 15 amino acids in length with overlaps of 5-amino acids, covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome (MN908947.3) (Figure 1). Blood samples were incubated onto the arrays followed by an incubation of fluorescent secondary anti-human antibodies. Fluorescent intensity data generated and normalized using the Z-score method and then further analyzed for significance by parametric one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test (COVID-19 cohort) and repeated measure ANOVAs with Dunnett's post hoc tests (vaccinated cohort). The full-length S protein showed a significant increase in COVID-19 patients at around 20-23 days after symptom onset and vaccinated individuals over all time points in both IgM and IgG antibodies (Figure 2A). Linear mapping of the IgM epitopes revealed a degree of overlap between infected and vaccinated individuals (22.2%; 6/27 total) with both having epitopes in the RBD and fusion peptide (FP) (Figure 2B). Structural mapping on 3D models of the S protein showed that all epitopes where on the surface of the protein and that COVID-19 generated epitopes have a different pattern than those generated by vaccination (Figure 2C). An Epitope identified in this study with future prospects is epitope S481-495 from COIVD-19 patients that partially overlapped the binding site of two neutralizing antibodies previously isolated from COVID-19 patients, S2H135 and F2B-2F61, and contacted amino acids that interact with ACE2 receptor6,7. One epitope of note from the vaccinated individuals is epitope S811-825 which mapped adjacent to the fusion-peptide proximal region. These epitopes may be helpful in future vaccine and antibody therapy development. 1 Ju, B. et al. Nature 584, 115-119. 2 Robbiani, D. F. et al.

Establishing the acceptance of vaccines among healthcare workers, who play a vital role immunization program success, is important. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of social trust and demographic factors on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers. Methods A cross-sectional survey utilizing an electronic questionnaire inquiring about COVID-19 vaccine uptake, preferences, and concerns was distributed via email to 1,351 North Central Regional Health Authority (NCRHA) healthcare workers of the following categories: medical practitioners, nursing personnel, veterinary surgeons, medical interns, dental interns, paramedics, and pharmacists. These professions were selected as they were granted power to administer COVID-19 vaccines during this period of public emergency by the President of Trinidad and Tobago and were therefore likely to be NCRHA healthcare workers directly involved in vaccine administration services. 584 participants returned a completed questionnaire. Bivariate analysis using Chi-square analysis of association was used to determine the association between the respondents characteristics and the acceptance of the vaccine and the association between vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers and trust. The association between the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and healthcare workers characteristics and trust was established using multinomial logistic regression. Results A total of 584 healthcare workers took part in the study and 1.4% showed unwillingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. The study indicates that age, profession, and the trust in international organizations and other healthcare providers predict the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare workers.

Black fungus is caused by getting into exposure with fungus spores in the surroundings. It can also form in the skin after the fungus enters through a cut, scrape, burn, or another type of skin trauma. Fungi live in the environment, particularly in soil and decaying organic matter such as leaves, compost piles, rotten wood, particularly in soil, compost, and animal dung. This fungal infection is caused by a type of mould known as 'mucromycetes. It should be noted that this rare fungal infection affects persons who have health issues or who use drugs that weaken the body's ability to fight the infections. There are different types of mucormycosis Trusted Source, including rhino cerebral (sinus and brain), pulmonary (lung), gastrointestinal, and cutaneous (skin) mucormycosis. The COVID-19 generates a sudden change in the interior environment of the host for the fungus, and the medical treatment administered unknowingly promotes fungal development. COVID-19 causes harm to the airway mucosa and blood vessels. It also causes a rise in serum iron, which is required for the fungus to grow. Broad-spectrum antibiotics not only kill potentially harmful bacteria but also beneficial commensals. Although antifungals such as Voriconazole prevent Aspergillosis, Mucor survives and grows due to a lack of resistance. Long-term ventilation decreases immunity, and there is conjecture that the humidifier water that is delivered along with the oxygen transfers the fungus. It is ubiquitous and found in soil and air and even in the nose and mucus of healthy people. It affects the sinuses, the brain and the lungs and can be life-threatening in diabetic or severely immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients or people with HIV/AIDS. Doctors believe mucormycosis, which has an overall mortality rate of 50%, may be being triggered by the use of steroids, a life-saving treatment for severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients. Steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs for Covid-19 and appear to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive to fight off coronavirus. But they also reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetics and non-diabetic Covid-19 patients.

The rate of infection is persistently rising which has forced many authorities to promote stay at home orders. Individuals may experience an increase in anxiety due to spending longer durations at home, working from home, lacking direct social interactions with friends and family, monetary losses, and potentially getting infected from the virus. Increased anxiety for prolonged periods is linked to elevated blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes. To evaluate the influence of the pandemic on psychological health, we conducted a study on effects of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) and stress management education (SME). To analyze the effects of the pandemic on mental health of our participants, we compared a group which was not affected by the pandemic (NPG) to a group that was affected by the pandemic (PG). The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of 8\\\\weeks active intervention of MBSR and SME in NPG and PG on state\\\\trait anxiety and decentering. 36 adults participated in the study. All the participants were randomly enrolled in either 8\\\\weeks of MBSR or SME training. The NPG had 19 participants with 10 in MBSR and 9 in the SME group. The PG had 17 participants with 8 in MBSR and 9 in SME group. The MBSR group had weekly group sessions of ~2.5h on body scanning, meditation and light yoga while the SME group had concurrent sessions on nutrition, sleep, and stress management. Both the groups also did home practice daily for ~45 minutes. The NPG met in person for each of the 8 weeks, but the PG completed the last 4\\\\weeks of the course online due to a stay\\\\at\\\\home mandate at the time in Michigan. All the participants filled out a questionnaire on state anxiety, trait anxiety and decentering before and after the 8\\\\weeks. A ReANOVA was used to compare the differences across the 8 weeks, with condition (PG vs. NPG) as a between\\\\subjects factor. The results showed that there was a significant increase in decentering in PG after the 8\\\\weeks (treatment x condition and time x condition both p<0.03). The SME participants (5.61.5 a.u., p=0.007) and MBSR participants (3.50.7 a.u., p=0.002) significantly improved their ability to decenter during the pandemic. State anxiety did not change across the 8\\\\weeks of SME or MBSR in either the NPG or PG. Trait anxiety was reduced across the 8\\\\week intervention groups (time p=0.043) with MBSR participants decreasing by (3.42.8 a.u.) and SME participants decreasing by (0.91.7 a.u.). In this small cohort of adults, the 8\\\\week MBSR and SME interventions helped to reduce trait anxiety, and significantly improved the ability to decenter (disconnect from emotions) during the global pandemic. In addition, there was not an increase in state\\\\anxiety during the pandemic, which may be at least partially due to active participation in MBSR and SME.

Exclusion criteria for patients was: other axis-I and axis-II diagnoses, intensive psychotherapy or electroconvulsive therapy, prior clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, alcohol or nicotine dependence, pregnancy, hormone supplement therapy, somatic illnesses (diabetes, renal or hepatic disorders), infections or autoimmune diseases, recent surgical treatment or significantly changed body weight. For controls: the presence of psychiatric disorders and/or thyroid dysfunctions. The diagnosis of major depression was made using structured clinical interview based on DSM-IV criteria. The results showed significantly lower T3 and TSH levels in patients compared to controls. There was no significant difference in T4 values between patients with depression and control subjects. The results showing altered levels of thyroid hormones in depression indicate that further research on thyroid hormone activity can contribute to the better understanding of the biological basis of depression. Based on the high frequency of the subtle neuroendocrine disorders coexisting with depression, the association of thyroid abnormalities and depression should not be underestimated. Future research should identify different behavioral endophenotypes characteristic for depression, which would greatly facilitate delineating the biological phenomena associated with this psychiatric illness.","output":"Thyroid activity in patients with major depression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent research demonstrates that transfusing whole blood (WB=red blood cells (RBC)+plasma+platelets) rather than just RBC (which is current National Health Service (NHS) practice) may improve outcomes for major trauma patients. As part of a programme to investigate provision of WB, NHS Blood and Transplant undertook a 2-year feasibility study to supply the Royal London Hospital (RLH) with (group O negative, O neg) leucodepleted red cell and plasma (LD-RCP) for transfusion of trauma patients with major haemorrhage in prehospital settings. Incidents requiring such prehospital transfusion occur randomly, with very high variation. Availability is critical, but O neg LD-RCP is a scarce resource and has a limited shelf life (14 days) after which it must be disposed of. The consequences of wastage are the opportunity cost of loss of overall treatment capacity across the NHS and reputational damage. The context was this feasibility study, set up to assess deliverability to RLH and subsequent wastage levels. Within this, we conducted a quality improvement project, which aimed to reduce the wastage of LD-RCP to no more than 8% (ie, 1 of the 12 units delivered per week). Over this 2-year period, we reduced wastage from a weekly average of 70%C27%. This was achieved over four improvement cycles. The largest improvement came from moving near-expiry LD-RCP to the emergency department (ED) for use with their trauma patients, with subsequent improvements from embedding use in ED as routine practice, introducing a dedicated LD-RCP delivery schedule (which increased the units 2 days old at delivery from 42% to 83%) and aligning this delivery schedule to cover two cycles of peak demand (Fridays and Saturdays).","output":"Making every drop count: reducing wastage of a novel blood component for transfusion of trauma patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study seeks to examine and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of COVID-19 outbreaks and identify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and changing trends of cases.

The main findings are as follows. 1) The outbreak had spread rapidly throughout the country within a short time and the current totality incidence rate has decreased. 2) The spatiotemporal distribution of cases was uneven. In terms of the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, Wuhan and Shiyan city were the center as both cities had high-high clustering pattern with a surrounding unstable multiple type pattern in partial areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and Chongqing city.

In this interpretive scheme, which is so central to public policies in many countries around the world, and also in Brazil, any and all harm that affects human populations involves, to some extent, biological aspects, but the main determinants of illness and death of populations are seen as primarily linked to ethnic, political and socioeconomic inequalities.

Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 experience a variety of symptoms, including fever, muscle pain, tiredness, cough, and difficulty breathing. Elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms and have a higher risk of physical deconditioning during their hospital stay. Physical therapists have an important role in supporting hospitalized patients with COVID-19 but also need to be aware of challenges when treating these patients. In line with international initiatives, this article aims to provide guidance and detailed recommendations for hospital-based physical therapists managing patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through a national approach in the Netherlands. METHODS: A pragmatic approach was used. A working group conducted a purposive scan of the literature and drafted initial recommendations based on the knowledge of symptoms in patients with COVID-19, and current practice for physical therapist management for patients hospitalized with lung disease and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). An expert group of hospital-based physical therapists in the Netherlands provided feedback on the recommendations, which were finalized when consensus was reached among the members of the working group. RESULTS: The recommendations include safety recommendations, treatment recommendations, discharge recommendations, and staffing recommendations. Treatment recommendations address 2 phases of hospitalization: when patients are critically ill and admitted to the ICU, and when patients are severely ill and admitted to the COVID ward. Physical therapist management for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 comprises elements of respiratory support and active mobilization. Respiratory support includes breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, airway clearance techniques, and respiratory muscle strength training. Recommendations toward active mobilization include bed mobility activities, active range-of-motion exercises, active (?assisted) limb exercises, activities-of-daily-living training, transfer training, cycle ergometer, pre-gait exercises, and ambulation.","output":"Recommendations for Hospital-Based Physical Therapists Managing Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy is associated with a higher risk for severe morbidity and mortality when compared with infection in non-pregnant women of childbearing age.

The Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) is a 5-item mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief during the pandemic. Objective: The PGS has strong psychometric and diagnostic features. The objective was to examine the incremental validity of the PGS in identifying mourners at risk of harmful outcomes. Design: A cross-sectional survey design involving sociodemographic questions and self-report measures of pandemic grief, generalized anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, separation distress, functional impairment, meaning-making difficulties, and substance use coping. Setting/Subjects: A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (N = 1065) in the United States. Results: Fully 56.6% of participants scored above the cut score of 7 on the PGS for clinically dysfunctional pandemic grief and 69.7% coped with their loss using drugs or alcohol for at least several days in past two weeks. PGS scores were not associated with time since loss. Hierarchical multiple regression models demonstrated that the PGS uniquely explained variance in functional impairment, meaning-making difficulties, and substance use coping, over relevant background factors, bereavement-related psychopathology, and separation distress. In the final model, the standardized regression coefficients for the PGS were 2-15 times larger than for the other competing measures in explaining each of the three outcomes.

The current pandemic has aggravated preexisting prejudices and shed light on long-standing social, economic, and health inequities that have been and continue to be perpetuated by systems of oppression. Psychologists are in a unique position to collaboratively work with marginalized individuals navigating pandemic threat, discrimination, and oppressive systems. This paper presents best practice recommendations for U.S.-based psychologists working with marginalized populations impacted by COVID-19. Psychologists are encouraged to synchronously develop the following three areas of evidence-based practice, as they relate to the impacts of COVID-19: (a) self-reflection and self-awareness in a COVID-19 context (i.e., reflecting on one's identities and one's knowledge and attitudes toward sociohistorical inequities), (b) knowledge acquisition (i.e., adopting an attitude of cultural humility, identifying \\"emotional contagion,\\" identifying impacts of systemic injustice that may be compounded by COVID-19, and recognizing racial trauma in clients of color), and (c) collaboration with clients (i.e., identify the mental health toll of oppressive systems, explore COVID-19 relevant and culturally responsive methods of healing, encourage virtual community engagement, and incorporate ethnic and racial identity development in personal and professional work). Engaging with these best practice recommendations should result in the psychologist's improved ability to identify and address the consequences of systemic oppression that have been highlighted and exacerbated by COVID-19 on their own behavior and their clients' mental health. Furthermore, psychologists engaged with these best practice recommendations should find themselves better prepared to utilize culturally responsive interventions despite barriers created by COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study included a nonvalidated telephone survey designed in April and May of 2020 and a retrospective medical record review conducted in parallel with survey administration from May 22 to August 18, 2020. Participants were recruited from 2 tertiary eye care centers (Emory Eye Center in Atlanta, Georgia, and W.K. Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan). The study included a random sample of patients with diagnoses of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic retinopathy (DR) who received an intravitreal injection between January 6 and March 13, 2020, and were scheduled for a second injection between March 13 and May 6, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Association between perceptions regarding COVID-19 risks and loss to follow-up. Results Of 1004 eligible patients, 423 (42%) were successfully contacted, and 348 (82%) agreed to participate (participants' mean [SD] age, 75 [12] years; 195 women [56%]; 287 White [82%] patients).

Of all respondents, 163 (47%) were very concerned or moderately concerned about vision loss from missed treatments during the pandemic. Although 208 (60%) believed the COVID-19 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exposure at the eye clinic was extremely unlikely or unlikely, 49 (14%) believed it was extremely likely or likely. Seventy-eight participants (22%) were lost to follow-up. Concern regarding COVID-19 exposure during clinic visits (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% CI, 1.8-8.4) and diagnosis of DR (vs AMD) (OR, 8.130; 95% CI, 3.367-20.408) were associated with an increase in likelihood of loss to follow-up.

We compared the sodium excretion and BP relationships from m-24hUNa versus formula-estimated sodium excretions, using restricted cubic spline plots for adjusted multilevel linear models. All formulas overestimated 24-hour sodium at lower levels but underestimated 24-hour sodium at higher levels. There was a linear relationship between m-24hUNa excretion and systolic BP, while estimated sodium excretion from all 3 formulas had a J-shaped relationship with systolic BP. The relationships between urine sodium excretion and diastolic BP were more complex but were also altered by using formulas. All formulas had associations with BP when a sex-specific constant sodium concentration was inserted in place of measured sodium. Since we used the m-24hUNa, potassium, and creatinine concentrations in formulas, the J-shaped relationships are due to intrinsic problems in the formulas, not due to spot urine sampling.

The majority of the identified patients with treatment restrictions had risk factors associated with fatal COVID-19 outcome. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of a negative impact of anti-cancer therapies on COVID-19 outcome. Timely end-of-life communication as part of advanced care planning could save patients from prolonged suffering and decrease burden in intensive care units. Early discussion of treatment restrictions should therefore be part of routine oncological care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Life-prolonging treatment restrictions and outcome in patients with cancer and COVID-19: an update from the Dutch Oncology COVID-19 Consortium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technical assistance is provided to strengthen state capability as part of international development programmes.

Relative frequencies and associations with vaping behavior are unknown. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the frequencies of imaging findings and CT patterns in EVALI and what is the relationship to vaping behavior? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: CT scans of 160 subjects with EVALI from 15 institutions were retrospectively reviewed. CT findings and patterns were defined and agreed on via consensus. The parenchymal organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern was defined as regional or diffuse ground-glass opacity (GGO)  consolidation without centrilobular nodules (CNs). An airway-centered OP pattern was defined as diffuse CNs with little or no GGO, whereas a mixed OP pattern was a combination of the two. Other patterns included diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), acute eosinophilic-like pneumonia, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Cases were classified as atypical if they did not fit into a pattern. Imaging findings, pattern frequencies, and injury severity were correlated with substance vaped (marijuana derives [tetrahydrocannabinol] [THC] only, nicotine derivates only, and both), vaping frequency, regional geography, and state recreational THC legality. One-way analysis of variance, (2) test, and multivariable analyses were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients (79.4% men) with a mean age of 28.2 years (range, 15-68 years) with EVALI underwent CT scan. Seventy-seven (48.1%), 15 (9.4%), and 68 (42.5%) patients admitted to vaping THC, nicotine, or both, respectively. Common findings included diffuse or lower lobe GGO with subpleural (78.1%), lobular (59.4%), or peribronchovascular (PBV) sparing (40%). Septal thickening (50.6%), lymphadenopathy (63.1%), and CNs (36.3%) were common. PBV sparing was associated with younger age (P = .02). Of 160 subjects, 156 (97.5%) had one of six defined patterns. Parenchymal, airway-centered, and mixed OP patterns were seen in 89 (55.6%), 14 (8.8%), and 32 (20%) patients, respectively. Acute eosinophilic-like pneumonia (six of 160, 3.8%), DAD (nine of 160, 5.6%), pulmonary hemorrhage (six of 160, 3.8%), and atypical (four of 160, 2.5%) patterns were less common. Increased vaping frequency was associated with more severe injury (P = .008). Multivariable analysis showed a negative association between vaping for > 6 months and DAD pattern (P = .03). Two subjects (1.25%) with DAD pattern died. There was no relation between pattern and injury severity, geographic location, and state legality of recreational use of THC. INTERPRETATION: EVALI typically causes an OP pattern but exists on a spectrum of acute lung injury. Vaping habits do not correlate with CT patterns except for negative correlation between vaping > 6 months and DAD pattern. PBV sparing, not previously described in acute lung injury, is a common finding.","output":"CT Findings and Patterns of e-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury: A Multicenter Cohort of 160 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus Corona Disease (COVID-19) telah melanda sejumlah besar negara dan hal ini berdampak pada beberapa sektor antara lain menyebabkan permasalahan di bidang kesehatan ekonomi sosial pendidikan dan komunikasi.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of postpartum depression and its predictors among postnatal women in Lagos. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 250 mothers in Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria, attending six Primary Health Care centers for infant immunization at six weeks post-delivery. Data was collected using a pretested semi-structured interviewer administered questionnaire which included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Analysis was carried out using SPSS version 23TM. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to determine associations and predictive relationships between various factors and the presence of postpartum depression. The level of significance was set at <0.05. Results: The prevalence of postpartum depression was 35.6%. Multiparity, delivery by cesarean section, mother being unwell after delivery, and not exclusively breastfeeding the baby were the factors linked with postpartum depression. Following multiple logistic regression, having postpartum blues (p=0.000; OR=32.77; 95%CI=7.23-148.58)., not getting help with caring for the baby (p=0.008; OR=2.64; 95%CI=1.29-5.42), experiencing intimate partner violence (p=0.000; OR=5.2; 95%CI=2.23-11.91) and having an unsupportive partner (p=0.018; OR=2.6; 95%CI=1.17-5.78) were identified as predictors of postpartum depression.

Complications may represent different manifestation of a profound endothelial dysfunction and injury. Biopsies reveal macro and microvascular thrombosis involving larger and smaller vessels. Different Authors described accumulation of inflammatory cells across vascular bed, viral inclusions and apoptotic bodies across vascular bed. Endotheliitis leads to loss of vessel integrity with bleedings and lumen restriction with tissue ischemia and necrosis. SARS-CoV-2 also can cause vasculitis and a systemic inflammatory vascular disease with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Several cases of vasculitis have been described during COVID-19 pandemy but in literature, to our knowledge, there are few cases of patients developing vasculitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD: A 59-year-old male patient in chronic haemodialysis with hypertension, chronic thrombocytopenia, uncertain history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and recent COVID-19 pneumonia (1 month before) was admitted to our E.R. with psycho-motor slowdown, dyspnoea, profound hypotension, diffuse and extensive purpura especially on extremities and nose with petechiae and ecchymoses, thrombocytopenia, widespread arthritis and myalgia and atrial fibrillation with high ventricular response. Laboratory tests revealed leucocytosis with elevation of inflammatory markers (GB 15.6 x 10(3)/L CRP 6.61 mg/dl, procalcitonin 2.64 ng/ml), thrombocytopenia (PLTs 55 x 10(3)/L), Hb 11.2 g/dl, increased amylase (444 UI/L) and lipase (608 UI/L), hyperkaliaemic metabolic acidosis, mild impaired blood clotting with normal fibrinogen and severe D-Dimer elevation (3453 mcg/ml), normal haptoglobin and bilirubin. SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test and three molecular swab tests (at admission and during recovery) were negative. Contrast-enhanced chest-abdomen CT did not demonstrate relevant findings. RESULTS: We suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, COVID-19 related vasculitis or an autoimmune disease reactivation after SARS-CoV-2 or other concurrent viral infections. A peripheral blood smear excluded presence of schistocytes, HBV, HCV, HIV, c-ANCA, p-ANCA, LAC anti-mitochondrial and ENA antibodies were negative, such as complement factor C4 (C3 at low limits). IgA immunoglobulins resulted increased (952 mg/dl). We administered intravenous (IV) hydration, analgesic therapy, broad spectrum antibiotics and Methylprednisolone 40 mg IV without benefit. Three days after clinical conditions were critical with further neurological deterioration and haemodynamic instability, consequently we started methylprednisolone 1 g/day IV for three days, followed by oral prednisone 25 mg/die with rapid improvement of clinical conditions and laboratory findings. A skin biopsy revealed a variable and discontinuous presence of C4d and IgM along capillary walls and traces of IgG, supporting the hypothesis of an immune-mediated vasculitic process. Patient was discharged in stable condition with Prednisone 25 mg/die per os. Later we learned that patient had been hospitalized again for severe anaemia, thrombocytopenia and septic shock with fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 clinical spectrum appears to be extremely varied; the direct cytolysis and the immune-mediated damage are among the most accredited hypotheses on disease physiopathology, but molecular mimicry mechanisms may also be involved. Vascular endothelium can be considered among the first targets. Vasculitis are frequently described in literature during COVID, this case, instead, is an anecdotal report of severe angiitis arising after swab negativization, underlying the possibility that hyperinflammation can either cause an autoimmune syndrome de novo or trigger a flare-up of a pre-existing condition.","output":"MO240 A FATAL CASE OF VASCULITIS AFTER SARS-COV-2 NEGATIVIZATION"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To combat the enduring and dangerous spread of COVID-19, many innovations to rapid diagnostics have been developed based on proteinprotein interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins to increase testing accessibility.

Those with severe disease are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) but with poor outcomes. Concomitant right ventricular assist device (RVAD) may be beneficial. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of intensive care unit patients admitted with COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) was performed. Nonintubated patients, those with acute kidney injury, and age > 75 were excluded. Patients who underwent RVAD/ECMO support were compared with those managed via invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) alone. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-d mortality, acute kidney injury, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 received IMV, and 18 received RVAD/ECMO. In-hospital (52.4 versus 11.1%, P = 0.008) and 30-d mortality (42.9 versus 5.6%, P= 0.011) were significantly lower in patients treated with RVAD/ECMO. Acute kidney injury occurred in 15 (71.4%) patients in the IMV group and zero RVAD/ECMO patients (P< 0.001). ICU (11.5 versus 21 d, P= 0.067) and hospital (14 versus 25.5 d, P = 0.054) length of stay were not significantly different. There were no RVAD/ECMO device complications.

Recent studies reveal that companion animals are organisms susceptible to being infected by this pathogen due to the close contact they have with their owners. For this reason, the aim of the present work was to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in dogs and cats in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, where there is active transmission of this microorganism in human populations. Oral and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from dogs and cats with a history of exposure to patients with COVID-19. Total RNA was extracted and detection of viral genes N1 and N2 was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). All 130 samples of companion animals tested by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 were negative at the time they were collected. This study represents the second active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in populations of domestic dogs and cats in Latin America and the first approach in Mexico. Given that coronaviruses have shown a high capacity to be transmitted between species, it is imperative to establish measures to prevent this agent from entering and establishing in populations of companion animals.","output":"No molecular evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in companion animals from Veracruz, Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the problem of learning undirected graphical models under Laplacian structural constraints from the point of view of financial market data.

In September 2018, a high positive rate of human adenovirus HAdV was occurred among hospitalized children in the Childrens Hospital Affiliated to the Capital Institute of Paediatrics in Beijing. To investigate whether this outbreak of HAdV was related to nosocomial infections or the result of community infections, we collected respiratory specimens from patients with acute respiratory infections in a respiratory ward during June to December 2018, and screened for respiratory viruses. Among 1,840 cases included, 95 (5.2%, 95/1840) were positive for HAdV and 81 were genotyped based on phylogenetic analysis, including seven as HAdV-1 (8.6%), 30 HAdV-3 (37.0%), two HAdV-6 (2.5%), and 42 HAdV-7 (51.9%). More HAdV-positive samples were collected in August (4.7%, 12/255), September (15.0%, 41/274) and October (6.9%, 17/247), with a peak in September 2018. By combining the results of HAdV phylogenetic analysis with clinical data of patients, there were 77 cases (4.2%, 77/1840; 81.1%, 77/95) excluded from nosocomial infections, eight cases representing possible infections transmitted by visitors or attending parents, three cases without sequences that might have been due to infection transmitted by roommates positive for HAdV, one case of a roommate without an HAdV sequence, and six cases that shared highly homologous sequences with those of their roommates, for which nosocomial infections might be considered. In conclusion, genotyping of HAdVs based on phylogenetic analysis combined with clinical information provides a powerful method to distinguish nosocomial infections from community acquired infection, especially when tracing the origins of nosocomial infections.

This disease attacks the respiratory system and comes with a number of symptoms. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention presents a set of symptoms. However, these symptoms only begin to manifest after a number of days, which prevents early detection of this disease. This absence of symptoms during the early stages is what is considered by many to be the very factor that caused the virus into becoming a pandemic. Nonetheless, symptoms checking has been used in practice by commercial and business establishments as an initial screening for COVID-19. The bothersome process of symptom checking are still in place at the entrances of malls and airports. In this study, we determine whether or not symptom screening is an effective system to be employed to assess individuals for COVID-19. Specifically, it aims to determine whether or not one or a set of symptoms are effective predictors of the RT-PCR test results, the gold standard in Covid-19 testing, using machine learning. Using data from the Philippine Red Cross, classification models are developed using LightGBM, AdaBoost, Gaussian Na?ve-Bayes, MultiLayer Perceptron, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Decision Tree. These models were evaluated using the following metrics: precision, sensitivity, specificity and the type II error rate. Furthermore, for explainability, symptoms are analyzed as to whether or not they are relatively influential on the predicting whether or not a patient has COVID-19. The high type II error rate, low sensitivity and low relative predictor scores of the most significant predictor symptoms clearly show that symptoms do not correlate with the RT-PCR testing results. Thus, we conclude that symptom screening is not a medically suitable process for determining whether an individual has COVID-19.

During the pandemic, interventions recommended globally for people with diabetes were to keep blood glucose on target whilst staying at home to curb the spread of the virus. In Brazil, similar measures were proposed. The aim of our observational study was to assess whether these measures achieved their objectives. METHODS: An anonymous and untraceable survey was shared from April 22nd to May 4th. States with more than 30 respondents were included in the analysis and Fisher's exact test was performed to identify associations, with p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Type 1 diabetes and female participants were prevalent, 60.76% and 76.12% respectively. 10 out of 26 states were included, in addition to the Federal District (1562 responses). Only in three states (Bahia, Gois and Pernambuco) less than 50% of the respondents experienced higher glycemia or higher variability during the pandemic. Gois state, where almost half of the respondents (49.12%) have private insurance, presented the highest percentage of individuals receiving medicines for three months (35.48%) and one of the lowest percentages of blood glucose deterioration (47.17%). In the large states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and S?o Paulo, consultations and/or lab exams were postponed by 37.14%, 34.33% and 40.88%, respectively.

Distinctively, a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients develop olfactory dysfunction of uncertain underlying mechanism which can be severe and prolonged. The roles of inflammatory obstruction of the olfactory clefts leading to conductive impairment, inflammatory cytokines affecting olfactory neuronal function, destruction of olfactory neurons or their supporting cells, and direct invasion of olfactory bulbs, in causing olfactory dysfunction are uncertain. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the location for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 from the olfactory epithelium (OE) of the nasopharynx to the olfactory bulb of golden Syrian hamsters. RESULTS: After intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses were detected in the nasal turbinate tissues which peaked between 2 to 4 days post-infection with the highest viral load detected at day 2 post-infection. Besides the nasopharyngeal pseudo-columnar ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens were also detected in the more superficial mature olfactory sensory neurons labeled by olfactory marker protein (OMP), the less mature olfactory neurons labelled by Tuj1 at more basal position, and the sustentacular cells which provide metabolic and physical support for the olfactory neurons, resulting in apoptosis and severe destruction of the OE. During the whole course of infection, SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens were not detected in the olfactory bulb. CONCLUSIONS: Besides acute inflammation at OE, infection of mature and immature olfactory neurons, and the supporting sustentacular cells by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the unique olfactory dysfunction of COVID-19 which is not reported with SARS-CoV.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infects and damages the mature and immature olfactory sensory neurons of hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning in March 2020, the United States emerged as the global epicenter for COVID-19 cases with little to guide policy response in the absence of extensive data available for reliable epidemiological modeling in the early phases of the pandemic. In the ensuing weeks, American jurisdictions attempted to manage disease spread on a regional basis using non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., social distancing), as uneven disease burden across the expansive geography of the United States exerted different implications for policy management in different regions. While Arizona policymakers relied initially on state-by-state national modeling projections from different groups outside of the state, we sought to create a state-specific model using a mathematical framework that ties disease surveillance with the future burden on Arizona's healthcare system. Our framework uses a compartmental system dynamics model using a SEIRD framework that accounts for multiple types of disease manifestations for the COVID-19 infection, as well as the observed time delay in epidemiological findings following public policy enactments. We use a compartment initialization logic coupled with a fitting technique to construct projections for key metrics to guide public health policy, including exposures, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths under a variety of social reopening scenarios.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Fifty-three adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients (according to ICU Confusion Assessment Method scores) who were treated for delirium received quetiapine and Neurogol syrup (a combination of valerian and lemon balm) or placebo 5 mL every 12 hours for five consecutive days. Improvement in agitation according to the Richmond Sedation and Restlessness Scale was considered the main outcome. RESULTS: The trial was completed for 53 patients (27 in the treatment group and 26 in the placebo group). The baseline characteristics between the groups were similar. In the treatment group, the number of agitated patients was significantly reduced and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.000). Compared with the placebo group, the length of ICU stay in the treatment group was significantly reduced (p = 0.001). The Glasgow Coma Scale improved significantly at the end of day 5 (p = 0.04). There was no statistical difference in the improvement of delirium between the study groups (p = 0.14). Neurogol syrup was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The addition of Neurogol to quetiapine (a combination of valerian and lemon balm) can reduce agitation and shorten the length of stay in the ICU without adverse effects.

METHODS We queried the 2002-2016 National Inpatient Sample database for hospitalized patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. We report temporal trends, predictors, and outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting in the early (2002-2010) and recent (2011-2016) cohorts. RESULTS Of 3,347,470 patients hospitalized for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 7.7% underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. The incidence of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting after ST-elevation myocardial infarction decreased over time (9.2% in 2002 vs 5.5% in 2016, Ptrend < .001), whereas perioperative crude in-hospital mortality did not change (5.1% in 2002 vs 4.2% in 2016, Ptrend = .66), coinciding with an increase in the burden of comorbidities. There was an increase in performing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on hospitalization day 3 or more, as well as an increase in the use of mechanical support devices and precoronary artery bypass grafting percutaneous coronary intervention. In the early cohort, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on days 1 and 2 was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. In the recent cohort, coronary artery bypass grafting on day 2 had similar in-hospital mortality compared with day 3 or more and lower rates of acute kidney injury, ischemic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS In this nationwide analysis, there has been a decline in the use of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting after ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on day 1 was performed in sicker patients and was associated with higher in-hospital mortality than coronary artery bypass grafting performed on day 3 or more.

This is due to the availability of new molecular and experimental tools. Circumstantial evidence points towards a potentially causative role as well as to possibly protective effects of certain respiratory viruses in the cause of allergic asthma during early childhood. In addition, it now has become clear that exacerbations of asthma, in children as well as adults, are mostly associated with respiratory virus infections, with a predominant role of the common cold virus: rhinovirus. Careful human in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that rhinovirus can potentially stimulate bronchial epithelial cells to produce pro\\\\inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, may activate cholinergic\\\\ or noncholinergic nerves, increase epithelial\\\\derived nitric oxide synthesis, upregulate local ICAM\\\\1 expression, and can lead to nonspecific T\\\\cell responses and/or virus\\\\specific T\\\\cell proliferation. Experimental rhinovirus infections in patients with asthma demonstrate features of exacerbation, such as lower airway symptoms, variable airways obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the latter being associated with eosinophil counts and eosinophilic cationic protein levels in induced sputum. This suggests that multiple cellular pathways can be involved in rhinovirus\\\\induced asthma exacerbations.

Recent studies have found that loneliness and living in isolation are likely to cause an acceleration in the cognitive decline associated with AD. Therefore, understanding social behaviours of AD patients is crucial to promote sociability, thus delaying cognitive decline, preserving independence, and providing a good quality of life. In this work, we analyze the localization data of AD patients living in assisted care homes to gather insights about the social dynamics among them. We use localization data collected by a system based on iBeacon technology comprising two components: a network of antennas scattered throughout the facility and a Bluetooth bracelet worn by the patients. We redefine the Relational Index to capture wandering and casual encounters, these being common phenomena among AD patients, and use the notions of Relational and Popularity Indexes to model, visualize and understand the social behaviour of AD patients. We leverage the data analyses to build predictive tools and applications to enhance social activities scheduling and sociability monitoring and promotion, with the ultimate aim of providing patients with a better quality of life. Predictions and visualizations act as a support for caregivers in activity planning to maximize treatment effects and, hence, slow down the progression of Alzheimers disease.

Using Wavelet coherence analysis and spillover index methodologies in bivariate and multivariate settings, this study examines the correlation of these assets for different investment horizons. The findings suggest that gold, oil and Bitcoin exhibited low coherency with each stock index across almost all considered investment horizons until the onset of the COVID-19. Conversely, with the outbreak of the pandemic, the return spillover is more intense across financial assets, and a significant pairwise return connectedness between each equity index and hedging asset is observed. Hence, gold, oil, and Bitcoin do not exhibit safe-haven characteristics. However, by decomposing the time-varying co-movements into different investment horizons, we find that total and pairwise connectedness among the assets are primarily driven by a higher-frequency band (up to 4 days). It indicates that investors have diversification opportunities with gold, oil, and Bitcoin at longer horizons.

TSH recovered in the total sample showed a median of 2.64 mIU/L (2.5th-97.5th percentiles: 0.91-8.35 mIU/L); after removing outliers the reference values for the studied population were 0.87 to 5.21 mIU/L, without differences by sex. CONCLUSIONS: General laboratory practice should improve harmonization of TSH assays. This is a must in daily clinical practice, since it would allow us to share real reference intervals in an established population and may be related to the presence or absence of thyroid pathology.","output":"Reference Intervals for Thyrotropin Hormone in the General Andean Population of Quito-Ecuador Using Electrochemiluminescence Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a massive impact on waits for elective operations, with tens of thousands of scheduled surgeries being cancelled or postponed across Canada. Provincial governments will likely not only reopen elective surgical capacity when it is deemed safe, but also target new funding to address the backlog of cases. There is a dearth of research on whether the provinces' approaches to managing wait lists are equitable from a patients' needs perspective or if they are associated with patients' perception of outcomes. The surgical cost models used in the past won't be useful to governments and hospital managers. New models based on hospitals' marginal costs, associated with running on weekends or off-hours and social distancing parameters, will be needed. Surgeon input, collaboration and leadership during the strategy development, implementation and management of surgical wait lists postpandemic will be imperative, as these decisions will significantly affect the health and lives of many Canadians.","output":"Surgical wait list management in Canada during a pandemic: many challenges ahead."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet is especially important during the Covid-19 pandemic, where there is wide adoption of an online learning platform for teaching and learning.

More robust immune activation in women has been proposed to contribute to decreased disease severity, although systemic inflammation has been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection. Whether systemic inflammation contributes to sex differences in COVID-19 infection is not known. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined sex differences in inflammatory markers among 453 men (mean age 61) and 328 women (mean age 62) hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the Massachusetts General Hospital from March 8 to April 27, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of sex with initial and peak inflammatory markers. Exploratory analyses examined the association of sex and inflammatory markers with 28-day clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Initial and peak CRP were higher in men compared with women after adjustment for baseline differences (initial CRP: ? 0.29, SE 0.07, p = 0.0001; peak CRP: ? 0.31, SE 0.07, p<0.0001) with similar findings for IL-6, PCT, and ferritin (p<0.05 for all). Men had greater than 1.5-greater odds of dying compared with women (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04C2.80, p = 0.03). Sex modified the association of peak CRP with both death and ICU admission, with stronger associations observed in men compared with women (death: OR 9.19, 95% CI 4.29C19.7, p <0.0001 in men vs OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.52C5.18, p = 0.009 in women, P(interaction) = 0.02).

As the principal constituents of innate immunity, both type I and III IFNs share antiviral features. However, important properties, including preferential expression at mucosal barriers (such as respiratory tract), local influences, lower receptor distribution, smaller target cell types, noninflammatory effects, and immunomodulatory impacts, were attributed only to type III IFNs. Accordingly, type III IFNs can establish an optimal effective antiviral response, without triggering exaggerated systemic inflammation that is generally attributed to the type I IFNs. However, some harmful effects were attributed to the III IFNs and there are also major differences between human and mouse concerning the immunomodulatory effects of III IFNs.

Hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)/azithromycin (ATM) combination therapy is currently being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, with promising results. However, the molecular mechanism of action of this combination is not yet established. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this study shows that the drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells. Unexpected molecular similarity is shown between ATM and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, ATM interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site shared by ATM and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein. CLQ-OH molecules are shown to saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Taken together, these data show that ATM is directed against the virus, whereas CLQ-OH is directed against cellular attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host-cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where therapeutic intervention is likely to be most efficient. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy in patients with COVID-19.

Whether private mitigation yields net social benefits depends on the social weight given to the costs of illness and illness avoidance, now and into the future. We show that, for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially beneficial. However, in cases where society discounts the future at either very low or very high rates relative to private individuals, or where it places a low weight on the private cost of illness, the social cost of illness under proportionate mixing (doing nothing) may be lower than the social cost of illness under preferential mixing (avoiding infectious individuals). That is, under some circumstances, society would prefer shorter, more intense epidemics without avoidance costs over longer, less intense epidemics with avoidance costs.

Specifically, we aimed to evaluate how the relative growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths would have differed if all states had issued a mandate to mask in public by September 1, 2020 versus if all states had delayed issuing such a mandate. To do so, we applied the Causal Roadmap, a formal framework for causal and statistical inference.

Despite the natural experiment in state-level masking policies, the causal effect of interest was not identifiable. Nonetheless, we specified the target statistical parameter as the adjusted rate ratio (aRR): the expected outcome with early implementation divided by the expected outcome with delayed implementation, after adjusting for state-level confounders. To minimize strong estimation assumptions, primary analyses used targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner. After 60-days and at a national-level, early implementation was associated 9% reduction in new COVID-19 cases (aRR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.88-0.95) and a 16% reduction in new COVID-19 deaths (aRR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76-0.93).

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of respiratory pathogens identified by the Johns Hopkins Diagnostic Laboratory between December 2019 and October 2021 was performed. In addition, we assessed the contribution of respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 to symptomatic disease by retesting 2 cohorts of specimens that were (1) collected from symptomatic patients and (2) received limited respiratory pathogen testing.

A living systematic review with meta-analysis of recent RCTs indicates that the combination therapy of corticosteroids and tocilizumab produce better outcomes, while previous observational studies suggest that tocilizumab monotherapy is beneficial for substantial numbers of patients. However, what patients could respond to tocilizumab monotherapy remained unknown. Methods: In this retrospective study we evaluated the effects of tocilizumab monotherapy on the clinical characteristics, serum biomediator levels, viral elimination, and specific IgG antibody induction in 13 severely to critically ill patients and compared with those of dexamethasone monotherapy and dexamethasone plus tocilizumab. Results: A single tocilizumab administration led to a rapid improvement in clinical characteristics, inflammatory findings, and oxygen supply in 7 of 11 patients with severe COVID-19, and could recover from mechanical ventilation management (MVM) in 2 patients with critically ill COVID-19. Four patients exhibited rapidly worsening even after tocilizumab administration and required MVM and additional methylprednisolone treatment. Tocilizumab did not delay viral elimination or inhibit IgG production specific for the virus, whereas dexamethasone inhibited IgG induction. A multiplex cytokine array system revealed a significant increase in the serum expression of 54 out of 80 biomediators in patients with COVID-19 compared with that in healthy controls. Compared with those who promptly recovered in response to tocilizumab, patients requiring MVM showed a significantly higher ratio of basal level of ferritin/CRP and a persistent increase in the levels of CRP and specific cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IFN-, IP-10, and MCP-1. The basal high ratio of ferritin/CRP was also associated with clinical deterioration even in patients treated with dexamethasone and tocilizumab. Conclusion: Tocilizumab as monotherapy has substantial beneficial effects in some patients with severe COVID-19, who showed a relatively low level of the ratio of ferritin/CRP and prompt reduction in CRP, IL-6, IFN-, IP-10, and MCP-1. The high ratio of ferritin/CRP is associated with rapid worsening of pneumonia.

Clinical data and information regarding 30-day mortality, length of stay (LOS) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission of hospitalised Covid-19 patients during early first wave (10.03.2020 to 13.04.2020) and second wave (01.12.2020 to 09.02.2021) were collected. Treatment was limited to second wave and included either dexamethasone only or both remdesivir and dexamethasone. The effectiveness of dexamethasone only on 30-day mortality was measured.ResultsOf 373 patients (64.3% male) during the first wave, 24.9% died within 30 days. The 30-day mortality rate was lower during the second wave (61/324, 18.8%, p-value= 0.064). Patients were younger (mean [SD], 60.0 [16.5] years) and had higher body mass index (mean [SD], 30.3 [11.0] kg/m2) during the second wave than the first wave (68.7 [14.8] years and 28.2 [7.70] kg/m2). In the first wave, no patients received specific drug therapy for Covid-19. However, 86.5% of patients received dexamethasone only during the second wave. The LOS for the first wave was longer (median (IQR): 5 (2C11) days) compared to the second wave (4 (2C9) days, p=0.013). ICU admission during the second wave (11.2%) was also lower than the first wave (23.4%, p<0.001).

The major difference in treatment strategy between the two waves was the approval of drug therapies in hospitalised patients. Dexamethasone reduced the 30-day mortality, although it did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the retrospective nature and small sample size of this study.

However, the impact of the pandemic and relevant restrictions on PA participation, and any potential barriers to it, in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are not clear. Furthermore, we are unsure if any such PA changes have affected their body weight, mental wellbeing, and/or quality of life (QoL). Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of the lockdown on PA participation in people with RA, versus people without RA. Participants (n = 128; RA = 27, non-RA = 101) completed a self-administered online survey, which included questions on PA, body weight, mental wellbeing and QoL. PA participation during lockdown was significantly lower among RA versus non-RA participants (p < 0.001). Additionally, a similar profile of results was found where more RA participants vs non-RA participants reported reduced habitual PA (59% vs 33%) and increased body weight (59% vs 35%). Mental wellbeing scores were similarly low in both groups during lockdown (RA: 20.8  4.2; non-RA: 22.2  3.4, p = 0.080). Matched group comparisons identified similar trends to full sample analyses. In the first months of the lockdown, more people with RA reported decreased PA participation and increased body weight than their non-RA counterparts. Access to exercise equipment and facilities appears to be the main cause for these results. Looking beyond COVID-19, specific PA promotion for people with RA will be required to prevent a pandemic of inactivity.

Epigenome-wide association studies have revealed correlations between DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and AD pathology and diagnosis. Here, we report relationships between peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles measured using Infinium? MethylationEPIC BeadChip and AD progression in participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. RESULTS: The rate of cognitive decline from initial DNA sampling visit to subsequent visits was estimated by the slopes of the modified Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (mPACC; mPACC(digit) and mPACC(trailsB)) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) plots using robust linear regression in cognitively normal (CN) participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), respectively. In addition, diagnosis conversion status was assessed using a dichotomized endpoint. Two CpG sites were significantly associated with the slope of mPACC in CN participants (P < 5.79  10(?8) [Bonferroni correction threshold]); cg00386386 was associated with the slope of mPACC(digit), and cg09422696 annotated to RP11-661A12.5 was associated with the slope of CDR-SB. No significant CpG sites associated with diagnosis conversion status were identified. Genes involved in cognition and learning were enriched. A total of 19, 13, and 5 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with the slopes of mPACC(trailsB), mPACC(digit), and CDR-SB, respectively, were identified by both comb-p and DMRcate algorithms; these included DMRs annotated to HOXA4. Furthermore, 5 and 19 DMRs were associated with conversion status in CN and MCI participants, respectively. The most significant DMR was annotated to the AD-associated gene PM20D1 (chr1: 205,818,956 to 205,820,014 [13 probes], Sidak-corrected P = 7.74  10(?24)), which was associated with both the slope of CDR-SB and the MCI conversion status. CONCLUSION: Candidate CpG sites and regions in peripheral blood were identified as associated with the rate of cognitive decline in participants in the ADNI cohort. While we did not identify a single CpG site with sufficient clinical utility to be used by itself due to the observed effect size, a biosignature composed of DNA methylation changes may have utility as a prognostic biomarker for AD progression.

M(pro) is indispensable for virus replication and is a promising target of potential inhibitors of COVID-19. Recently, monomeric SARS-CoV2 M(pro), drug repurposing, and docking methods have facilitated the identification of several potential inhibitors. Results were refined through the assessment of dimeric SARS-CoV2 M(pro), which represents the functional state of enzyme. Docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) studies indicated that dimeric M(pro) most significantly impacts binding affinity tendency compared with the monomeric state, which suggests that dimeric state is most useful when performing studies aimed at identifying drugs targeting M(pro). In this study, we extend previous research by performing docking and MD simulation studies coupled with an MM/GBSA approach to assess binding of dimeric SARS-CoV2 M(pro) to 12 FDA-approved drugs (darunavir, indinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, diosmin, hesperidin, rutin, raltegravir, velpatasvir, ledipasvir, rosuvastatin, and bortezomib), which were identified as the best candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 in some previous dockings studies involving monomeric SARS-CoV2 M(pro). This analysis identified saquinavir as a potent inhibitor of dimeric SARS-CoV2 M(pro); therefore, the compound may have clinical utility against COVID-19.

EXPERT OPINION GAs demonstrate excellent cytotoxic, antimicrobial, enzyme inhibitory, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, and antiviral effects. It is interesting to note that the C-3(OH) and C30-CO2H functional groups make GAs very attractive lead structures for medicinal scientists since these functionalities allow the generation of further chemical diversity for improved pharmacological effects. Moreover, various GA analogues have been prepared via modification of the C30-CO2H. It is noteworthy that the C-30 amide of GA demonstrated better cytotoxic effects compared to the parent compounds. In addition, GAs have the capability to conjugate with other anticancer drugs or be converted into their halo or amino analogs which is expected to stimulate medicinal chemist to synthesize new lead compounds in cancer drug discovery.","output":"Therapeutic potential of glycyrrhetinic acids: a patent review (2010-2017)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The societal lockdown imposed in Canada in March 2020 to stem the spread of COVID-19 severed key points of connection for low-income Canadians who rely upon schools, libraries and even fast-food chains for internet connectivity.

IBV strains of the Ark serotype are highly prevalent in the Southeastern United States despite extensive vaccination. One explanation for this observation is the high genetic variability of IBV. In addition, IBV Ark-type vaccines may induce suboptimal mucosal immune responses, contributing to the prevalence and persistence of the Ark serotype. To test this hypothesis, chickens were ocularly vaccinated with a commercially available live attenuated IBV Ark-Delmarva Poultry Industry vaccine strain and both mucosal and systemic antibody responses were measured. The highest immunoglobulin A (IgA) spot-forming cell (SFC) response was observed in the Harderian glands (HG) and to a lesser extent in the spleen and conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissues, while a limited IgG SFC response was observed in either the mucosal or systemic immune compartment. Interestingly, the peak IgA SFC response occurred 2 days earlier in spleen than in the head-associated lymphoid tissues despite ocular vaccination. Furthermore, IgA IBV-specific antibody levels significantly increased over controls 3 days earlier in tears and 4 days earlier in plasma than did IgG antibodies. IgA antibody levels were higher than IgG antibody levels throughout the primary response in tears and were similar in magnitude in plasma. In addition, a very early increase in IgA antibodies on day 3 postvaccination was observed in tears; such a response was not observed in plasma. This early increase is consistent with a mucosal T-independent IgA response to IBV. In the secondary response the IBV antibody levels significantly increased over controls starting on day 1 after boosting, and the IgG antibody levels were higher than the IgA antibody levels in both tears and plasma. In summary, ocular vaccination induced higher IgA antibodies in the primary IBV response, while the memory response is dominated by IgG antibodies. Thus, lower mucosal IgA antibody levels are observed upon secondary exposure to IBV, which may contribute to vulnerability of host epithelial cells to infection by IBV and persistence of the Ark serotype.","output":"Immunoglobulin A as an early humoral responder after mucosal avian coronavirus vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detecting changes in COVID-19 disease transmission over time is a key indicator of epidemic growth.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand public attention toward the pandemic (from December 2019 to November 2020) through 7 types of sources: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, blogs, news sites, forums, and e-commerce sites. METHODS: We collected and analyzed nearly 38 million pieces of text data from the aforementioned sources via SocialHeat, a social listening (infoveillance) platform developed by YouNet Group. We described not only public attention volume trends, discussion sentiments, top sources, top posts that gained the most public attention, and hot keyword frequency but also hot keywords co-occurrence as visualized by the VOSviewer software tool. RESULTS: In this study, we reached four main conclusions. First, based on changing discussion trends regarding the COVID-19 subject, 7 periods were identified based on events that can be aggregated into two pandemic waves in Vietnam. Second, community pages on Facebook were the source of the most engagement from the public. However, the sources with the highest average interaction efficiency per article were government sources.

For the treament of stages IIa, IIb and III CanL, allopurinol/meglumine antimoniate (MA) was chosen by 69.8, 73.3 and 51.2% of respondents, respectively, followed by allopurinol/miltefosine (20.9, 19.8 and 38.4%, respectively). In contrast, dogs with stage IV CanL were mostly treated with allopurinol/miltefosine (48.8%) rather than with allopurinol/MA (23.3%). The use of repellents was the preferred preventive strategy (98.8%). About 93.0% of responders were aware of the existence of guidelines, and most of these veterinarians consulted the guidelines of the LeishVet group and the Canine Leishmaniosis Working Group; however, 31.3% reported that they did not follow any specific recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Of the veterinarians responding to the survey, most reported following international guidelines for the clinical management of CanL. While allopurinol/MA was the preferred therapeutic protocol for the treatment of stages II/III CanL, allopurinol/miltefosine was the first choice for the treatment of stage IV CanL, possibly due to the unpredictable effect of MA on renal function. This study contributes to a better understanding of the trends in practical approaches to the treatment of CanL in Portugal.

These structures were first described over a century ago and originally termed X-bodies, as their function was not immediately appreciated. Whilst some inclusion bodies may represent cytopathic by-products of viral protein over-accumulation, X-bodies have emerged as virus factories, quasi-organelles that coordinate diverse viral infection processes such as replication, protein expression, evasion of host defenses, virion assembly, and intercellular transport. Accordingly, they are now generally referred to as viral replication complexes (VRCs). We previously used confocal fluorescence microscopy to unravel the complex structure of X-bodies produced by Potato virus X (PVX). Here we used 3D-structured illumination (3D-SIM) super-resolution microscopy to map the PVX X-body at a finer scale. We identify a previously unrecognized membrane structure induced by the PVX triple gene block (TGB) proteins, providing new insights into the complex interplay between virus and host within the X-body.","output":"Unraveling the Structure of Viral Replication Complexes at Super-Resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most commonly considered infection with a Bartonella species is cat-scratch disease caused by Bartonella henselae.

No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Usual palliative treatment includes maintaining hydration and nutrition and controlling fever and cough. The clinical severity and extent of transmission need to be determined, and therapeutic options need to be developed and optimized. METHODS: The present review discusses the recent repurposing of drugs for COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: Several compounds, including remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, interferon-?, ribavirin, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, and ivermectin, have emerged as promising alternatives. They block the virus from entering host cells, prevent viral replication, and attenuate exacerbation of the host's immune response. CONCLUSION: Although some evidence indicates the positive actions of different classes of compounds for the treatment of COVID-19, few clinical assays have been established to definitively demonstrate their therapeutic value in humans. Multicenter clinical studies are urgently needed to validate and standardize therapeutic regimens that involve these agents. Although science has not yet presented us with a specific drug against COVID-19, the repurposing of drugs appears to be promising in our fight against this devastating disease.","output":"Repurposing Drugs for the Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent decades have witnessed growing popularity in embodied philanthropy, where participants undertake various types of publicly displayed bodily labour in support of their respective causes. The fundraising potential of such efforts reached extraordinary heights during Sir Captain Thomas Moore's Walk for the National Health Service, wherein the 99-year-old World War II veteran walked laps of his garden to raise funds during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within less than a month Captain Tom raised over 30 million, the highest amount ever by an individual charity walker. To better understand the social and cultural drivers behind Moore's incredible popularity this article applies Julie Robert's theoretical framework of embodied philanthropy, exploring the multivalent semiotic potential that Moore radiated through his age, disability, military adornments, Yorkshire grit, and unfailingly positive, aphoristic style of speaking. During a time of global crisis, this distinct array of bodily affordances enabled Captain Tom to simultaneously serve as an honest broker, teacher, exemplar, rallying figure, and ultimately martyr. Such practices of sacrificial citizenship, however, raise troubling questions, particularly in relation to expectations that fellow citizens should likewise stoically uphold civic-minded resilience during times of crisis. Furthermore, while the potential benefits can prove extraordinarily impactful, organizations should exercise care in too readily attaching themselves to particular causes, lest they become complicit in contentious agendas or even inadvertently mislead donors. ? 2022 The Authors.

The annual outbreaks tended to show two peaks in Okinawa, in summer and winter, although the main islands of Japan, located in a temperate climate area, showed only winter influenza activity. Epidemic types and subtypes in Okinawa mostly matched those on the main islands of Japan in winter and those in Taiwan in summer. Rates of amantadine resistance dramatically increased, from 7.3% in the November 2002-to-March 2003 season to 90.0% in summer 2005, and a similarly high rate of resistance continued for the rest of the study period. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of A/H3N2 isolates collected from 2002 to 2007 revealed a monophyletic lineage that was divided into four period groups. Each group included amantadine-sensitive and -resistant viruses within independent clusters. In the November 2005-to-March 2006 season, all of the amantadine-resistant viruses were clustered in clade N, with dual (position 193 and 225) amino acid mutations in their HA1 subunits. In 2005, clade N amantadine-resistant viruses existed in Okinawa several months before the circulation of this clade on the main islands of Japan. In conclusion, surveillance in Okinawa to monitor influenza virus circulation is important for elucidating the dynamics of virus transmission in a border area between temperate and subtropical areas, as Okinawa is one of the best sentinel points in Japan.","output":"Epidemiologic study of influenza infection in Okinawa, Japan, from 2001 to 2007: changing patterns of seasonality and prevalence of amantadine-resistant influenza A virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Non-operative management (NOM) of acute appendicitis has been assessed in several studies before COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review aimed to assess the extent of adoption, efficacy, and safety of NOM of acute appendicitis in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of the literature. Electronic databases and Google Scholar were queried for studies that applied NOM of acute appendicitis during COVID-19. The main outcome measures were the rates of NOM application during the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period, failure and complication rates of NOM. Failure was defined as the need for appendectomy during NOM and complications included development of appendicular mass or abscess. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (2140 patients) were included. The male to female ratio was 1.44:1 and median age was 34. Nine hundred fifty-nine (44.8%) patients had a trial of NOM. The weighted mean rate of NOM application was 50.1% (95%CI: 29.8-70.5%). The application of NOM during the pandemic was significantly more likely than its application before COVID-19 (OR = 6.7, p < 0.001). The weight mean failure rate of NOM was 16.4% (95%CI: 9.4-23.4). NOM failure was more likely in children and patients with complicated appendicitis. The weighted mean complication rate after NOM was 4.5% (95%CI: 1.4-7.7). NOM had significantly lower odds for complications than appendectomy (OR = 0.36, p = 0.03). There was no mortality after application of NOM. CONCLUSION: NOM of acute appendicitis in the setting of COVID-19 may be a safe, short-term alternative to surgery with acceptably low failure and complication rates.","output":"Rate of Application and Outcome of Non-operative Management of Acute Appendicitis in the Setting of COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of pulmonary fibrosis development by combining follow-up thin-section CT findings and clinical features in patients discharged after treatment for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study involved 32 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the evidence of fibrosis on their latest follow-up CT imaging. Clinical data and CT imaging features of all the patients in different stages were collected and analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: The latest follow-up CT imaging showed fibrosis in 14 patients (male, 12; female, 2) and no fibrosis in 18 patients (male, 10; female, 8). Compared with the non-fibrosis group, the fibrosis group was older (median age: 54.0 years vs. 37.0 years, p = 0.008), and the median levels of C-reactive protein (53.4 mg/L vs. 10.0 mg/L, p = 0.002) and interleukin-6 (79.7 pg/L vs. 11.2 pg/L, p = 0.04) were also higher. The fibrosis group had a longer-term of hospitalization (19.5 days vs. 10.0 days, p = 0.001), pulsed steroid therapy (11.0 days vs. 5.0 days, p < 0.001), and antiviral therapy (12.0 days vs. 6.5 days, p = 0.012). More patients on the worst-state CT scan had an irregular interface (59.4% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.045) and a parenchymal band (71.9% vs. 28.1%, p < 0.001). On initial CT imaging, the irregular interface (57.1%) and parenchymal band (50.0%) were more common in the fibrosis group. On the worst-state CT imaging, interstitial thickening (78.6%), air bronchogram (57.1%), irregular interface (85.7%), coarse reticular pattern (28.6%), parenchymal band (92.9%), and pleural effusion (42.9%) were more common in the fibrosis group. CONCLUSION: Fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially in patients with high inflammatory indicators. Interstitial thickening, irregular interface, coarse reticular pattern, and parenchymal band manifested in the process of the disease may be predictors of pulmonary fibrosis. Irregular interface and parenchymal band could predict the formation of pulmonary fibrosis early.","output":"Prediction of the Development of Pulmonary Fibrosis Using Serial Thin-Section CT and Clinical Features in Patients Discharged after Treatment for COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How different cultures react and respond given a crisis is predominant in a society's norms and political will to combat the situation. Often the decisions made are necessitated by events, social pressure, or the need of the hour, which may not represent the will of the nation.

The effect of OMZ on these parameters as well as on respiratory burst activity and oxidative stress marker 8-isprostane was analyzed in unstimulated and co-stimulated PMN by ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) or opsonized zymosan (OZ), respectively. In unstimulated cells, OMZ induced formation of PGE(2), 15(S)-HETE, and LXA(4). The levels of LTB(4) and 8-isoprostane were not affected, whereas respiratory burst activity was drastically inhibited. In UCP- and OZ-stimulated control cells, all parameters were elevated. Here, OMZ maintained the increased levels of PGE(2), 15(S)-HETE, and LXA(4), but substantially suppressed levels of LTB(4) and 8-isoprostane and inhibited the respiratory burst activity. These findings suggest a switch from the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid class LTB(4) to the pro-resolving LXA(4).

As artificial agents do not have a legal position, humans should be held accountable if actions do not comply, implying humans need to exercise control. This is often labeled as Meaningful Human Control (MHC). In this paper, achieving MHC is addressed as a design problem, defining the collaboration between humans and agents. We propose three possible team designs (Team Design Patterns), varying in the level of autonomy on the agents part. The team designs include explanations given by the agent to clarify its reasoning and decision-making. The designs were implemented in a simulation of a medical triage task, to be executed by a domain expert and an artificial agent. The triage task simulates making decisions under time pressure, with too few resources available to comply with all medical guidelines all the time, hence involving moral choices. Domain experts (i.e., health care professionals) participated in the present study. One goal was to assess the ecological relevance of the simulation. Secondly, to explore the control that the human has over the agent to warrant moral compliant behavior in each proposed team design. Thirdly, to evaluate the role of agent explanations on the humans understanding in the agents reasoning. Results showed that the experts overall found the task a believable simulation of what might occur in reality. Domain experts experienced control over the teams moral compliance when consequences were quickly noticeable. When instead the consequences emerged much later, the experts experienced less control and felt less responsible. Possibly due to the experienced time pressure implemented in the task or over trust in the agent, the experts did not use explanations much during the task; when asked afterwards they however considered these to be useful. It is concluded that a team design should emphasize and support the human to develop a sense of responsibility for the agents behavior and for the teams decisions.

This upturn looms as the fourth major transition in humanCmicrobe relationships since the advent of agriculture around 10,000 years ago. About 30 new diseases have been identified, including Legionnaires' disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis C, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)/variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), Nipah virus, several viral hemorrhagic fevers and, most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. The emergence of these diseases, and resurgence of old ones like tuberculosis and cholera, reflects various changes in human ecology: rural-to-urban migration resulting in high-density peri-urban slums; increasing long-distance mobility and trade; the social disruption of war and conflict; changes in personal behavior; and, increasingly, human-induced global changes, including widespread forest clearance and climate change. Political ignorance, denial and obduracy (as with HIV/AIDS) further compound the risks.

Lack of knowledge of the biological mechanisms of viruses, plus the absence of effective treatments against the disease (COVID-19) and/or vaccines have pulled factors that can compromise the proper functioning of the immune system to fight against infectious diseases into the spotlight. The optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. Specifically, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated and deems six vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B(6), B(12)) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. In this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the COVID-19 pandemic context was carried out. First, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in COVID-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in PubMed and LitCovid databases. Second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 European countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological COVID-19 data (available in the Worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. Furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAs) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. Therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by Ensembl) of individuals from European populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. Results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of COVID-19. Besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrientsespecially Vitamins D, C, B(12), and ironare inversely associated with higher COVID-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","output":"Current State of Evidence: Influence of Nutritional and Nutrigenetic Factors on Immunity in the COVID-19 Pandemic Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical activity (PA), associated with all-cause mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs, improves vitamin D absorption, immune response, and stress when completed outdoors.

Therefore, the study purpose was (1) to identify and adopt validated instruments for trail audit evaluations using geospatial video and a composite score and (2) to determine if geospatial video and a composite score motivate (influence the decision to use) specific trail selection among current trail users. Phase 1 used a mixed-method exploratory sequential core design using qualitative data, then quantitative data for the development of the Spatial-temporal Trail Audit Tool (STAT). Geospatial videos of two Northeast Ohio trails were collected using a bicycle-mounted spatial video camera and video analysis software. The creation of STAT was integrated from Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS), Walk Score, and Path Environment Audit Tool (PEAT) audit tools based on four constructs: trail accessibility, conditions, amenities, and safety. Scoring was determined by three independent reviewers. Phase 2 included a mixed-method convergent core design to test the applicability of STAT for trail participant motivation. STAT has 20 items in 4 content areas computing a composite score and was found to increase trail quality and motivation for use.

The present study explored the influence of hazard type, trait anxiety, and warning message on different components of risk perception. A survey examined 614 German participants (18-96 years, M = 31.64, 63.0% female) using a pre-post comparison. Participants were randomly allocated to one of five hazards (severe weather, act of violence, breakdown of emergency number, discovery of a World War II bomb, or major fire) for which they received a warning message. Four components of risk perception (perceived severity, anticipatory worry, anticipated emotions, and perceived likelihood) were measured before and after the receipt. Also, trait anxiety was assessed. Analyses of covariance of risk perception were calculated, examining the effect of warning message, trait anxiety, and hazard type while controlling for age, gender, and previous hazard experience. Results showed main effects of hazard type and trait anxiety on every component of risk perception, except for perceived likelihood. The receipt of a warning message led to a significant decrease in anticipated negative emotions. However, changes across components of risk perception, as well as hazards, were inconsistent, as perceived severity decreased while perceived likelihood and anticipatory worry increased. In addition, three interactional effects were found (perceived severity  hazard type, perceived severity  trait anxiety, and anticipated emotions  hazard type). The findings point toward differences in the processing of warning messages yet underline the importance of hazard type, as well as characteristics of the recipient.","output":"Storms, Fires, and Bombs: Analyzing the Impact of Warning Message and Receiver Characteristics on Risk Perception in Different Hazards."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been causing a worldwide pandemic since the end of 2019.

The two expressions are very often used interchangeably especially when it comes to their application. In this paper, the differences between business continuity and disaster recovery are discussed. The disaster management cycle is also addressed in order to highlight the importance of having plans before, during and after the occurrence of an incident.Design/methodology/approachA review of the extant literature on business continuity and disaster recovery was made. A number of different views were then presented in order to provide a better understanding of the two concepts and their potential overlap/connection. The literature review was conducted in 2020 using a variety of academic resources ranging from journal articles to text books and credible Internet websites. Relevant journal articles were obtained from two primary databases: Emerald Insight and EBSCOhost. Keywords, such as DRP, continuity, disruption and BCP, were mainly used to facilitate the search for these resources and other related material.FindingsReviewing the literature revealed that BCP and DRP are not the same. Yet, they are used interchangeably very often in the literature. This indicates a possible relationship/overlap between the two. The relationship between BCP and DRP can be viewed from a variety of perspectives, which altogether provide a better understanding of their purposes and application.Practical implicationsOn top of the need to differentiate between business continuity and disaster recovery, the widespread impact of the current COVID-19 crisis, especially on businesses and supply chains, has unfolded the necessity to deal with business disruptions in all their forms and the significance of quick and effective recovery. This research clarifies the purpose of BCP and the purpose of DRP and their role in combating impacts of disruptive incidents on businesses and organizations.Originality/valueBCP and DRP are discussed extensively in the literature. Yet, few studies attempted to address the precise functions of the two resulting in an obvious confusion between their meaning and purpose which subsequently reduced the uniqueness of their application and the uniqueness of the application of each.

Objective: To assess whether suicide rates in Japan increased in April through November 2020 compared with previous years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used national data obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare from 2016 to 2020 on the monthly number of individuals who died of suicide in Japan from January to November of 2016 to 2020. Exposure: 2020 vs previous years. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was monthly suicide rates, calculated as the number of individuals who died of suicide divided by the total population. A difference-in-difference regression model was used to estimate the change in monthly suicide rates in April to November 2020 vs these months in 2016 to 2019. Results: Analyses included 90a?048 individuals (61a?366 [68.1%] men) who died of suicide from 2016 to 2020. The difference-in-difference analysis of men showed that there was no increase in suicide rates from April through September 2020 compared with these months in 2016 to 2019, but that suicide rates were increased in October (difference-in-difference, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.67] suicide deaths per 100a?000 population) and November (difference-in-difference, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.60] suicide deaths per 100a?000 population). Among women, suicide rates in 2020 compared with 2016 to 2019 increased in July (difference-in-difference, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.38] suicide deaths per 100a?000 population), August (difference-in-difference, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.45] suicide deaths per 100a?000 population), September (difference-in-difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44] suicide deaths per 100a?000 population), October (difference-in-difference, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.77] suicide deaths per 100a?000 population), and November (difference-in-difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44] suicide deaths per 100a?000 population). In secondary analyses in which the suicide rates of 2020 were compared with the expected rates based on trends from 2011 to 2019, the increases in suicide rates were most pronounced among men aged younger than 30 years (eg, November: observed vs expected rate ratio [RR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.26-1.71]) and women aged younger than 30 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.76 to 2.52]) and 30 to 49 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.30 [95% CI, 2.01 to 2.58]).

Methods: Between December 2014 and December 2019, 13 patients underwent the reconstruction of soft tissue defects in various sites using the lower trapezius musculocutaneous flap carrying a portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle. There were 10 males and 3 females, with an average age of 52.1 years (range, 29-83 years). Twelve wounds were resulted from resection of various malignant tumor, including 6 cases of head and neck tumors, 5 cases of shoulder and back tumors, 1 case of chest and back tumors. Among the 12 cases, 4 cases were complicated with wound infection and bone exposure, 1 case with skull defect and cerebral dura exposure, and 1 case with wound infection, skull necrosis, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. One case was injured in a traffic accident, which resulted in infection wound in the back and shoulder and bone exposure. The sizes of the defect and musculocutaneous flap ranged from 11 cm7 cm to 23 cm15 cm and 25 cm8 cm to 40 cm14 cm, respectively. According to the spatial relationship between the donor and recipient sites, propeller flaps (8 cases) or percutaneous tunnel island flaps (5 cases) were used to transfer the myocutaneous flap to the recipient area to repair the wound. The donor site was directly closed and sutured in 9 cases, and those with excessive tension were repaired with free skin grafts in 2 cases or transferred flaps in 2 cases. Results: After the operation, necrosis of the distal 4-cm of the musculocutaneous flap occurred in 2 cases. After debridement, the resultant wounds were reconstructed using a local flap and a posterior intercostal artery perforator flap, respectively. The remaining 11 myocutaneous flaps survived completely without arteries and veins crisis. The wounds in the donor and recipient areas healed by first intention. All the patients were followed up 1 to 48 months (mean, 7.4 months). The color and texture of the flap were good. During the follow-up, 1 patient underwent tumor resection again due to tumor recurrence, and 1 patient with a scalp hemangiosarcoma died due to unexplained thoracic hemorrhage. Tumor recurrence was not found in the remaining patients. The musculocutaneous flap coverage was stable and the infection was controlled.

Peripheric (olfactory bulb [OB] volume and olfactory sulcus [OS] depth) and central (insular gyrus and corpus amygdala areas) smell regions were measured. RESULTS Smell loss was present in nine patients (39.1%) in the PG. The means of the disease duration and antiviral treatment were 3.00  2.35 and 5.65  1.72 days, respectively. OB volumes of the PG were significantly lower than those of the HCs bilaterally. However, no significant differences were observed between the OS depth, insular gyrus, and corpus amygdala areas of both groups. The left corpus amygdala areas were both increased with the increased disease (P = 0.035, r = 0.442) and treatment durations (P = 0.037, r = 0.438). In the PG, longer treatment duration, increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count decrease, and positive thoracic computed tomography (CT) involvement were related to OS depth decrease.

In contrast, this research seeks out the perspectives of farmers who participate in VBSCs. A nationwide farmer survey conducted in 2017 offers original insights on farmer motivations for participating in VBSCs and how they are being used by farmers relative to other marketing channels. We find that VBSCs serve farms of all sizes. Overall, smaller farms were more likely to market a higher percentage of overall sales through their VBSC and more likely to rank their VBSC as one of the top three marketing channels in their portfolio. But it was the larger farms that were more likely to perceive VBSC-specific benefits. Our findings confirm that while there is a limited volume of product that such regional supply chains can currently handle, farmers view VBSCs as a valuable marketing option that aligns with their own values and preserves their products identity.

the domains of student engagement, instructional strategies, classroom management, and computer skills The instrument used to measure teacher efficacy for online teaching was a 32-item, web-based

result of this situation, World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease as pandemic (global epidemic) on March 11, 2020 Nations are collaborating against this disease which is seen in almost all countries of the world and they are taking some precautions It is stated by the authorities that the measures taken alone by countries cannot be enough to prevent such global epidemics and that nations should act as a global whole In addition, it is clear that societies activating their internal dynamics Csocial, political, religious, cultural, etc -can be effective at the point of preventing/taking under control this global epidemic Variables that may occur regionally, locally or globally have a significant role in the spread or prevention of diseases Minstrels, who have undertaken the duty to express the pain, problems, happiness, love, fears and enthusiasm of the people in every period and who have thus become their spokesperson in a sense, were not indifferent to this novel virus and they expressed the existing situation and the conditions brought about by this condition in their poems This study discusses how minstrels addressed and expressed their views about how the society perceived the situation with the emergence of the virus in the poems in their social media accounts and various platforms In this way, the study aims to understand in which direction minstrels manipu-late the society and what kind of social responsibility they undertake on the issue It can be stated that during the global epidemic, minstrels created poems on many issues such as curfew, coronavirus opportunists, opposing spiritual values, the effects of the virus on economic and social life, holy places being empty, social media posts, abiding by the rules of cleaning, taking a break from education, praising healthcare workers, call to stay at home, reproach to the source of the virus, persecution to East Turkistan, and reaction to world leaders and thus interpreted the feelings of the people In addition, it was found that all the stakeholders fulfilled their duty in the continuation of tradition in the face of this global epidemic Bringing many elements of the tradition C minstrel act, minstrel call-and-response, telling stories and fairy tales, etc -to the viewers/listeners especially by making use of social media can be evaluated as the most important indicator that the tradition is continued in the liveliest way Despite the views of minstrels on making use of folk medicine in the face of epidemic diseases in previous centuries, it

METHODS: A retrospective study is conducted to study whether air quality index (AQI), four ambient air pollutants (PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2) and CO) and five meteorological variables (daily temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, temperature difference and sunshine duration) could increase COVID-19 incidence in Wuhan and XiaoGan between Jan 26(th) to Feb 29(th) in 2020. RESULTS: First, a significant correlation was found between COVID-19 incidence and AQI in both Wuhan (R(2) = 0.13, p < 0.05) and XiaoGan (R(2) = 0.223, p < 0.01). Specifically, among four pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was prominently correlated with PM(2.5) and NO(2) in both cities. In Wuhan, the tightest correlation was observed between NO(2) and COVID-19 incidence (R(2) = 0.329, p < 0.01). In XiaoGan, in addition to the PM(2.5) (R(2) = 0.117, p < 0.01) and NO(2) (R(2) = 0.015, p < 0.05), a notable correlation was also observed between the PM(10) and COVID-19 incidence (R(2) = 0.105, p < 0.05). Moreover, temperature is the only meteorological parameter that constantly correlated well with COVID-19 incidence in both Wuhan and XiaoGan, but in an inverse correlation (p < 0.05).

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey targeting OTO-HNS program directors (PD) was created and disseminated via email to PDs on May 28th 2020. Descriptive analyses of the 19-question survey was performed, and free text responses for certain suitable questions were thematically categorized into groups determined to be relevant during analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 123 solicited PDs (23.6%) completed the survey. Nineteen (65.5%) respondents indicated they would not host away rotations (AR) in 2020, and 9 (31.0%) reported that they would consider away rotators without home programs. Regarding the historical importance of AR, 21 (72.4%) PDs stated they were either extremely or very important in evaluating candidates. Sixteen (55.2%) PDs stated that virtual interviews would impact their ability to properly gauge candidates and 12 (41.4%) were unsure. Eight PDs (27.6%) stated their evaluation of candidates will likely change, with a shift toward an increased reliance on letters of recommendation, research involvement, and clerkship grades. The large majority of PDs25 (86.2%)were not worried that the COVID-19 pandemic would affect the abilities of new interns beginning in 2021. CONCLUSION: Virtual interviews and engagement activities will mostly supplant sub-Is and AR for the 2020-2021 OTO-HNS application cycle. Surveyed PDs largely believe these will be insufficient in providing a comprehensive assessment of candidates, and will similarly limit applicants ability to gauge residency programs.

Recent disruptions to global supply chains due to the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed the high risk and challenges of managing sustainable global and intertwined supply chain networks. Using the data mined from financial records, the present study constructs the global supply chain network of the auto manufacturing sector.

It is considered a challenging problem due to existing similar image densities in the pulmonary structures, different types of scanners, and scanning protocols. Most of the current semi-automatic segmentation methods rely on human factors therefore it might suffer from lack of accuracy. Another shortcoming of these methods is their high false-positive rate. In recent years, several approaches, based on a deep learning framework, have been effectively applied in medical image segmentation. Among existing deep neural networks, the U-Net has provided great success in this field. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network architecture to perform an automatic lung CT image segmentation process. In the proposed method, several extensive preprocessing techniques are applied to raw CT images. Then, ground truths corresponding to these images are extracted via some morphological operations and manual reforms. Finally, all the prepared images with the corresponding ground truth are fed into a modified U-Net in which the encoder is replaced with a pre-trained ResNet-34 network (referred to as Res BCDU-Net). In the architecture, we employ BConvLSTM (Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-term Memory)as an advanced integrator module instead of simple traditional concatenators. This is to merge the extracted feature maps of the corresponding contracting path into the previous expansion of the up-convolutional layer. Finally, a densely connected convolutional layer is utilized for the contracting path. The results of our extensive experiments on lung CT images (LIDC-IDRI database) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method where a dice coefficient index of 97.31% is achieved.","output":"ResBCDU-Net: A Deep Learning Framework for Lung CT Image Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of Yellow fever virus (YF) occurred in Maranh?o State in 1993 (Barra do Corda, Esperantinpolis and Mirador) and 1994 (Pastos Bons), where several cases were reported.

Now, MAs are foundational to team-based care, interacting with patients, systems, and teams in many ways. The transition to Virtual Health during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a further rapid and unique shift of MA roles and responsibilities. We sought to understand the impact of this shift and to place their new roles in the context of national professional competency standards. METHODS: In this qualitative, grounded theory study we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 MAs at 10 primary care sites at a major academic medical center on their experiences during the shift from in-person to virtual care. MAs were selected by convenience sample. Coding was done in Dedoose version 8.335. Consensus-based inductive and deductive approaches were used for interview analysis. Identified MA roles were compared to national MA, Institute of Medicine, physician, and nursing professional competency domains. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: Role Apprehension, Role Expansion, and Adaptability/Professionalism. Nine key roles emerged in the context of virtual visits: direct patient care (pre-visit and physical care), panel management, health systems ambassador, care coordination, patient flow coordination, scribing, quality improvement, and technology support. While some prior MA roles were limited by the virtual care shift, the majority translated directly or expanded in virtual care. Identified roles aligned better with Institute of Medicine, physician, and nursing professional competencies, than current national MA curricula. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to Virtual Health decreased MA's direct clinical work and expanded other roles within interprofessional care, notably quality improvement and technology support. Comparison of the current MA roles with national training program competencies identified new leadership and teamwork competencies which could be expanded during MA training to better support MA roles on inter-professional teams.","output":"Transforming Interprofessional Roles During Virtual Health Care: The Evolving Role of the Medical Assistant, in Relationship to National Health Profession Competency Standards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about renewed conversation about equality and equity in the distribution of medical resources. Much of the recent conversation has focused on creating and implementing policies in times of crisis when resources are exhausted. Depending on how the pandemic develops, some communities may implement crisis measures, but many health care facilities are currently experiencing shortages of staff and materials even if the facilities have not implemented crisis standards. There is a need for shared conversation about equality and equity in these times of contingency between conventional and crisis medicine. To respond well to these challenges, I recommend that institutions rely on policy, professional education, and ethics consultation. As is the case with crisis policies, creating contingency policies requires that health care professionals decide on how, specifically, to achieve equity. A policy is only as effective as its implementation; therefore, institutions should invest in context-specific education on contingency policies.

We also collect a variety of symptoms and co-morbidities discussed in reference to COVID-19. Our clustering algorithm identifies topics represented by groups of related terms, and computes clusters corresponding to documents associated with the topic terms. Among the topics we observe several that persist through the duration of multiple weeks and have numerous associated documents, as well several that appear as emerging topics with fewer documents.

However, cardiovascular diseases are still a worldwide main health problem. Patients are afraid to go to the hospital because of the risk of being infected with SARS-COV2. In particular, exercise testing (ET) has been underused, due to the fear of the airborne aerosol generation. There are cardiology centers performing ET that ask patient to wear a mask, although its consequences are not yet well known and there is only preliminary information of its use in patients with heart disease. PURPOSE: Our objective was to evaluate the ergometric behavior of patients that performed an ET wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-G) and compare them with patients in the pre-pandemic period. METHODS: A cohort of patients who underwent an ET from march to december 2020 was compared with patients that performed an ET between march and december 2019. Because of COVID-19 preventive restrictions, we used a larger and highly ventilated room to perform ET. The antisepsis protocol was performed (room and equipment) and healthcare crew always wore high efficiency masks and ocular protection. All patients studied in 2020, must had succeeded a biological triage, and wore a mask throughout the ET. Variables are presented as frequency (percentage), mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile interval) according to variable-type and distribution. Chi-square test, Student's t test or the Wilcoxon rank test were used as appropriate. All p values less than 0.05 were considered stochastically significant. RESULTS: A total of 361 stress tests were studied, where 209 (58%) belonged to pre-pandemic group and 152 (42%) to COVID-G. Eighty-one percent were male, the mean age was 4620 years and the most prevalent diagnosis was coronary heart disease (61%). There were no statistically diferences between groups according to demographic variables. No mayor adverse outcome occurred during ET. The most common reason of exercise suspension in COVID-G was dyspnea compared to pre-pandemic studies: 117 (77%) vs 8 (4%), OR= 6.3 (95% CI, 4.6 to 8.6, p<0.001). Heart rate behavior along ET did not show significant differences between groups. Nevertheless, blood pressure levels were significantly higher in COVID-G patients than those in pre-pandemic group. Exertional blood pressure index was higher in the COVID-G (1.310.24 vs 1.260.2, p<0.05) than the pre-pandemic group. On the other side, maximal exercise tolerance (METs) did not show significant differences between groups (p=ns). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise testing can be safely performed in patients with cardiovascular disease while wearing masks. In the COVID period, a significantly lower number of ET was performed. In addition, ET performance with mask was associated with higher values of systolic blood pressure and an increased number of tests suspended due to dyspnea.

The numbers of patients showing symptoms for COVID-19 have caused medical facilities at hospitals to become unavailable or overcrowded, which is a major challenge. Studies have recently allowed us to determine that COVID-19 can be diagnosed with the aid of chest X-ray images. To combat the COVID-19 outbreak, developing a deep learning (DL) based model for automated COVID-19 diagnosis on chest X-ray is beneficial. In this research, we have proposed a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The model is based on nine layers which uses a binary classification method to differentiate between COVID-19 and normal chest X-rays. It provides COVID-19 detection early so the patients can be admitted in a timely fashion. The proposed model was trained and tested on two publicly available datasets. Cross-dataset studies are used to assess the robustness in a real-world context. Six hundred X-ray images were used for training and two hundred X-rays were used for validation of the model. The X-ray images of the dataset were preprocessed to improve the results and visualized for better analysis. The developed algorithm reached 98% precision, recall and f1-score. The cross-dataset studies also demonstrate the resilience of deep learning algorithms in a real-world context with 98.5 percent accuracy. Furthermore, a comparison table was created which shows that our proposed model outperforms other relative models in terms of accuracy.

Since then, other PCR panels for detection of several respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens have been approved by the FDA and are commercially available, and more such panels are likely to become available. These assays detect 12 to 20 pathogens, and some include pathogens that typically cause different manifestations of infection, although they infect the same organ system. Some of these tests are labor-intensive, while others require little labor, and all of them are expensive, both for the laboratory and for the patient or insurer. They include a bundle of tests with limited or no options for selecting which tests will be performed. Laboratories and hospitals have adopted different strategies for offering these assays. Some have implemented strategies to limit the use of the tests, such as limiting the frequency with which patients can be tested, restricting testing to specific groups of patients (e.g., immunocompromised patients), or providing education to encourage the use of less expensive tests before using large multiplex panels. Others have offered these assays without limiting their use, either relying on the ordering provider to exercise good judgment or because such assays are thought to be appropriate for first-line diagnostic testing.

How to quickly track the resident location and activity trajectory of the population, and identify the spread risk of the COVID-19 in geospatial space has important theoretical and practical significance for controlling the spread of the virus on a large scale. In this study, we take the geographical community as the research object, and use the mobile phone trajectory data to construct the spatiotemporal profile of the potential high-risk population. First, by using the spatiotemporal data collision method, identify, and recover the trajectories of the people who were in the same area with the confirmed patients during the same time. Then, based on the range of activities of both cohorts (the confirmed cases and the potentially infected groups), we analyze the risk level of the relevant places and evaluate the scale of potential spread.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Since July 2020 and promoted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented the use of DSCT after cerebrovascular CT angiography (CTA) among patients with AIS using a dual-layer spectral CT. We explored the presence of CE sources, as well as late myocardium iodine enhancement (LIE) and pulmonary thromboembolism. Among patients further undergoing transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or cardiac CTA, we explored the diagnostic performance. RESULTS Fifty consecutive patients with AIS who underwent DSCT after cerebrovascular CTA comprised the patient population. The confidence degree for excluding cardiac thrombi was significantly higher than for LIE (4.40.8 vs. 3.41.3, p<0.0001). DSCT identified a CE source in 4 (8%) and LIE in 24 (48%) patients. The iodine ratio of CE sources was significantly lower compared to the left atrial appendage of patients with no CE sources (0.250.1 mg/mL vs. 0.910.2 mg/mL, p<0.0001). TEE/cardiac CT, performed in 20 (40%) patients, identified a CE source in 5 (25%) cases, whereas DSCT identified 4 (20%), leading to a sensitivity and specificity of 80% (95% CI 28-99%) and 100% (95% CI 78-100%) respectively (kappa 0.86).

The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese patients receiving MHD. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From December 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, a total of 1,027 MHD patients in 5 large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China, were enrolled. Patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptoms and initial computed tomography (CT) of the chest. If patients developed symptoms after the initial screening was negative, repeat CT was performed. Patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were tested with 2 consecutive throat swabs for viral RNA. In mid-March 2020, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained for all MHD patients. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody testing results for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOMES: Morbidity, clinical features, and laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Differences between groups were examined using t test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected with those infected and comparing those with infection detected using NAT with those with infection detected by positive serology test results. RESULTS: Among 1,027 patients receiving MHD, 99 were identified as having SARS-CoV-2 infection, for a prevalence of 9.6%. Among the 99 cases, 52 (53%) were initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (47%) were identified later by positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. There was a spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients: IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (74%), and both IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). Of the 99 cases, 51% were asymptomatic during the epidemic; 61% had ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT of the chest compared with 11.6% among uninfected patients (P < 0.001). Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and were more likely to be symptomatic than patients with another primary cause of kidney failure. LIMITATIONS: Possible false-positive and false-negative results for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations. CONCLUSIONS: Half the SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients receiving MHD were subclinical and were not identified by universal CT of the chest and selective NAT.

The most common laboratory abnormality associated with MS is increased intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the major antigenic targets of these antibody responses are unknown. The risk of MS is increased after infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to EBV infection, and MS patients have higher serum titers of anti-EBV antibodies than control populations. Our goal was to identify disease-relevant epitopes of IgG antibodies in MS; to do so, we screened phage-displayed random peptide libraries (12-mer) with total IgG antibodies purified from the brain of a patient with acute MS. We identified and characterized the phage peptides for binding specificity to intrathecal IgG from patients with MS and from controls by ELISA, phage-mediated Immuno-PCR, and isoelectric focusing. We identified two phage peptides that share sequence homologies with EBV nuclear antigens 1 and 2 (EBNA1 and EBNA2), respectively. The specificity of the EBV epitopes found by panning with MS brain IgG was confirmed by ELISA and competitive inhibition assays. Using a highly sensitive phage-mediated immuno-PCR assay, we determined specific bindings of the two EBV epitopes to IgG from CSF from 46 MS and 5 inflammatory control (IC) patients. MS CSF IgG have significantly higher bindings to EBNA1 epitope than to EBNA2 epitope, whereas EBNA1 and EBNA2 did not significantly differ in binding to IC CSF IgG.

Here, we report the development of what we believe to be a novel antigen-targeting DNA vaccine strategy that exploits the binding of programmed death-1 (PD1) to its ligands expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) by fusing soluble PD1 with HIV-1 GAG p24 antigen. As compared with non-DC-targeting vaccines, intramuscular immunization via electroporation (EP) of the fusion DNA in mice elicited consistently high frequencies of GAG-specific, broadly reactive, polyfunctional, long-lived, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and robust anti-GAG antibody titers. Vaccination conferred remarkable protection against mucosal challenge with vaccinia GAG viruses. Soluble PD1-based vaccination potentiated CD8+ T cell responses by enhancing antigen binding and uptake in DCs and activation in the draining lymph node. It also increased IL-12-producing DCs and engaged antigen cross-presentation when compared with anti-DEC205 antibody-mediated DC targeting. The high frequency of durable and protective GAG-specific CD8+ T cell immunity induced by soluble PD1-based vaccination suggests that PD1-based DNA vaccines could potentially be used against HIV-1 and other pathogens.","output":"PD1-based DNA vaccine amplifies HIV-1 GAG-specific CD8+ T cells in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research objective was to describe the levels of anxiety and their effects on performance manifested by the mathematics students of the engineering faculty of the National University of Chimborazo UNACH during the 2020-1 academic semester.

Bariatric surgery is one of the most efficient treatments of morbid obesity. The aims were to assess pancreatic endocrine and exocrine lesions in obese rats, to analyze effects of bariatric surgery. Sixty-three male Wistar rats were included in five groups: 2 fed with high fat diet (HFD) or normal diet for 3 months, 2 fed with HFD or normal diet for 6 months; 1 group fed with HFD and undergoing bariatric surgery (n = 30). Quantitative MR imaging was performed in HFD6, ND6 and HFD3-BS. Pancreas specimens were analyzed after sacrifice for adipocyte infiltration, fibrosis, acinar-ductal metaplasia, abnormality of Langerhans islets (HHF: hypertrophy, hypervascularisation, fibrosis), and hemosiderin deposits in acinar or endocrine locations. We found that HFD6 rats had more fibro-inflammatory islets (P = 0.0139) and acinar-ducal metaplasia (P = 0.0843) than HFD3 rats. Rats with HFD3+6 had more fibro-inflammatory islets (P < 0.0001), hemosiderin deposits (p < 0.0001), fat infiltration (P = 0.0008) and acinar-ductal metaplasia lesions (P = 0.0424). Weight increase was associated with glycoregulation abnormalities (r = 0.44, P = 0.08) and adipocyte infiltrations (P = 0.009). After surgery, less fibro-inflammatory islets (P = 0.0004), fat and iron infiltrates (P = 0.005 and P = 0.06), and acino-ductal metaplasia (P = 0.05) were observed compared to HFD6 rats. MR image quantifications revealed increased elasticity, fat fraction, and R2 and a decreased elasticity wave dispersion coefficient in the high fat groups that reversed after surgery. MRI parameters were in strong correlation with respective histological counterparts.

In this study, we introduced a global multi-scale place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a spatiotemporal-continuous and easy-to-implement measurement. The multi-scale PCI, demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10 percent penetration in the US population) and Facebook's social connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found that PCI has a strong boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity knowledge, exemplified with two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic and 2) modeling hurricane evacuation destination choice.

Nevertheless, few data are available regarding their force-generating capacities. The objective of this study was to provide a model of the force-length-activation relationships of the hand extensors using non-invasive methods. The extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) were studied as representative of wrist and finger extensors. Ten participants performed isometric extension force-varying contractions in different postures on an ergometer recording resultant moment. The joint angle, the myotendinous junction displacement and activation were synchronously tracked using motion capture, ultrasound and electromyography. Muscle force was estimated via a musculoskeletal model using the measured joint angle and moment. The force-length-activation relationship was then obtained by fitting a force-length model at different activation levels to the measured data. The obtained relationships agreed with previously reported data regarding muscle architecture, sarcomere length and activation-dependent shift of optimal length. Muscle forces estimated from kinematics and electromyography using the force-length-activation relationships were comparable, below 15% differences, to those estimated from moment via the musculoskeletal model. The obtained quantitative data provides a new insight into the different muscle mechanics of finger and wrist extensors.

The input is hot caustic washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes mainly originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, with no more than 5% PET from non-food consumer applications. The flakes are dried and crystallised in a first reactor, then extruded into pellets. These pellets are crystallised, preheated and treated in a solid-state polycondensation (SSP) reactor. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the drying and crystallisation (step 2), extrusion and crystallisation (step 3) and SSP (step 4) are critical in determining the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters to control the performance of these critical steps are temperature, air flow and residence time for the drying and crystallisation step, and temperature, pressure and residence time for the extrusion and crystallisation step as well as the SSP step. It was demonstrated that this recycling process is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below the conservatively modelled migration of 0.1 g/kg food. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the recycled PET obtained from this process is not of safety concern when used at up to 100% for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long-term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill.

To narrow the research-practice gap, we designed and evaluated the implementation of a community-delivered group-based functional power training (FPT) program for frail older adults within their neighbourhoods. Methods Two-arm, multicentre assessor-blind stratified randomised controlled trial at four local senior activity centres. Older adults ( n = 61) with low handgrip strength (HGS) were randomised to intervention (IG) or control (CG) group. The IG underwent the FPT program (power and balance exercises using simple equipments) delivered by a community provider. The 12-week program comprised 2  60 mins sessions/wk. CG continued usual activities at the centres. Functional performance (SPPB and TUG), HGS, knee extensor strength (KES), and frailty status were assessed at baseline and 3-month. Program implementation was evaluated using RE-AIM framework. Results The program was halted due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 related suspension of senior centre activities. Results are reported from four centres (n = 61), which completed the program. IG showed significant improvement of moderate effect sizes in frailty status (0.36 points, 95CI [0.09, 0.64], p = 0.011) and SPPB (0.51 points, 95CI [0.13, 0.89], p = 0.010). IG improvement in TUG (0.57 s, 95CI [-0.07, 1.20], p = 0.080) did not achieve significance and there were no effects for HGS and KES. Only SPPB showed greater improvement in IG than CG (p = 0.047).

We described six steps key to ensure a successful implementation which are the following: testing the feasibility and complexities of the entry process; establishing leadership and coordination of the project; developing patient-reported outcomes and experience measurements; developing and adapting the data recording and data analysis tools; piloting in one or more medical conditions and evaluating the results and project management. The implementation duration can vary depending on the complexity of the Medical Condition Clinical Process and Patient Pathways. However, we estimate that the implementing phase will last a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 24 months.

The C-terminus of nsp1 competes for the mRNA binding site in the 40S ribosome, preventing host translation from host mRNAs. Additionally, nsp1 triggers selective cleavage of host mRNAs while keeping the viral RNA intact. Nsp1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 84% sequence identity, prompting us to believe they share a similar mechanism of host shutoff. So far identification of nsp1-interacting partners has isolated stable complexes of nsp1 with the 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins. However, these complexes do not reveal any transient interaction nsp1 might have with other host proteins to suppress cellular function. Using proximity-dependent biotinylation to capture the transient interactions of nsp1 with other cellular proteins, we found multiple subunits of the nuclear pre-mRNA processing complex and cellular stress granule-associated proteins. Here, we show that nsp1 interacts with the majority of these pre-mRNA processing and stress granule-associated proteins through its C-terminal domain, the region responsible for binding the 40S ribosome. In addition, nsp1 co-immunoprecipitates with stress granule-associated protein G3BP1 and eIF4G. Upon induction of stress, these proteins accumulate in nonmembranous organelles called stress granules that are known to store stalled translation complexes. Using both immunofluorescence and immunoblot against stress granule-associated proteins we show that nsp1 disrupts the maturation of stress granules.","output":"Nonstructural Protein 1 of SARS Coronavirus Interacts with Stress Granule Protein G3BP1 and Accumulates in the Stress Granule."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Bacterial/fungal coinfection and superinfections contribute to the increased morbi-mortality of viral respiratory infections (RIs). The main objective of this study was to determine the incidence of these infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Method Retrospective observational study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 and bacterial/fungal infections at the Hospital Clnico Universitario of Valladolid, Spain (March 1-May 31, 2020). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were compared based on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and predictors of mortality by were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results Of the 712 COVID-19 patients, 113 (16%) presented bacterial/fungal coinfections or superinfections. Their median age was 73 years (IQR 57-89) and 59% were men. The profiles of ICU patients (44%) included male, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, leukocytosis, elevated inteleukin-6, with interferon -1b and tocilizumab and superinfection (p < 0.05). Coinfections were diagnosed in 5% (39/712) patients. Most common pathogens of respiratory coinfection (18) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (6) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Superinfections were detected in 11% (80/712) patients. Urinary (53) and RI (39) constituted the majority of superinfections Acinetobacter baumannii multidrug-resistant was the main agent of IR and bacteremia. An outbreak of A. baumannii contributed to this result. Three patients were considered to have probable pulmonary aspergillosis. Mortality was higher in UCI patients (50% vs. 29%, p = 0.028).

Persistent olfactory dysfunction is one of the commonest complaints reported in the condition colloquially known as long COVID (now known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)). The prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of long COVID olfactory dysfunction are not yet well understood. At present, the main stay of treatment is olfactory training. Quantitative olfactory testing and impacts on patient quality of life have not been widely studied. This study describes our experiences at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals, UK (WWL) of establishing a COVID-19 smell clinic, along with preliminary data on patient demographics, baseline smell test scores and quality of life questionnaire scores before olfactory training. METHODS: We piloted a COVID-19 smell clinic. We recorded patient demographics and clinical characteristics then performed clinical assessment of each patient. Quantitative measurements of olfactory dysfunction were recorded using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). We measured the impact of olfactory dysfunction on patient quality of life using the validated English Olfactory Disorders Questionnaire (eODQ). RESULTS: 20 patients participated in the clinic. 4 patients were excluded from analysis due to missing data. Median age was 35 years. 81% (n=13) of the participants were female. 50% (n=8) of patients suffered with a combination of anosmia/ageusia and parosmia, whilst 43% (n=7) of patients suffered with anosmia/ageusia without parosmia. Almost all the patients registered UPSIT scores in keeping with impaired olfaction. Patient scores ranged from 22 to 35, with the median score at 30. All patients reported that their olfactory dysfunction had an impact on their quality of life. The median eODQ score reported was 90, with scores ranging from 42 to 169 out of a maximum of 180. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that it is simple and feasible to set up a COVID-19 smell clinic. The materials are inexpensive, but supervised completion of the UPSIT and eODQ is time-consuming. Patients demonstrate reduced olfaction on quantitative testing and experience significant impacts on their quality of life as a result. More research is needed to demonstrate if olfactory training results in measurable improvements in smell test scores and quality of life.","output":"Implementing a COVID-19 specialist smell clinic: experience at the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals (WWL), NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, no effective treatment or preventive strategy for COVID-19 exists Medications targeting viral replication are under investigation but additional str","output":"COVID-19 and Iodide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media sites use content moderation to attempt to cultivate safe spaces with accurate information for their users.

Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions.

Health care workers (HCWs) have frequent and high-risk interactions with COVID-19 patients. We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine optimal testing strategies for screening HCWs to inform strategic decision-making in health care settings. METHODS: We modeled the number of new infections, quality-adjusted life years lost, and net costs related to six testing strategies including no tests. We applied our model to four strata of HCWs, defined by the presence and timing of symptoms. We conducted sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in inputs. RESULTS: When screening recently symptomatic HCWs, conducting only a PCR test is preferable; it saves costs and improves health outcomes in the first week post-symptom onset, and costs $83,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained in the second week post-symptom onset. When screening HCWs in the late clinical disease stage, none of the testing approaches is cost-effective and thus no testing is preferable, yielding $11 and 0.003 new infections per 10 HCWs. For screening asymptomatic HCWs, antigen testing is preferable to PCR testing due to its lower cost. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCR and antigen testing are beneficial strategies to identify infected HCWs and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health care settings. IgG testing clinical value depends on test timing and immunity characteristics, however is not cost-effective in a low prevalence setting.

Materials and Methods: This prospective single-center trial was part of the larger open Video Service project on telemedicine at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the University of Mnster. Patients requiring prenatal or prepregnancy counseling were included. A questionnaire was designed for the evaluation of patient satisfaction and filled in by both patient and health care provider at the end of the video consultation. Results: Of 80 eligible cases, 75 video consultations were carried out and data from the questionnaire were collected. Overall patient satisfaction was high (95%, 71/75) although technical problems occurred in 37% (29/75) of the appointments. Health care providers' satisfaction was equally high and in 88% (66/75) of cases, remote consultations avoided an in-house visit without effect on health care quality.

Demographic data, imaging reports at the time of listing and explant pathology were collected. Results 25 patients were included and none of them had pre-existing lung disease. Chest CT reports obtained at the time of transplant listing and post transplant lung explant reports were reviewed. Most common radiographic and explant features were traction bronchiectasis and NSIP pattern interstitial fibrosis, respectively. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the largest descriptive report on COVID 19 explants. Though NSIP pattern is the most common finding on explants, only 48% of patients had fibrosis on CT scan prior to listing. Hence, other findings reflective of end stage lung disease such as traction bronchiectasis, GGO's should be considered along with respiratory mechanics while assessing the need for lung transplant for COVID-19 ARDS.","output":"Radiographic and Histopathologic Lessons from COVID-19 Explants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Improvements in the treatment of patients with cancer largely depend on clinical trials comparing a new intervention with a previous standard of care. This is not different when it comes to improving adjuvant (postoperative) and neoadjuvant (preoperative) treatment for colorectal cancer. In clinical trials, there is usually a close collaboration between physicians and statisticians, and better and more reliable results can be obtained when such trials are designed, conducted and analyzed with attention to some important methodological issues. In this article, we provide a general review of useful methodological and statistical ideas that may help investigators and clinicians in their attempt to improve treatment results in colorectal cancer. ABSTRACT: The design of the best possible clinical trials of adjuvant interventions in colorectal cancer will entail the use of both time-tested and novel methods that allow efficient, reliable and patient-relevant therapeutic development. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to safely and expeditiously bring to clinical practice novel interventions that impact patient lives. In this paper, we discuss statistical aspects and provide suggestions to optimize trial design, data collection, study implementation, and the use of predictive biomarkers and endpoints in phase 3 trials of systemic adjuvant therapy. We also discuss the issues of collaboration and patient centricity, expecting that several novel agents with activity in the (neo)adjuvant therapy of colon and rectal cancers will become available in the near future.","output":"Statistical Considerations for Trials in Adjuvant Treatment of Colorectal Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 has a wide range of clinical spectrum from asymptomatic infection to severe infection resulting in death within a short time. Currently, it is known that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) does not only cause a respiratory tract infection but a more complicated disease that can lead to multiple system involvement including the liver. Herein, we evaluate the epidemiology, the impact of liver injury/ dysfunction on disease prognosis, the pathophysiological mechanisms and management of liver injury. More than one-fourth of the patients have abnormal liver function tests, mostly a mild-to-moderate liver dysfunction. Liver injury is significantly associated with a poor clinical outcome. Direct cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2, the immune response (cytokine storm), the complications related to the disease, and drugs used in the treatments are the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for liver injury. However, the exact mechanism is not yet clearly explained. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and entering the hepatocyte and cholangiocytes can cause cytotoxic effects on the liver. Excessive immune response has an important role in disease progression and causes acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failures accompanied by liver injury. Treatment drugs, particularly lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir and antibiotics are a frequent reason for liver injury. The possible reasons should be meticulously investigated and resolved.","output":"COVID-19 and the liver: A brief and core review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although people with schizophrenia (PSZ) exhibit robust and reliable deficits in working memory (WM) capacity, the neural processes that give rise to this impairment remain poorly understood. One reason for this lack of clarity is that most studies employ a single neural recording modality-each with strengths and weaknesses-with few examples of integrating results across modalities. To address this gap, we conducted a secondary analysis that combined data from an overlapping set of subjects in previously published electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that used nearly identical working memory tasks (visual change detection). The prior studies found similar patterns of results for both posterior parietal BOLD activation and suppression of the alpha frequency band within the EEG. Specifically, both signals exhibited abnormally shallow modulation as a function of the amount of information being stored in WM in PSZ. In the present study, both alpha suppression and posterior parietal BOLD activity increased as the number of items stored in WM increased. The magnitude of alpha suppression modulation was correlated with the magnitude of BOLD signal modulation in PSZ, but not in HCS. This finding suggests that the same illness-related biological processes constrain both alpha suppression and BOLD signal modulation as a function of WM storage in PSZ. The complementary strengths of these two techniques may thus combine to advance the identification of the processes underlying WM deficits in PSZ.","output":"Neural basis of the visual working memory deficit in schizophrenia: Merging evidence from fMRI and EEG"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A relative paucity of data exists regarding chest radiography (CXR) in diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) compared to computed tomography. We address the use of a strict pattern of CXR findings for COVID-19 diagnosis, specifically during early onset of symptoms with respect to patient age. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients under investigation for COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department during the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020 and had CXR within 1 week of symptoms. Only reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)Cpositive patients were included. Two board-certified radiologists, blinded to RT-PCR results, assessed 60 CXRs in consensus and assigned 1 of 3 patterns: characteristic, atypical, or negative. Atypical patterns were subdivided into more suspicious or less suspicious for COVID-19. Results: Sixty patients were included: 30 patients aged 52 to 88 years and 30 patients aged 19 to 48 years. Ninety-three percent of the older group demonstrated an abnormal CXR and were more likely to have characteristic and atypicalCmore suspicious findings in the first week after symptom onset than the younger group. The relationship between age and CXR findings was statistically significant ((2) [2, n=60]=15.70; P=0.00039). The relationship between negative and characteristic COVID-19 CXR findings between the 2 age cohorts was statistically significant with Fisher exact test resulting in a P value of 0.001. Conclusion: COVID-19 positive patients >50 years show earlier, characteristic patterns of statistically significant CXR changes than younger patients, suggesting that CXR is useful in the early diagnosis of infection.

This paper summarizes the data related to the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on human reproduction. Both the male and female reproductive tract express high levels of receptors and proteins needed for viral cell entry. There is presently no evidence that gametes are affected by the infection. Male fertility may be temporarily reduced due to inflammatory responses following infection. The endometrium is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 cell entry; however, it remains unclear whether this could alter receptivity and embryo implantation. Menstrual cycle changes were reported in women who experienced severe infection; however, they tended to be reversible. For couples undergoing assisted reproduction treatment, the pandemic led to a significant psychological burden, with changes in lifestyle that could directly affect the success of the treatment. Human reproduction societies recommend screening all patients prior to cycle initiation and avoiding treatment of women with severe comorbidities until the pandemic is under control. Finally, for pregnant women, it is expected that the infection is more severe in women in the third trimester and in those with comorbidities. Those who are symptomatic for SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to have increased rates of prematurity and intrapartum fetal distress than those who are asymptomatic. Vertical transmission cannot be completely ruled out, but neonatal infection rates are low. Vaccination appears to be safe and is indicated for use in pregnant and lactating women because the benefits outweigh the risks.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Human Reproduction: A Changing Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gambling is an inherently risky activity. New technologies have led to the development of new, online forms of gambling such as sports betting, with round the clock availability and accessibility. While young men have been identified as a group that may be particularly vulnerable to the harms associated with these new online products, few studies have qualitatively explored young mens perceptions of the risks associated with these products. Using concepts associated with the sociology of risk, this paper sought to explore the range of factors that may influence how 18C24 year old young Australian men conceptualise the risks associated with sports betting. METHODS: Using a critical qualitative inquiry approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with sixteen participants in Victoria, Australia, who engaged in sports betting at least monthly. The data interpreted for this study included questions relating to awareness of gambling, the contexts associated with early gambling experiences; the factors that influenced current gambling behaviours, and why they engaged in gambling. A reflexive approach to thematic analysis was used to interpreted themes from the data. RESULTS: Four key themes were constructed from the data relating to the factors that influenced risk perceptions. These included: 1) The role of early experiences, including exposure to gambling advertising in sport, and the gambling behaviours of social networks; 2) The influence of peer rivalry and competition, in which sports betting was used to form connections within and across peer groups; 3) The normalisation of gambling, including the embedding of gambling in everyday activities; and 4) The influence of perceptions of knowledge, skill, and control, including the belief that they could engage in responsible behaviours and stop gambling if they needed to. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that a range of factors may influence how young men conceptualise the risks and benefits associated with sports betting. Current public health strategies for gambling that focus on individual determinants and responsibility paradigms must be broadened to target the social and commercial factors that influence young mens attitudes towards, and engagement in sports betting.","output":"Young mens perceptions about the risks associated with sports betting: a critical qualitative inquiry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

These challenges represent barriers to delivering great values-based, patient-centered care. In this , we describe the care team-family communication experience in a large, open NeuroICU and a software communication tool, Medical Memory, which is intended improve the efficiency of delivering information. METHODS: Medical Memory (MM) is a smartphone or tablet software application that allows the delivery of HIPAA compliant recordings via email. Before implementing MM, the Neurocritical Care nursing staff was surveyed to quantitatively and qualitatively gauge perception of communication strengths, challenges, effectiveness, and processes. Simultaneously, MM virtual training sessions were completed within the Neurocritical care practice group and a structured video update was created. Patients' family members were identified (preferred email contacts) for receiving video updates with a goal of one message per day. Family members can provide feedback via a brief survey after viewing the message. RESULTS: The pre-implementation survey had a response rate of over 80% (N=83). Approximately half of the nurses report at least 3 calls a day spending more than 15-30 minutes giving care updates. Over a 3rd of respondents spent more than 45 minutes a day. Qualitatively, nursing staff feel that they play an important role in communication, but provider communication was often reported to be inadequate by family members. MM is currently in use with a post-implementation survey scheduled after a 12-month pilot period.

The aim of this study was to compare the impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders and after lockdown orders were lifted on substance use, mental health, and weight-related behaviors among a sample of post-BS adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified BS patients from one university-based obesity medicine clinic and two BS practices. An online non-anonymous survey was implemented in two phases: during lockdown (April 1CMay 31, 2020) and after lockdown orders were lifted (June 1, 2020CSeptember 30, 2020) to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemics impact on BS patients. RESULTS: A total of 189 (during lockdown=39, post-lockdown=150) participants (90.4% female, mean age 52.4 years, SD 11.1, 49.8% non-Hispanic White, 30.6% non-Hispanic Black, 16.1% Hispanic) participated. Lockdown participants were more likely to have sleep problems (74.3% vs. 56.1%, P=.039) and feel anxious (82.0% vs. 63.0%, P=.024) versus post-lockdown participants. A majority (83.4%) reported depression in both lockdown/post-lockdown.

Constant expiratory flow, as provided by the new flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) mode, was shown to improve lung recruitment. We hypothesized that lung aeration and respiratory mechanics improve in obese patients during FCV. METHODS: We compared FCV and volume-controlled (VCV) ventilation in 23 obese patients in a randomized crossover setting. Starting with baseline measurements, ventilation settings were kept identical except for the ventilation mode related differences (VCV: inspiration to expiration ratio 1:2 with passive expiration, FCV: inspiration to expiration ratio 1:1 with active, linearized expiration). Primary endpoint of the study was the change of end-expiratory lung volume compared to baseline ventilation. Secondary endpoints were the change of mean lung volume, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamic variables. RESULTS: The loss of end-expiratory lung volume and mean lung volume compared to baseline was lower during FCV compared to VCV (end-expiratory lung volume: FCV, ? 126  207 ml; VCV, ? 316  254 ml; p < 0.001, mean lung volume: FCV, ? 108.2  198.6 ml; VCV, ? 315.8  252.1 ml; p < 0.001) and at comparable plateau pressure (baseline, 19.6  3.7; VCV, 20.2  3.4; FCV, 20.2  3.8 cmH(2)O; p = 0.441), mean tracheal pressure was higher (baseline, 13.1  1.1; VCV, 12.9  1.2; FCV, 14.8  2.2 cmH(2)O; p < 0.001). All other respiratory and hemodynamic variables were comparable between the ventilation modes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, compared to VCV, FCV improves regional ventilation distribution of the lung at comparable PEEP, tidal volume, P(Plat) and ventilation frequency. The increase in end-expiratory lung volume during FCV was probably caused by the increased mean tracheal pressure which can be attributed to the linearized expiratory pressure decline.

The consequence of that has been a heightened level of anxiety among humans and opting for unorthodox consumption behaviors as consumers. In this study the attempt was to analyze human behaviors during the ongoing pandemic process from the perspective of psychology and marketing fields of science. In so doing, interrelation among anxiety, which surfaced because of Covid-19 pandemic, coping style with stress of individuals and compulsive purchase behavior has been explored. Based on these interrelations, a structural model was suggested. Findings of the research indicated that anxiety has high effect on the helpless approach dimension, which is one of the coping styles with stress; and that helpless approach alone has an effect on compulsive buying behavior. Besides, another objective of the study was to evaluate the mediating effect of intolerance of uncertainty between coping style with stress and compulsive buying behavior. That analysis evidenced that intolerance of uncertainty in such an interrelation had a partial mediating effect.","output":"Mediating effect of intolerance of uncertainty in the relationship between coping styles with stress during pandemic (COVID-19) process and compulsive buying behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In FRESCO (Fruquintinib Efficacy and Safety in 3+ Line Colorectal Cancer Patients) trial, fruquintinib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit in Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, its safety profile, including adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), is not well known. The present analysis evaluated the safety profile and AESIs for fruquintinib in the FRESCO trial. METHODS In FRESCO, eligible Chinese patients were randomized (2:1) to receive fruquintinib (5 mg once daily for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off in 28-day cycles) or placebo plus best supportive care. Treatment-related AESIs and time to first occurrence of AESIs were summarized. Treatment-related TEAEs by age, sex, and BMI were also summarized. RESULTS A total of 266 patients (95.7%) in the fruquintinib group and 97 (70.8%) in the placebo group had at least one treatment-related TEAE; the mean relative dose intensity was 92% and 98%, respectively. In the fruquintinib group, the most common (in > 40% of patients) treatment-related AESIs were hypertension (55.4%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome [known as hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR)] (49.3%), and proteinuria (42.1%). The most common treatment-related grade  3 AESIs ( 3% of patients) were hypertension (21.2%), HFSR (10.8%), and proteinuria (3.2%); the median time to onset of these events was 10, 21, and 20 days, respectively. Subgroup analysis by age, sex, and BMI revealed that the frequencies of treatment-related TEAEs were similar across all subgroups, and were consistent with the overall safety profile of fruquintinib. CONCLUSIONS The most common treatment-related grade  3 AEs were hypertension, HFSR, and proteinuria. The treatment-related TEAE profile of fruquintinib in Chinese patents with mCRC was comparable among different subgroups and consistent with that reported in the overall population.

Existing studies typically examine whether mobility in specific localities increases or decreases at specific points in time and relate these changes to certain pandemic and policy events. However, a more comprehensive analysis of mobility change over time is needed. In this paper, we study mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility footprint data. (Step 1) Propose the Delta Time Spent in Public Places (TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each US county from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent components of change in mobility. (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find counties that exhibit similar latent components. (Step 4) Investigate local and global spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct correlation analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior correlate with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county as a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of the variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in mobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. Furthermore, we find that US counties that are geographically close are more likely to exhibit a similar change in mobility. Finally, we observe significant correlations between the three latent components of mobility change and various population characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and unemployment. We find that our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of mobility change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Change of human mobility during COVID-19: A United States case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top ten causes of death globally, despite being treatable. The eradication of TB disease requires, amongst others, diagnostic tests with high specificity and sensitivity that will work at the point of care (POC) in low-resource settings.

MVN binds to ManLAM with sub-picomolar binding affinity, but does not bind to other variants of LAM expressed by non-pathogenic mycobacteria - a level of binding specificity and affinity that current commercially available anti-LAM antibodies cannot achieve. An on-bead ELISA was subsequently developed using MVN-functionalized magnetic beads which allows for the specific capture of ManLAM from human urine with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.14 ng mL-1 and no cross-reactivity when tested with PILAM, a variant of LAM found on non-pathogenic mycobacteria.","output":"The cyanobacterial lectin, microvirin-N, enhances the specificity and sensitivity of lipoarabinomannan-based TB diagnostic tests."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contrary to the Great and other past U.S. Recessions, the reduction in services consumption exceeds the decline in nondurables consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As SARS-CoV-2 has the potentiality of leading to life-threatening respiratory failure, its transmission routes need to be characterized. Yet, the possibility of airborne transmission is still debated. This study was performed to evaluate potential hospital indoor air viral quality in order to detect SARS-COV-2. For this purpose, an impinger method was used to monitor the SARS-COV-2 virus in the air. Thus, 33 samples were collected from 8 different hospital locations. The sampling time was between 50 and 60 min with a sampling flow rate of 28 L/min. Air samples were taken from 2 to 5 m away from the patients' beds. Temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration were 28, 37, and 438 ppm, respectively. The results indicated that air samples which were 2 to 5 m away from the patients' beds were negative for the presence of the virus. According to the obtained results, it is suggested that airborne transmission may not have much effect on this pandemic. However, as the patients with SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized in rooms with negative air pressure, the results might have been negatively affected.

Health interventions with these aims have received more attention from a clinical effectiveness perspective than for cost impact and economic efficiency. METHODS: We collected data on resource use and costs as part of a large, multi-country study assessing the use of routine antenatal screening ultrasound (US) with the aim of considering the implications for economic efficiency. We assessed typical antenatal outpatient and hospital-based (facility) care for pregnant women, in general, with selective complication-related data collection in women participating in a large maternal health registry and clinical trial in five LMICs. We estimated average costs from a facility/health system perspective for outpatient and inpatient services. We converted all country-level currency cost estimates to 2015 United States dollars (USD). We compared average costs across countries for ANC visits, deliveries, higher-risk pregnancies, and complications, and conducted sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Our study included sites in five countries representing different regions. Overall, the relative cost of individual ANC and delivery-related healthcare use was consistent among countries, generally corresponding to country-specific income levels. ANC outpatient visit cost estimates per patient among countries ranged from 15 to 30 USD, based on average counts for visits with and without US. Estimates for antenatal screening US visits were more costly than non-US visits. Costs associated with higher-risk pregnancies were influenced by rates of hospital delivery by cesarean section (mean per person delivery cost estimate range: 25C65 USD). CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial differences among countries in infrastructures and health system capacity, there were similarities in resource allocation, delivery location, and country-level challenges. Overall, there was no clear suggestion that adding antenatal screening US would result in either major cost savings or major cost increases. However, antenatal screening US would have higher training and maintenance costs. Given the lack of clinical effectiveness evidence and greater resource constraints of LMICs, it is unlikely that introducing antenatal screening US would be economically efficient in these settings--on the demand side (i.e., patients) or supply side (i.e., healthcare providers).

Only two of eight naturally occurring polymorphic Tp9 epitopes were recognized by both CTLs. Finally, using a TCR avidity assay, we found that a higher TCR avidity was associated with a stronger functional response toward one of two variants recognized by the CTL.

The purpose of this study was to examine changes in vaccine intentions and attitudes by sociodemographic characteristics and geographic areas, factors associated with vaccination intent, and reasons for non-vaccination among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. METHODS: Data from six waves of the Household Pulse Survey (6 January C 29 March 2021) were analyzed. Differences between January and March were assessed using t-tests. Factors associated with vaccination intent were examined in multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: From early January to late March, vaccination receipt of 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or intention to definitely get vaccinated increased from 54.7 to 72.3%; however, disparities in vaccination intent continued to exist by age group, race/ethnic groups, and socioeconomic characteristics. Vaccine receipt and the intent were the lowest for region 4 (southeastern U.S.) throughout this period. Adults who had a previous COVID-19 diagnosis or were unsure if they have had COVID-19 were less likely to intend to get vaccinated [prevalence ratio = 0.92 (95%CI: 0.90C0.93) and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.74C0.85), respectively]. The belief that a vaccine is not needed increased by more than five percentage points from early January to late March. CONCLUSION: Intent to definitely get a COVID-19 vaccine increased by almost 18 percentage points from early January to late March; however, younger adults, adults who are non-Hispanic Black or other races, adults of lower socioeconomic status, and adults living in the southeastern U.S. region (Region 4) continue to have higher coverage gaps and levels of vaccine hesitancy. Emphasizing the importance of vaccination among all populations, and removing barriers to vaccines, may lead to a reduction of COVID-19 incidence and bring an end to the pandemic.

In particular, the paper focuses on the analysis of relative search volumes (RSVs) quantifying their dependence on the day they are collected. Methods: RSVs of the query coronavirus + covid during February 1 - December 4, 2020 (period 1), and February 20 - May 18, 2020 (period 2), were collected daily by Google Trends from December 8 to 27, 2020. The survey covered Italian regions and cities, and countries and cities worldwide. The search category was set to all categories. Each dataset was analyzed to observe any dependencies of RSVs from the day they were gathered. To do this, by calling i the country, region, or city under investigation and j the day its RSV was collected, a Gaussian distribution X_i=X({sigma}_i,x_i) was used to represent the trend of daily variations of x_ij=RSVs_ij. When a missing value was revealed (anomaly), the affected country, region or city was excluded from the analysis. When the anomalies exceeded 20% of the sample size, the whole sample was excluded from the statistical analysis. Pearson and Spearman correlations between RSVs and the number of COVID-19 cases were calculated day by day thus to highlight any variations related to the day RSVs were collected. Student t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between the average RSVs of the various countries, regions, or cities of a given dataset. Two RSVs were considered statistical confident when t<1.5. A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded 20% (confidence threshold). The percentage increase {Delta} was used to quantify the difference between two values. Results: Google Trends has been subject to an acceptable quantity of anomalies only as regards the RSVs of Italian regions (0% in both period 1 and period 2) and countries worldwide (9.7% during period 1 and 10.9% during period 2). However, the correlations between RSVs and COVID-19 cases underwent significant variations even in these two datasets (Max |{Delta}| = +625% for Italian regions, and Max |{Delta}| = +175% for countries worldwide). Furthermore, only RSVs of countries worldwide did not exceed confidence threshold. Finally, the large amount of anomalies registered in Italian and international cities' RSVs made these datasets unusable for any kind of statistical inference. Conclusions: In the considered timespans, Google Trends has proved to be reliable only for surveys concerning RSVs of countries worldwide. Since RSVs values showed a high dependence on the day they were gathered, it is essential for future research that the authors collect queries' data for several consecutive days and work with their RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the standard errors until an established confidence threshold is respected.","output":"Reliability of Google Trends: Analysis of the Limits and Potential of Web Infoveillance During COVID-19 Pandemic and for Future Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new coronavirus-strain from a zoonotic reservoir (probably bat)-termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-has recently claimed more than two million deaths worldwide.

Snowball search was also conducted on Google Scholar and the reference list of selected studies was checked to identify additional studies. Articles published from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 to September 2020 were considered for inclusion. Results: Three types of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers were identified including pre-symptomatic cases, asymptomatic carriers with normal chest radiographs and asymptomatic carriers with abnormal chest radiographs. Pre-symptomatic cases are older and have abnormal chest radiograph and abnormal biochemical parameters including abnormal white blood cell and lymphocyte counts at the time of diagnosis compared to those who remain asymptomatic. Asymptomatic carriers with normal chest CT images constitute about one-third of all asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. They are younger and have normal biochemical parameters at the time of diagnosis. Asymptomatic patients with abnormal chest radiograph represent about two-thirds of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. Limited data indicate that asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission is possible. Asymptomatic transmission has been reported among familial contacts of carriers. Asymptomatic transmission occur in both cases with normal and abnormal chest radiograph as well as those who have no obvious changes in biochemical parameters.

These patients suffered from leukemia (n = 16), lymphoma (n = 3), solid tumors (n = 10), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (n = 1). RESULTS: The course of the disease was mild in all cases, with only 12 children developing symptoms (pneumonia in 3 cases), and none needing intensive care.

Like most members of this family, the virus is composed of structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs). The non-structural proteins are critical elements of the replication and transcription complex (RTC), as well as immune system evasion. Through hijacking the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, NSPs help the virus establish the RTC, inducing ER stress after membrane rearrangement and causing severe neuronal disturbance. In this review, we focus on the role of Nsp3, 4, and 6 in intracellular membrane rearrangement and evaluate the potential disruption of the central nervous system and the neurodegeneration which it could trigger. Studies of these NSPs will not only bring to light their specific role in viral infection but also facilitate the discovery of novel targeted drugs.","output":"Why do SARS-CoV-2 NSPs rush to the ER?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States, uninsurance remains a major barrier in accessing health care for many citizens and residents.

Virion-antibody-colloidal gold complexes were, in fact, endocytosed by synchronously infected cells. These complexes were apparently non-infectious, and they accumulated in vacuoles that resembled secondary lysosomes. Exposure of cells to ammonium chloride or to methylamine during the first hour of infection had little inhibitory effect on the production of infectious virus. Chloroquine treatments were inhibitory but this effect depended on relatively late events in the infectious process. The chloroquine inhibitory step blocked infection of virus adsorbed to cells that were exposed to buffers in the pH range of 4.4 to 8.4. These findings indicate that BCV penetrates its host cell by direct fusion with the plasmalemma and does not require an acidic intracellular compartment for infectious entry.","output":"Initial events in bovine coronavirus infection: analysis through immunogold probes and lysosomotropic inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed many knowledge gaps with implications toward the speed and nature of our response to contain, assess and mitigate risk.

Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was responsible for the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is now considered as a pandemic. The prevention strategies adopted have included social distancing measures and the modification, reduction or interruption of a large proportion of routine healthcare activity. This has had a significant impact on the care provided in Gastrointestinal Motility Units. Having passed the peak, in terms of mortality and infections, a gradual reduction in transmission figures has been observed in Spain and other European countries. The risk of reactivation, however, remains high, so it is necessary to have a plan in place that allows healthcare centres to safely resume, for their patients and professionals, instrumental examinations linked to the management of motor pathology. Based on the available scientific evidence and the consensus of a panel of experts, the Spanish Association of Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ASENEM) has drawn up a series of practical recommendations, which have been adapted to the risks inherent in each activity. These include individual protection proposals, as well as organisational and structural measures, which are conceived to allow for the gradual resumption of examinations while minimising the possibility of contagion.","output":"RECOMENDACIONES DE LA ASOCIACIN ESPA?OLA DE NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGIA Y MOTILIDAD (ASENEM) PARA EL REINICIO DE LA ACTIVIDAD DE LOS LABORATORIOS DE MOTILIDAD DIGESTIVA, TRAS EL CONFINAMIENTO POR EL ESTADO DE ALARMA DECRETADO A RAIZ DE LA PANDEMIA POR COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify and describe different types of lifestyle interventions primarily or secondarily focused on weight loss in SLE patients.

Infected patients require laboratory follow-up to assist in clinical and therapeutic management. It is important to define efficient parameters to predict the clinical course of the disease, especially when the overall symptoms are becoming worse, in an attempt to anticipate therapeutic measures and to ensure the most appropriate assistance. Purpose To correlate neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and their subtypes with the severity and outcome of patients with Covid-19. Materials and methods Patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19, of both genders and without evidence of bacterial pneumonia, seen at the CHC-UFPR between April and June 2020, were included. Lymphocyte subpopulation analysis was performed by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) on whole blood sample using antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19. A BD FACSCanto? II cytometer and Infinicyt? 2.0 analysis software were used. ROC curve and other statistical relationships were performed with IBM SPSS? v. 25 software. Results Patients were divided as moderate (not intubated, n = 41) and severe (intubated, n = 35). From the median total leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and their subsets, we define the cutoff values with the highest correlation with hospital discharge. Patients with lymphocyte counts higher than 489/L, CD4 counts higher than 326 and CD8 counts higher than 121 had a greater chance of evolving with a better prognosis (p < 0.001). Patients who had neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) higher than 15.2 showed greater correlation with worse prognosis. Patients with lymphopenia below cutoff values are 40 to 55% more likely to be intubated and 50 to 63% to progress to death. Patients with NLR higher than 15.2 have 53.1% more chances of being intubated and 78.1% of evolving to death. Discussion Laboratory evaluation is essential in the follow-up of patients with Covid-19. In addition to routinely used biochemical markers, cellular analysis can provide valuable information about the clinic and its progression. Lymphopenia and neutrophilia are common parameters in patients with severe disease, so NLR analysis presents itself as an objective scale for stratification of infected patients with a high correlation with possible outcomes. Associated with this, assessment of the immune profile with low levels of T-cells and especially low levels of positive CD4 cells has been associated with worse prognosis in patients with severe Covid-19. Conclusion We conclude that analysis of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio routinely obtained from the complete blood count may provide relevant prognostic information for patients with Covid-19. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes can complement the screening of patients with Covid-19 by providing information on the immune profile of the disease.","output":"LABORATORY MARKERS FOR PREDICTING AGGRAVATION AND POOR PROGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the WHO announced that Covid-19 had become a global pandemic, online pharmacies have emerged as an extremely popular way to purchase medication due to the quarantine measures introduced by numerous countries to prevent the virus's spread.

Materials and Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients consecutively admitted to a single quaternary care center from March 27 to April 10, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Abdominal imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed, and salient findings were recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Univariable analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results A total of 412 patients (average age, 57 years; range, 18 to >90 years; 241 men, 171 women) were evaluated. A total of 224 abdominal imaging studies were performed (radiography, n = 137; US, n = 44; CT, n = 42; MRI, n = 1) in 134 patients (33%). Abdominal imaging was associated with age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year of increase; P = .001) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR, 17.3; P < .001). Bowel-wall abnormalities were seen on 31% of CT images (13 of 42) and were associated with ICU admission (OR, 15.5; P = .01). Bowel findings included pneumatosis or portal venous gas, seen on 20% of CT images obtained in patients in the ICU (four of 20). Surgical correlation (n = 4) revealed unusual yellow discoloration of the bowel (n = 3) and bowel infarction (n = 2).

Cloud bases measured by ceilometer in Delhi, the capital of India, are observed to propagate from low level to higher levels as the lockdown progresses. It is explained in terms of trends in temporal variation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and precursor gases to secondary hygroscopic aerosols. The large reduction (47%) in CCN estimated from aerosol extinction coefficient during the lockdown results in upward shift of cloud bases. Low clouds with bases located below 3 km are found to have reduced significantly from 63% (of total clouds distributed in the vertical) during pre-lockdown to 12% in lockdown period (less polluted). Cloud base height is found to have an inverse correlation with CCN (r = -0.64) and NO2/NH3 concentrations (r = -0.7).

Postoperative assessment consists of physical measurement of uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume, but health systems worldwide have experienced pressures in demand, leading to exploration of greater efficiency in organizing clinic protocols. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire measurement has been identified as a tool to predict change in postoperative management. Our institution established a nurse-led follow-up virtual clinic (VC) for patients undergoing BOO surgery based on IPSS measurement. We present the clinical and economic outcomes of this new service. Materials and Methods: Patients with a successful postoperative trial without catheter were contacted by telephone via VC and discharged by a Urology Clinical Nurse Specialist (UCNS) if IPSS was <8. Data were analyzed for IPSS, arrangement of subsequent clinic visits, and numbers discharged. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients discharged after VC consultation. Secondary outcomes were overall discharge rate following subsequent face-to-face (FTF) appointment; and the proportion of patients re-referred from Primary Care within 3 months of discharge from VC. Cost savings were calculated based on tariffs of 135 for first attendance with UCNS, 199 for uroflowmetry, and 47.84 for VC appointment. Results: The first 50 patients to be recipients of the new VC were included. The median IPSS and quality-of-life score were 13 (interquartile range [IQR] 5) and 3 (IQR 1), respectively. Thirty-nine (78%) patients were discharged from VC; 36 (72%) had IPSS <8. Overall discharge rate following subsequent FTF appointment was 88%. Two patients discharged from VC (5.1%) were subsequently re-referred, neither of whom required additional treatment. Total cost savings with VC amounted to 10,634.

We establish that TLR7 sensing in pDC and chemotaxis are both required for pDC arrest and functional clustering with CD169+ MP in the BM. Lastly, we demonstrate that STING-sensing in CD169+ MP control pDC initiation of type I IFN production while also regulating pDC clustering and egress from the BM. Collectively, these results link pDC acquisition of type I IFN secreting capacity with changes in their motility, homing and interactions with CD169+ MP during infection. Thus, targeting this cellular interaction may help modulate type I IFN to improve outcomes of microbial infections and autoimmune diseases.","output":"CD169+ macrophages orchestrate plasmacytoid dendritic cell arrest and retention for optimal priming in the bone marrow of malaria-infected mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: The new beta-coronavirus, which caused Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), a major respiratory outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is now prevalent in many countries around the world Identifying PCR-based viruses is a well-known and relatively stable protocol Unfortunately, the high mutation rates may lead to widespread changes in viral nucleic acid sequences, and so using specific primers for PCR can be recom-mended In this study, we evaluated the power of a conventional RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA among the five set primer sets Materials and Methods: The five genomic regions of the Coronavirus SARS-2 virus including Nucleocapsids (N), Enve-lope (E), RNA depended RNA Polymerase (RdRp), ORF1ab and Spike (S) were selected for primer designing A conventional RT-PCR was performed to compare sensitivity, specificity and other analytical characteristics of primers designed against two Real Time PCR commercial kits Results: The result of the comparative analysis showed that the ORF1ab, N and RdRp primers had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value higher than other primers A significant difference in the analytical sensitivity between the studied primer sets in RT-PCR kits was observed Conclusion: In this study, the ORF1ab, Nucleocapsid and RdRp regions have the best primers for identifying the SARS-CoV-2 RNA between different genes that have been suggested","output":"Comparison five primer sets from different genome region of covid-1for detection of virus infection by conventional rt-pcr"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The aim of this study was to see whether or not this may affect overall survival (OS) and disease\\\\free survival (DFS). METHOD: A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189158). Medline, EMBASE and Scopus were interrogated. Patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer who received elective surgery as their primary treatment were included. Delay to elective surgery was defined as the period between CRC diagnosis and the day of surgery. Meta\\\\analysis of the outcomes OS and DFS were conducted. Forest plots, funnel plots and tests of heterogeneity were produced. An estimated number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant pooled hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Of 3753 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria. Encompassing 314 560 patients, three of the seven studies showed that a delay to elective resection is associated with poorer OS or DFS. OS was assessed at a 1 month delay, the HR for six datasets was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02C1.26, p = 0.020) and at 3 months the pooled HR for three datasets was 1.57 (95% CI 1.16C2.12, p = 0.004). The estimated NNH for a delay at 1 month and 3 months was 35 and 10 respectively. Delay was nonsignificantly negatively associated with DFS on meta\\\\analysis. CONCLUSION: This review recommends that elective surgery for CRC patients is not postponed longer than 4 weeks, as available evidence suggests extended delays from diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes.

POCUS has been shown to be a safe modality for imaging patients in highly infectious settings such as Ebola, but there is limited published data on the safety and feasibility of POCUS use during periods of ICU strain in the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe our experience with POCUS in a hospital in New York City from March to May, 2020. Methods: POCUS was performed and interpreted by a competent critical care attending or fellow and primarily performed during the initial daily bedside assessment to limit number of entries and minimize exposure. POCUS exams were performed based on clinical indication and operators were encouraged to archive videos and images for documentation. Appropriate infection control procedures were followed, including hand sterilization, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (disposable gown, gloves, N95 mask, eye shield) when entering a negative pressure room. Ultrasound machines were cleaned twice with hydrogen peroxide, both prior to and after exiting the room. We also evaluated the exposure to our intensivists after May 30th to evaluate for nosocomial transmission by means of COVID-19 antibody testing. Results: We were able to secure a dedicated portable ultrasound machine for each ICU, including newly opened surge ICUs. The consult service used a handheld ultrasound machine. Eighty-eight critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease had archived POCUS exams during this period. These patients had a median of 2 (range, 1-10) POCUS exams archived during their hospitalization. Infection control protocols were followed and a survey of all intensivists who performed said POCUS exams revealed that there was no known transmission of SARS-CoV2. Conclusions: We describe the practical aspects of incorporating POCUS in a safe and feasible manner in a critical care setting during a period of extreme strain and complex infection control requirements. Utilization of POCUS likely limited the need for further studies that might have increased risk of exposure to other healthcare personnel. There are limitations to this study, including barriers to archiving and documenting POCUS findings, likely due to operator error, time limitation, and technical issues with the machine or network connectivity. Future studies should focus on identifying barriers to POCUS archiving and documentation, description of clinical indications, findings, and change in management, if any.","output":"Safety and feasibility of performing pocus during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has killed more than a million people worldwide, and researchers are constantly working to develop therapeutics in the treatment and prevention of this new viral infection. To infect and induced pathogenesis as observed in other viral infections, we postulated that SARS-CoV-2 may also require an escalation in the anabolic metabolism, such as glucose and glutamine, to support its energy and biosynthetic requirements during the infection cycle. Recently, the requirement of altered glucose metabolism in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis was demonstrated, but the role of dysregulated glutamine metabolism is not yet mentioned for its infection. In this perspective, we have attempted to provide a summary of possible biochemical events on putative metabolic reprograming of glutamine in host cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparison to other viral infections/cancer metabolism and available clinical data or research on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

The CAFG therefore re-convened to examine this literature and update practice recommendations. This second of two articles addresses airway evaluation, decision-making, and safe implementation of an airway management strategy when difficulty is anticipated. SOURCE: Canadian Airway Focus Group members, including anesthesia, emergency medicine, and critical care physicians were assigned topics to search. Searches were run in the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL databases. Results were presented to the group and discussed during video conferences every two weeks from April 2018 to July 2020. These CAFG recommendations are based on the best available published evidence. Where high-quality evidence is lacking, statements are based on group consensus. FINDINGS AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Prior to airway management, a documented strategy should be formulated for every patient, based on airway evaluation. Bedside examination should seek predictors of difficulty with face-mask ventilation (FMV), tracheal intubation using video- or direct laryngoscopy (VL or DL), supraglottic airway use, as well as emergency front of neck airway access. Patient physiology and contextual issues should also be assessed. Predicted difficulty should prompt careful decision-making on how most safely to proceed with airway management. Awake tracheal intubation may provide an extra margin of safety when impossible VL or DL is predicted, when difficulty is predicted with more than one mode of airway management (e.g., tracheal intubation and FMV), or when predicted difficulty coincides with significant physiologic or contextual issues. If managing the patient after the induction of general anesthesia despite predicted difficulty, team briefing should include triggers for moving from one technique to the next, expert assistance should be sourced, and required equipment should be present. Unanticipated difficulty with airway management can always occur, so the airway manager should have a strategy for difficulty occurring in every patient, and the institution must make difficult airway equipment readily available. Tracheal extubation of the at-risk patient must also be carefully planned, including assessment of the patients tolerance for withdrawal of airway support and whether re-intubation might be difficult.","output":"Canadian Airway Focus Group updated consensus-based recommendations for management of the difficult airway: part 2.

Objective: To determine the efficacy of 5 or 10 days of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care on clinical status on day 11 after initiation of treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen saturation >94%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group. Results: Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years; 227 [39%] women; 56% had cardiovascular disease, 42% hypertension, and 40% diabetes), and 533 (91%) completed the trial. Median length of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the 10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1%) in the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2%) in the standard care group. Nausea (10% vs 3%), hypokalemia (6% vs 2%), and headache (5% vs 3%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with standard care. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the current literature on the use of saliva test for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and carry out a meta-analysis to determine its diagnostic accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective studies were searched for in electronic databases, complemented by hand-searching relevant journals. The risk of bias and applicability were assessed using the revised Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Meta-analyses and meta-regression modeling were performed to calculate the diagnostic accuracy and examine sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included with 2928 paired samples. The overall meta-analysis showed a high sensitivity and specificity for saliva test at 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.92) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.75-0.98), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was calculated at 87 (95% CI 19-395) and area under the curve was calculated as 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94) suggesting very good performance of the saliva tests in detecting SARS-CoV-2.

In this stressful situation, the question arises as to what mechanisms distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive self-regulation. The theory of Motivated Cue-Integration (MCI) is a novel theory of self-regulation that provides a new perspective on the effect of COVID-19 on self-regulation deficiency as an example of psychological distress. Inspired by predictive coding, social cognition, embodied cognition, and experiential approach, MCI suggests that self-regulation is based on interaction between (1) high-level values and goals, (2) low-level interoceptive and exteroceptive signals, and (3) trust in epistemic authority or a significant other. Motivated Cue-Integration posits that individuals create meaning by making moment-to-moment predictions that affect their interpretation of the experience of ambiguity influenced by their relationship with epistemic authority. According to MCI, deficiency in self-regulation during COVID-19 could result either from over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to low-level interoceptive and exteroceptive cues; rigidity or ambiguity of high-level goals, poor integration between the two levels of processing as well as distrust in epistemic authority. According to MCI, variations of these deficiencies may occur in various clinical phenomena such as alexithymia and somatization, as well as in social phenomena such as goal radicalization. Based on this reasoning, MCI claims that the mentalization of the relationship between interoceptive cues, exteroceptive cues, goals, and psychological needs of the person, as well as the improvement of confidence in epistemic authority, can promote adaptive self-regulation. Psychological intervention can foster trust in epistemic authority, increase the mentalization of interoceptive and exteroceptive cues, and their association with adaptive goals. As such, the integration of these elements in a way that facilitates incentives pathways and insight fosters a more integrated subjective experience, higher clarity of emotion, and positive internal dialogue which promotes action tendency.","output":"Theory of Motivated Cue-Integration and COVID-19: Between Interoception, Somatization, and Radicalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has contaminated millions of people, resulting in high fatality rates. Recently emerging artificial intelligence technologies like the convolutional neural network (CNN) are strengthening the power of imaging tools and can help medical specialists. CNN combined with other sensors creates a new solution to fight COVID-19 transmission. This paper presents a novel method to detect coughs (an important symptom of COVID-19) using a K-band continuous-wave Doppler radar with most popular CNNs architectures: AlexNet, VGG-19, and GoogLeNet. The proposed method has cough detection test accuracy of 88.0% using AlexNet CNN with people 1 m away from the microwave radar sensor, test accuracy of 80.0% with people 3 m away from the radar sensor, and test accuracy of 86.5% with a single mixed dataset with people 1 m and 3 m away from the radar sensor. The K-band radar sensor is inexpensive, completely camera-free and collects no personally-identifying information, allaying privacy concerns while still providing in-depth public health data on individual, local, and national levels.

In addition to their participation in physiological hemostasis, platelet aggregates are also involved in pathological thrombosis and play an important role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify. Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type. It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists. The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.","output":"Intelligent classification of platelet aggregates by agonist type"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To explore the effects of short-term low- to moderate- dose glucocorticoids on the immune-inflammatory indicators and 28-d prognoses of patients with regular or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: : The clinical data and laboratorial examination results of 66 patients with regular or severe type of COVID-19 that treated in Henan Provincial Peoples Hospital and Nanyang Central Hospital between January 20 and February 14, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Here, 36 patients that had been treated with glucocorticoids were categorized in the glucocorticoids group (GC group), while the other 30 patients that had not been treated with glucocorticoids were categorized in the control group. Results: : The immune-inflammatory indicators and prognoses of the patients in the two groups were compared. The sex, age, clinical types, and complications were not significantly different between the two groups (all P> 0.05). After hospitalization, 33.3% and 6.7% of the patients in the GC group and control group were with chest distress, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant ( P= 0.019). The duration of fever was also significantly different between the two groups (6.91  4.41 vs. 9.21  4.46 days, P= 0.036), but the blood examination results within 24 h after hospitalization were not significantly different between the two groups (all P> 0.05). The C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were lower in the GC group than control group on day 7 ( P= 0.012, P= 0.035) but were not significantly different between the two groups on day 14.

As of 2016, the development of a novel drug candidate required up to $ USD 2.6 billion in investment for only 10% rate of approval by the FDA. To help decreasing the costs associated with the process, a number of in silico approaches have been developed with relatively low success due to limited predicting performance. Here, we introduced a machine learning-based algorithm as an alternative for a more accurate search of new pharmacological candidates, which takes advantage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for active molecule prediction within large databases. Our approach, termed PharmaNet was implemented here to search for ligands against specific cell receptors within 102 targets of the DUD-E database, which contains 22886 active molecules. PharmaNet comprises three main phases. First, a SMILES representation of the molecule is converted into a raw molecular image. Second, a convolutional encoder processes the data to obtain a fingerprint molecular image that is finally analyzed by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This approach enables precise predictions of the molecules target on the basis of the feature extraction, the sequence analysis and the relevant information filtered out throughout the process. Molecule Target prediction is a highly unbalanced detection problem and therefore, we propose that an adequate evaluation metric of performance is the area under the Normalized Average Precision (NAP) curve. PharmaNet largely surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method with 95.8% in the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and 58.9% in the NAP curve. We obtained a perfect performance for human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is a potential target for antimicrobial and anticancer treatments. We decided to test PharmaNet for activity prediction against FPPS by searching in the CHEMBL data set. We obtained [3] potential inhibitors that were further validated through both molecular docking and in silico toxicity prediction.

The relative predictive value of SOFA by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection status and among racial and ethnic subgroups within patients infected with COVID-19 is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy and calibration of SOFA in predicting hospital mortality by COVID-19 infection status and across racial and ethnic subgroups. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult admissions to the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics inpatient wards (July 1, 2020CApril 1, 2021). We primarily considered maximum SOFA within 48 hours of hospitalization. We assessed accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and created calibration belts. Considered subgroups were defined by COVID-19 infection status (by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction testing) and prevalent racial and ethnic minorities. Comparisons across subgroups were made with DeLong testing for discriminative accuracy and visualization of calibration belts. RESULTS: Our primary cohort consisted of 20,045 hospitalizations, of which 1,894 (9.5%) were COVID-19 positive. SOFA was similarly accurate for COVID-19Cpositive (AUROC, 0.835) and COVID-19Cnegative (AUROC, 0.810; P = 0.15) admissions but was slightly better calibrated in patients who were positive for COVID-19. For those with critical illness, maximum SOFA score accuracy at critical illness onset also did not differ by COVID-19 status (AUROC, COVID-19 positive vs. negative: intensive care unit admissions, 0.751 vs. 0.775; P = 0.46; mechanically ventilated, 0.713 vs. 0.792, P = 0.13), and calibration was again better for patients positive for COVID-19. Among patients with COVID-19, SOFA accuracy was similar between the non-Hispanic White population (AUROC, 0.894) and racial and ethnic minorities (Hispanic White population: AUROC, 0.824 [P vs. non-Hispanic White = 0.05]; non-Hispanic Black population: AUROC, 0.800 [P = 0.12]; Hispanic Black population: AUROC, 0.948 [P = 0.31]). This similar accuracy was also found for those without COVID-19 (non-Hispanic White population: AUROC, 0.829; Hispanic White population: AUROC, 0.811 [P = 0.37]; Hispanic Black population: AUROC, 0.828 [P = 0.97]; non-Hispanic Black population: AUROC, 0.867 [P = 0.46]). SOFA was well calibrated for all racial and ethnic groups with COVID-19 but estimated mortality more variably and performed less well across races and ethnicities without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: SOFA accuracy does not differ by COVID-19 status and is similar among racial and ethnic groups both with and without COVID-19.

Since its outbreak in December 2019, the pandemic has spread to more than 200 countries, infected more than 26 million, and claimed the lives of more than 800,000 people. As a disease, COVID-19 can lead to severe and occasionally fatal respiratory problems in humans. Infection with this virus is associated with fever, cough, dyspnea, and muscle aches, and it may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death. To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment against this virus. However, the main viral protease has been recently discovered and it is regarded as an appropriate target for antiviral agents in the search for treatment of COVID-19, due to its pivotal role in polyproteins processing during viral replication. AIM: Consequently, this study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs against SARA-CoV-2 through a molecular docking study. METHODS: AutoDock Vina in PyRx platform was used for docking analysis against the main viral protease (Mpro) (PDB ID 6LU7), and Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins (CASTp 3.0) was applied for detecting and characterizing cavities, pockets, and channels of this protein structure. RESULTS: Results revealed that among the conventional antiviral drugs, the protease inhibitors, lopinavir, amprenavir, indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir, and daclatasvir showed high binding affinity and interacted with amino acid residues of the binding site.

In addition, a constituent of surfactant, phosphatidylglycerol, could mitigate COVID-19-induced lung pathology by: (3) decreasing excessive innate immune system activation via its inhibition of toll-like receptor-2 and -4 activation by microbial components and cellular proteins released by damaged cells, thereby limiting inflammation and the resultant pulmonary edema, and (4) possibly blocking spread of the viral infection to non-infected cells in the lung.

The replicase protein and capsid protein consist of 303 amino acids and 270 amino acids respectively. Several immuno-informatics methods such as epitope screening, molecular docking, and molecular-dynamics simulations were used to craft peptide-based vaccine construct against canine circovirus. RESULTS: The vaccine construct was designed by joining the selected epitopes with adjuvants by suitable linker. The cloning and expression of the vaccine construct was also performed using in silico methods. Screening of epitopes was conducted by NetMHC server that uses ANN (Artificial neural networking) algorithm. These methods are fast and cost-effective for screening epitopes that can interact with dog leukocyte antigens (DLA) and initiate an immune response. Overall, 5 epitopes, YQHLPPFRF, YIRAKWINW, ALYRRLTLI, HLQGFVNLK, and GTMNFVARR, were selected and used to design a vaccine construct. The molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies show that these epitopes can bind with DLA molecules with stability. The codon adaptation and in silico cloning studies show that the vaccine can be expressed by Escherichia coli K12 strain.

In addition, virus strains were isolated in MDCK cells. Overall, 37 influenza virus strains were type A, and one type B. Of these, 35 (80.4%) were detected and typed by real-time RT-PCR, 34 (80.1%) by DFA, and 27 (71.0%) by virus isolation. Subtyping of 37 influenza virus A strains by RT-PCR and DFA gave the following results: 4/6 H1 strains were correctly subtyped by both methods, while of the 29 H3 strains subtyped by RT-PCR 7 were missed by DFA. Thus, the overall concordance of the two subtyping methods was 28/37 (75.7%). Viral RNA quantification by real-time PCR showed that when respiratory secretion collection was done within 5 days after the onset of symptoms, viral load was greater than 1 x 10(6) RNA copies/ml.

Early data suggest elevated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, but relationships to disease phenotype and downstream regulators of inflammation in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) are unknown. We aimed to determine the relationship between RAS gene expression relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung with disease characteristics in COPD, and the regulation of newly identified SARS-CoV-2 receptors and spike-cleaving proteases, important for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We quantified gene expression using RNA sequencing of epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies from 31 COPD and 37 control subjects. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression (log2-fold change (FC)) was increased in COPD compared to ex-smoking (HV-ES) controls in epithelial brushings (0.25, p = 0.042) and bronchial biopsies (0.23, p = 0.050), and correlated with worse lung function (r = - 0.28, p = 0.0090). ACE2 was further increased in frequent exacerbators compared to infrequent exacerbators (0.51, p = 0.00045) and associated with use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) (0.50, p = 0.0034), having cardiovascular disease (0.23, p = 0.048) or hypertension (0.34, p = 0.0089), and inhaled corticosteroid use in COPD subjects in bronchial biopsies (0.33, p = 0.049). Angiotensin II receptor type (AGTR)1 and 2 expression was decreased in COPD bronchial biopsies compared to HV-ES controls with log2FC of -0.26 (p = 0.033) and - 0.40, (p = 0.0010), respectively. However, the AGTR1:2 ratio was increased in COPD subjects compared with HV-ES controls, log2FC of 0.57 (p = 0.0051). Basigin, a newly identified potential SARS-CoV-2 receptor was also upregulated in both brushes, log2FC of 0.17 (p = 0.0040), and bronchial biopsies, (log2FC of 0.18 (p = 0.017), in COPD vs HV-ES. Transmembrane protease, serine (TMPRSS)2 was not differentially regulated between control and COPD. However, various other spike-cleaving proteases were, including TMPRSS4 and Cathepsin B, in both epithelial brushes (log2FC of 0.25 (p = 0.0012) and log2FC of 0.56 (p = 5.49E-06), respectively) and bronchial biopsies (log2FC of 0.49 (p = 0.00021) and log2FC of 0.246 (p = 0.028), respectively).

ACE (HA) (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, USA), LigaSure? V (LIG) (Covidien, USA), and EnSeal(?) (Ethicon). METHODS An acute study was done with 10 female Yorkshire pigs (weighing 30-35 kg). Samples 2 cm long of small (2-3 mm)-, medium (4-5 mm)-, and large (6-7 mm)-diameter vessels were created. One end of the sample was sent for histological evaluation, and the other was used for burst pressure testing in a blinded fashion. Versatility was defined as the performance of the surgical instrument based on the following five variables, using a score from 1 to 5 (1=worst, 5=best), adjusted by coefficient of variable importance with weighted distribution: hemostasis, 0.275; histologic sealing, 0.275; cutting, 0.2; dissection, 0.15; and tissue manipulation, 0.1. There were 80 trials per vessel group and 60 trials per instrument group, giving a total of 240 samples. RESULTS Versatility score was higher (P<.01) and dissection time was shorter (P<.01) using TB compared with the other three devices. Bursting pressure was similar among TB and the other three instruments. Thermal spread at surgery was similar between TB and HA (P=.4167), TB and EnSeal (P=.6817), and TB and LIG (P=.8254). Difference in thermal spread was noted between EnSeal and HA (P=.0087) and HA and LIG (P=.0167). CONCLUSION TB has a higher versatility compared with the other instruments tested with faster dissection speed, similar bursting pressure, and acceptable thermal spread. This new energy device is an appealing, safe alternative for cutting, coagulation, and tissue dissection during surgery and should decrease time and increase versatility during surgical procedures.","output":"Evaluation of the safety, efficacy, and versatility of a new surgical energy device (THUNDERBEAT) in comparison with Harmonic ACE, LigaSure V, and EnSeal devices in a porcine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Research is urgently needed to understand health care workers' (HCWs') experiences of moral-ethical dilemmas encountered throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and their associations with organizational perceptions and personal well-being.

We estimated levels and trends in under-5 mortality for 195 countries from 1990 to 2019, and conducted scenario-based projections of the U5MR and NMR from 2020 to 2030 to assess country progress in, and potential for, reaching SDG targets on child survival and the potential under-5 and neonatal deaths over the next decade. METHODS: Levels and trends in under-5 mortality are based on the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) database on under-5 mortality, which contains around 18 000 country-year datapoints for 195 countriesnearly 10 000 of those datapoints since 1990. The database includes nationally representative mortality data from vital registration systems, sample registration systems, population censuses, and household surveys. As with previous sets of national UN IGME estimates, a Bayesian B-spline bias-reduction model (B3) that considers the systematic biases associated with the different data source types was fitted to these data to generate estimates of under-5 (age 0C4 years) mortality with uncertainty intervals for 1990C2019 for all countries. Levels and trends in the neonatal mortality rate (0C27 days) are modelled separately as the log ratio of the neonatal mortality rate to the under-5 mortality rate using a Bayesian model. Estimated mortality rates are combined with livebirths data to calculate the number of under-5 and neonatal deaths. To assess the regional and global burden of under-5 deaths in the present decade and progress towards SDG targets, we constructed several scenario-based projections of under-5 mortality from 2020 to 2030 and estimated national, regional, and global under-5 mortality trends up to 2030 for each scenario. FINDINGS: The global U5MR decreased by 59% (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 56C61) from 930 (917C945) deaths per 1000 livebirths in 1990 to 377 (361C408) in 2019, while the annual number of global under-5 deaths declined from 125 (123C127) million in 1990 to 52 (50C56) million in 2019a 58% (55C60) reduction. The global NMR decreased by 52% (90% UI 48C55) from 366 (356C378) deaths per 1000 livebirths in 1990, to 175 (166C190) in 2019, and the annual number of global neonatal deaths declined from 50 (49C52) million in 1990, to 24 (23C27) million in 2019, a 51% (47C54) reduction. As of 2019, 122 of 195 countries have achieved the SDG U5MR target, and 20 countries are on track to achieve the target by 2030, while 53 will need to accelerate progress to meet the target by 2030. 116 countries have reached the SDG NMR target with 16 on track, leaving 63 at risk of missing the target. If current trends continue, 481 million under-5 deaths are projected to occur between 2020 and 2030, almost half of them projected to occur during the neonatal period. If all countries met the SDG target on under-5 mortality, 11 million under-5 deaths could be averted between 2020 and 2030. INTERPRETATION: As a result of effective global health initiatives, millions of child deaths have been prevented since 1990. However, the task of ending all preventable child deaths is not done and millions more deaths could be averted by meeting international targets. Geographical and economic variation demonstrate the possibility of even lower mortality rates for children under age 5 years and point to the regions and countries with highest mortality rates and in greatest need of resources and action.

These mutants exhibit wild-type activity at permissive temperatures and reduced activity at restrictive temperatures. Although random mutagenesis can be used to generate TS mutants, the procedure is laborious and unfeasible in multicellular organisms. Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TS phenotype are poorly understood. To elucidate TS mechanisms, we used a machine learning methodClogistic regressionCto investigate a large number of sequence and structure features. We developed and tested 133 features, describing properties of either the mutation site or the mutation site neighborhood. We defined three types of neighborhood using sequence distance, Euclidean distance, and topological distance. We discovered that neighborhood features outperformed mutation site features in predicting TS mutations. The most predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid residues, and are located at conserved protein domains. The environment of a buried residue often determines the overall structural stability of a protein, thus may lead to reversible activity change upon temperature switch. We developed TS prediction models based on logistic regression and the Lasso regularized procedure. Through a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the area under the curve of 0.91 for the model using both sequence and structure features. Testing on independent datasets suggested that the model predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision. In summary, our study elucidated the molecular basis of TS mutants and suggested the importance of neighborhood properties in determining TS mutations. We further developed models to predict TS mutations derived from single amino acid substitutions.

The heteromeric composition of native channels is often precisely controlled. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels from rod photoreceptors exhibit a 3:1 stoichiometry of CNGA1 and CNGB1 subunits that tunes the channels for their specialized role in phototransduction. Here we show, using electrophysiology, fluorescence, biochemistry, and X-ray crystallography, that the mechanism for this controlled assembly is the formation of a parallel 3-helix coiled-coil domain of the carboxy-terminal leucine zipper region of CNGA1 subunits, constraining the channel to contain three CNGA1 subunits, followed by preferential incorporation of a single CNGB1 subunit. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal leucine zipper domain relaxed the constraint and permitted multiple CNGB1 subunits in the channel. The X-ray crystal structures of the parallel 3-helix coiled-coil domains of CNGA1 and CNGA3 subunits were similar, suggesting that a similar mechanism controls the stoichiometry of cone CNG channels.

However, like other machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular, perform worse when the data sets present label noise. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that help the training of deep networks and their generalization to noise-free test sets. In this paper, we propose a robust training strategy against label noise, called RAFNI, that can be used with any CNN. This algorithm filters and relabels instances of the training set based on the predictions and their probabilities made by the backbone neural network during the training process. That way, this algorithm improves the generalization ability of the CNN on its own. RAFNI consists of three mechanisms: two mechanisms that filter instances and one mechanism that relabels instances. In addition, it does not suppose that the noise rate is known nor does it need to be estimated. We evaluated our algorithm using different data sets of several sizes and characteristics. We also compared it with state-of-the-art models using the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks under different types and rates of label noise and found that RAFNI achieves better results in most cases.","output":"A robust approach for deep neural networks in presence of label noise: relabelling and filtering instances during training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed urgency to answer numerous questions about the control of viral infections and the dual immune response of protection of and damage to the host, with the purpose of finding specific and efficient treatments and strategies for prevention of infection The association between severe cases of the disease and overactivation of the immune response has raised the hypotheses that the inflammatory response participates in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that neutrophils are important effector cells of such response In this sense, neutrophils are potential targets for pharmacological interventions to treat this infection The present paper briefly de-scribes the neutrophil biology and discusses the possible roles that neutrophils play in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, based on literature data ? 2020 by Begell House, Inc","output":"Neutrophils and covid-19: What is going on?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wogonin is one of the most active flavonoids from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (baikal skullcap), widely used in traditional Chinese medicine.

CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old male patient presented with clinical features consistent with Cushings syndrome (CS) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent hypercortisolemia. Despite a suspicious lesion on pituitary MRI, the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling results were not compatible with Cushings disease. Bilateral non-homogeneous opacities were observed in the thorax CT of the patient, who also had a history of COVID-19 infection, but no tumoral lesion was detected. When (68)Ga-SSTR PET/CT and (18)FDG-PET/CT were performed, multiple metastatic foci were detected in mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and the axial skeleton. Paratracheal-subcarinal lymph nodes were excised mediastinoscopically, and the diagnosis of NEN was made. Histopathological findings indicated that the possible origin was an atypical pulmonary carcinoid with a low Ki-67 labeling index. After controlling hypercortisolemia, a regimen of somatostatin analogs and capecitabine plus temozolomide was decided upon as treatment by a multidisciplinary council.

Objective: To examine the association of identified SARS-CoV-2 variants, virus clades, and clade groups with disease severity and patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, viral genome analysis of clinical specimens obtained from patients at the Cleveland Clinic infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial wave of infection (March 11 to April 22, 2020) was performed. Identified variants were matched with clinical outcomes. Data analysis was performed from April to July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and laboratory outcomes were matched with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Results: Specimens sent for viral genome sequencing originated from 302 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median [interquartile range] age, 52.6 [22.8 to 82.5] years), of whom 126 (41.7%) were male, 195 (64.6%) were White, 91 (30.1%) required hospitalization, 35 (11.6%) needed ICU admission, and 17 (5.6%) died. From these specimens, 2531 variants (484 of which were unique) were identified. Six different SARS-CoV-2 clades initially circulated followed by a rapid reduction in clade diversity. Several variants were associated with lower hospitalization rate, and those containing 23403A>G (D614G Spike) were associated with increased survival when the patient was hospitalized (64 of 74 patients [86.5%] vs 10 of 17 patients [58.8%]; &#967;21 = 6.907; P = .009). Hospitalization and ICU admission were similar regardless of clade. Infection with Clade V variants demonstrated higher creatinine levels (median [interquartile range], 2.6 [-0.4 to 5.5] mg/dL vs 1.0 [0.2 to 2.2] mg/dL; mean creatinine difference, 2.9 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.8 to 5.0 mg/dL]; Kruskal-Wallis P = .005) and higher overall mortality rates (3 of 14 patients [21.4%] vs 17 of 302 patients [5.6%]; &#967;21 = 5.640; P = .02) compared with other variants. Infection by strains lacking the 23403A>G variant showed higher mortality in multivariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 22.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6; P = .01). Increased variants of open reading frame (ORF) 3a were associated with decreased hospitalization frequency (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.96; P = .04), whereas increased variants of Spike (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.3; P = .01) and ORF8 (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.6; P = .03) were associated with increased survival. Conclusions and Relevance: Within weeks of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, a profound shift toward 23403A>G (D614G) specific genotypes occurred. Replaced clades were associated with worse clinical outcomes, including mortality. These findings help explain persistent hospitalization yet decreasing mortality as the pandemic progresses.

STUDY DESIGN We quantified the concentrations of free (bioavailable; pg/ml) and total (protein bound and free; ng/dl) testosterone in plasma (frozen within 24 h) and supernatants from 42-day stored leukocyte-reduced RBC units from 17 TRT male donors and 17 matched controls (no TRT). Total testosterone concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Free testosterone concentrations were quantified in the same samples using equilibrium dialysis/LC-MS/MS. RESULTS Plasmafree and total testosterone concentrations in TRT donors were 2.9 and 1.8 times higher than that of controls. Total testosterone concentrations in RBC supernatants were about 30% of that of plasma. In contrast, free testosterone concentrations in RBC supernatants were 80%-100% of that of plasma and were significantly (p = .005) higher in TRT compared with controls (252.3  245.3 vs. 103.4  88.2 pg/ml).

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes.

Understanding and monitoring the major influences on COVID-19 prevalence is essential to inform policy making and device appropriate packages of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This study evaluates community level influences on COVID-19 incidence in England and their variations over time with specific focus on understanding the impact of working in so called high-risk industries such as care homes and warehouses. Analysis at community level allows accounting for interrelations between socioeconomic and demographic profile, land use, and mobility patterns including residents' self-selection and spatial sorting (where residents choose their residential locations based on their travel attitudes and preferences or social structure and inequality); this also helps understand the impact of policy interventions on distinct communities and areas given potential variations in their mobility, vaccination rates, behavioural responses, and health inequalities. Moreover, community level analysis can feed into more detailed epidemiological and individual models through tailoring and directing policy questions for further investigation. We have assembled a large set of static (socioeconomic and demographic profile and land use characteristics) and dynamic (mobility indicators, COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 vaccination uptake in real time) data for small area statistical geographies (Lower Layer Super Output Areas, LSOA) in England making the dataset, arguably, the most comprehensive set assembled in the UK for community level analysis of COVID-19 infection. The data are integrated from a wider range of sources including telecommunications companies, test and trace data, national travel survey, Census and Mid-Year estimates. To tackle methodological challenges specifically accounting for highly interrelated influences, we have augmented different statistical and machine learning techniques. We have adopted a two-stage modelling framework: a) Latent Cluster Analysis (LCA) to classify the country into distinct land use and travel patterns, and b) multivariate linear regression to evaluate influences at each distinct travel cluster. We have also segmented our data into different time periods based on changes in policies and evolvement in the course of pandemic (such as the emergence of a new variant of the virus). By segmenting and comparing influences across spaces and time, we examine more homogeneous behaviour and uniform distribution of infection risks which in turn increase the potential to make causal inferences and help understand variations across communities and over time. Our findings suggest that there exist significant spatial variations in risk influences with some being more consistent and persistent over time. Specifically, the analysis of industrial sectors shows that communities of workers in care homes and warehouses and to a lesser extent textile and ready meal industries tend to carry a higher risk of infection across all spatial clusters and over the whole period we modelled in this study. This demonstrates the key role that workplace risk has to play in COVID-19 risk of outbreak after accounting for the characteristics of workers' residential area (including socioeconomic and demographic profile and land use features), vaccination rate, and mobility patterns.","output":"Understanding community level influences on COVID-19 prevalence in England: New insights from comparison over time and space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many risk factors related to alteration of circadian rhythms impact the health of night-shift hospital workers (NSHW), resulting in mental and somatic disorders.

Five sampling points from three rivers (AR-1 and AR-2 in Arenales River, MR-1 and MR-2 in Mojotoro River, and CR in La Caldera River) from the Province of Salta (Argentina), two of them receiving the discharges of the wastewater plants (WWTP) of the city of Salta, were monitored from July to December 2020 during the first wave of COVID-19. Fifteen water samples from each point (75 samples in total) were collected and characterized physico-chemically and microbiologically and SARS-CoV-2 was quantitatively detected by RT-qPCR. In addition, two targets linked to human contributions, human polyomavirus (HPyV) and RNase P, were quantified and used to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 concentration, which was ultimately compared to the active reported COVID-19 cases. Statistical analyses allowed us to verify the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), as well as to find similarities and differences between sampling points. La Caldera River showed the best water quality, and FIB were within acceptable limits for recreational activities. Although Mojotoro River receives the discharge of the northern WWTP of the city, it did not affect the water quality. Instead, the Arenales River presented the poorest water quality and the river at AR-2 was negatively affected by the discharges of the southern WWTP, which contributed to the significant increase of fecal contamination. SARS-CoV-2 was only found in about half of the samples and in low concentrations in La Caldera and Mojotoro Rivers, while it was high and persistent in the Arenales River. None of the two human tracers was detected in CR, only HPyV was found in MR-1, MR-2 and AR-1, and both were quantified in AR-2. The experimental and the normalized (using the two tracers) viral concentrations strongly correlated with the curve of active reported COVID-19 cases; thus, the Arenales River at AR-2 reflected the epidemiological situation of the city. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that showed the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 concentration in an urban river highly impacted by wastewater and proved that can be used for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to support health authorities.","output":"Tracking SARS-CoV-2 in rivers as a tool for epidemiological surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been reported that lactoferrin (LF) participates in the host immune response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) invasion by enhancing NK cell activity and stimulating neutrophil aggregation and adhesion. We further investigated the role of LF in the entry of SARS pseudovirus into HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells. Our results reveal that LF inhibits SARS pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis suggested that LF was able to block the binding of spike protein to host cells at 4C, indicating that LF exerted its inhibitory function at the viral attachment stage. However, LF did not disrupt the interaction of spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV. Previous studies have shown that LF colocalizes with the widely distributed cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Our experiments have also confirmed this conclusion. Treatment of the cells with heparinase or exogenous heparin prevented binding of spike protein to host cells and inhibited SARS pseudovirus infection, demonstrating that HSPGs provide the binding sites for SARS-CoV invasion at the early attachment phase. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to ACE2, HSPGs are essential cell-surface molecules involved in SARS-CoV cell entry. LF may play a protective role in host defense against SARS-CoV infection through binding to HSPGs and blocking the preliminary interaction between SARS-CoV and host cells. Our findings may provide further understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and aid in treatment of this deadly disease.","output":"Inhibition of SARS Pseudovirus Cell Entry by Lactoferrin Binding to Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sickness behavior is broadly represented in vertebrates, usually in association with the fever response in response to acute infections. The reactions to sickness behavior in a group member or potential group member in humans is quite variable, depending upon circumstances. In animals, the reactions to sickness behavior in a group member or potential group member evoke a specific response that reflects the species-specific lifestyle. Groups of animals can employ varied strategies to reduce or address exposure to sickness. Most of these have scarcely been studied in nature from a disease perspective: (1) adjusting exposure to sick conspecifics or contaminated areas; (2) caring for a sick group member; (3) peripheralization and agonistic behaviors to strange non-group conspecifics; and (4) using special strategies at parturition when newborn are healthy but vulnerable. Unexplored in this regard is infanticide, where newborn that are born with very little immunity until they receive antibody-rich colostrum, could be a target of maternal infanticide if they manifest signs of sickness and could be infectious to littermates. The strategies used by different species are highly specific and dependent upon the particular circumstances.

Secondly, we identified a strong moderating effect of national culture on these predictors during the perception and evaluation of global consumers reviews. We also performed a quantile regression across the entire distribution of the count of helpful votes. Findings from our study will guide reviewers who publish helpful and comprehensive reviews.

METHODS: Among people who participated in a community cohort study between 2013 and 2018 with previous depression measurement, a total of 1928 people without quarantine experience (680 men and 1249 women) were included after responding to an online survey in March 2020. In the 2020 survey, people were queried about daily needs supply, social support, risk perception, change during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as mental health indices measuring loneliness, anxiety symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. Separate analyses by gender were conducted to assess the association between COVID-19-related experiences and each mental health index, using multivariable logistic regressions with additional adjustment and stratification with pre-existing depression status. RESULTS: We could not observe significant gender differences for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and loneliness at 55 days after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Most external support, including daily needs supply and social support, protected men and women from experiencing severe anxiety (for life supply, OR = 0.92 (95%CI 0.88-0.97) (men) and OR = 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) (women); for social support, OR = 0.92(both for men and women, p < 0.01)). The results were similar for depression and PTSD. External support showed a larger reduction in the likelihoods for anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with pre-existing depression compared to previously healthy people, and it was more prominent in men. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 significantly affected the mental health of both men and women in the early period of the pandemic.

Transitioning health programs from face-to-face to remote delivery using ICT platforms has introduced new challenges. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to scope for ICT-delivered health programs implemented within the community health setting in high-income countries and rapidly disseminate findings to health professionals. METHODS: The Joanna Briggs Institutes scoping review methodology guided the review of the literature. RESULTS: The search retrieved 7110 unique citations. Each title and abstract was screened by at least two reviewers, resulting in 399 citations for full-text review. Of these 399 citations, 72 (18%) were included. An additional 27 citations were identified through reviewing the reference lists of the included studies, resulting in 99 citations. Citations examined 83 ICT-delivered programs from 19 high-income countries. Variations in program design, ICT platforms, research design, and outcomes were evident. CONCLUSIONS: Included programs and research were heterogeneous, addressing prevalent chronic diseases. Evidence was retrieved for the effectiveness of nurse and allied health ICT-delivered programs. Findings indicated that outcomes for participants receiving ICT-delivered programs, when compared with participants receiving in-person programs, were either equivalent or better. Gaps included a paucity of co-designed programs, qualitative research around group programs, programs for patients and carers, and evaluation of cost-effectiveness.

They contribute to substantial economic burdens on society and individuals. Currently, only a few treatments are available to slow the development and progression of these diseases. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need to develop effective therapies to improve quality of life and limit healthcare costs. An increasing body of clinical and experimental evidence suggests that altered zinc and its regulatory protein levels in the systemic circulation and in the lungs are associated with these diseases development and progression. Zinc plays a crucial role in human enzyme activity, making it an essential trace element. As a cofactor in metalloenzymes and metalloproteins, zinc involves a wide range of biological processes, such as gene transcription, translation, phagocytosis, and immunoglobulin and cytokine production in both health and disease. Zinc has gained considerable interest in these lung diseases because of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune, and metabolic modulatory properties.

Particularly, the travel industry has become unquestionably vulnerable amid the COVID-19 outbreak;this pandemic has interrupted the industry's operations with devastating economic consequences. This paper aims to highlight the importance of deconstructing barriers between medical science and public awareness related to COVID-19, taking tourism as a case in point. It also discusses the role of interdisciplinary research in facilitating the tourism and hospitality industry's recovery and alleviating tourists' uncertainties in the wake of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This paper offers a synthesis of news coverage from several media outlets, framed within the literature on knowledge transformation across disciplines. This framing focuses on the medical sciences (e.g. public health) and social sciences (e.g. tourism management) to identify gaps between medical scientific knowledge and public awareness in the context of COVID-19. The authors' experience in public health and tourism management further demonstrates a missing link between academic research and the information made available in public health and everyday settings. A potential research agenda is proposed accordingly. Findings: This paper summarizes how salient issues related to knowledge transfer can become intensified during a global pandemic, such as medical research not being communicated in plain language, which leads some citizens to feel apathetic about findings. Reporting on the prevalence and anticipated consequences of disease outbreaks can hence be difficult, especially early in the development of diseases such as COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: By assuming a cross-disciplinary perspective on medical/health and social science research, this paper encourages academic and practical collaboration to bring medical research to the masses. This paper also outlines several research directions to promote public health, safety and sustainability through tourism. Practical implications: This paper highlights that it is essential for medical knowledge to be disseminated in a manner that promotes public understanding. The tourism and hospitality industry can benefit from an essential understanding of medical findings, particularly during this pandemic. Without a firm grasp on COVID-19's origins and treatment, the tourism and hospitality industry will likely struggle to recover from this catastrophe. Social implications: Taking COVID-19 as a case in point, this study advocates leveraging the strengths of disparate domains to bring medical findings to a wider audience and showcase cutting-edge developments for the greater good. This study also emphasizes the importance of engaging the general public in reputable scientific research findings to increase public awareness in a professional and accurate manner.

The interaction of these factors is an important consideration in forecasting how livestock diseases may be affected. Risk assessments should focus on looking for combinations of factors that may be directly affected by climate change, or that may be indirectly affected through changes in human activity, such as land use (e.g. deforestation), transport and movement of animals, intensity of livestock farming and habitat change. A risk assessment framework is proposed, based on modules that accommodate these factors.

The influence of this approach on hip strength and lower limb reactive strength and how these measures compare with uninjured athletes (CON) remain unknown. Additionally, the efficacy of this program after return to play (RTP) has not been examined. PURPOSE: First, to examine differences in isometric hip strength, reactive strength, and the Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) between the AGP and CON cohorts and after rehabilitation; second, to examine the relationship between the change in HAGOS and the change in strength variables after rehabilitation; last, to track HAGOS for 6 months after RTP. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 42 athletes diagnosed with AGP and 36 matched controls completed baseline testing: isometric hip strength, lower limb reactive strength, and HAGOS. After rehabilitation, athletes with AGP were retested, and HAGOS was collected at 3 and 6 months after RTP. RESULTS: In total, 36 athletes with AGP completed the program with an RTP time of 9.8  3.0 weeks (mean  SD). At baseline, these athletes had significantly lower isometric hip strength (abduction, adduction, flexion, extension, external rotation: d = C0.67 to ?1.20), single-leg reactive strength (d = ?0.73), and HAGOS (r = ?0.74 to ?0.89) as compared with the CON cohort. Hip strength (d = ?0.83 to ?1.15) and reactive strength (d = ?0.30) improved with rehabilitation and were no longer significantly different between groups at RTP. HAGOS improvements were maintained or improved in athletes with AGP up to 6 months after RTP, although some subscales remained significantly lower than the CON group (r = ?0.35 to ?0.51). Two linear regression features (hip abduction and external rotation) explained 11% of the variance in the HAGOS Sports and Recreation subscale. CONCLUSION: Athletes with AGP demonstrated isometric hip strength and reactive strength deficits that resolved after an intersegmental control rehabilitation program; however, improved hip strength explained only 11% of improvement in the Sports and Recreation subscale.

To accelerate it, autologous mesenchymal stem cells have been directly injected to the distraction site in a few recent studies. Compared to direct injection, a scaffold-based method can provide earlier cell delivery with potentially better controlled cell distribution and retention. This pilot project investigated a scaffold-based cell-delivery approach in a porcine mandibular DO model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven adolescent domestic pigs were used for two major sets of studies. The in-vitro set established methodologies to: aspirate bone marrow from the tibia; isolate, characterize and expand bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs); enhance BM-MSC osteogenic differentiation using FGF-2; and confirm cell integration with a gelatin-based Gelfoam scaffold. The in-vivo set transplanted autologous stem cells into the mandibular distraction sites using Gelfoam scaffolds; completed a standard DO-course and assessed bone regeneration by macroscopic, radiographic and histological methods. Repeated-measure ANOVAs and t-tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS From aspirated bone marrow, multi-potent, heterogeneous BM-MSCs purified from hematopoietic stem cell contamination were obtained. FGF-2 significantly enhanced pig BM-MSC osteogenic differentiation and proliferation, with 5 ng/ml determined as the optimal dosage. Pig BM-MSCs integrated readily with Gelfoam and maintained viability and proliferative ability. After integration with Gelfoam scaffolds, 2.4-5.810(7) autologous BM-MSCs (undifferentiated or differentiated) were transplanted to each experimental DO site. Among 8 evaluable DO sites included in the final analyses, the experimental DO sites demonstrated less interfragmentary mobility, more advanced gap obliteration, higher mineral content and faster mineral apposition than the control sites, and all transplanted scaffolds were completely degraded. CONCLUSION It is technically feasible and biologically sound to deliver autologous BM-MSCs to the distraction site immediately after osteotomy using a Gelfoam scaffold to enhance mandibular DO.","output":"Scaffold-based delivery of autologous mesenchymal stem cells for mandibular distraction osteogenesis: preliminary studies in a porcine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is now over 30 years since the first airport privatisation occurred with BAA in the UK in 1987 Therefore, the aim of this paper is to assess the impacts of this development and evaluate its effectiveness, using examples from all over the world It begins by considering some key issues such as the extent of government involvement;the selection of operator/investor;the choice of network/group versus individual operations;and the relevance of economic regulation This then leads on to an investigation of measures of success, particularly in relation to efficiency and service quality Reflecting on the privatisation journey, the paper defines key changes that have occurred concerning how privatisation is considered now compared to its early days in terms of motivation, geographical reach and type of model, investor and sale It also highlights the importance of the regulatory and competitive environment and briefly considers the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020","output":"Airport privatisation: A successful journey?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been continuously affecting human lives and communities around the world in many ways, from cities under lockdown to new social experiences.

The most widely used tests are rapid lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) assays have also been developed. The overall accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests, however, is not well defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is the third in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by IDSA. OBJECTIVE IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and non-medical settings. METHODS A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS The panel agreed on five diagnostic recommendations. These recommendations address antigen testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as well as assess single versus repeat testing strategies. CONCLUSIONS Data on the clinical performance of U.S. Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with Emergency Use Authorization is mostly limited to single, one-time testing versus standard nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) as the reference standard. Rapid Ag tests have high specificity and low to modest sensitivity compared to reference NAAT methods. Antigen test sensitivity is heavily dependent on viral load, with differences observed between symptomatic compared to asymptomatic individuals and the time of testing post onset of symptoms. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the diagnostic methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, when molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, Ag testing can help identify some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall quality of available evidence supporting use of Ag testing was graded as very low to moderate.","output":"The Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Diagnosis of COVID-19: Antigen Testing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggle to access high-quality health care due to the shortage of trained providers.

Evidence has shown that perillaldehyde (PAH) can ameliorate rat's cerebra ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the effect of PAH on SCII remains unknown. METHODS: The current study established SCII rat models and oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced BV2 microglia models to explore whether PAH could alleviate SCII symptoms and to investigate underlying mechanism. RESULTS: SCII rats underwent severe neurologic motor dysfunction and histopathologic injury compared with the normal rats, which are exhibited by loss of motor neurons and decrease of nissl bodies. Treatment with PAH significantly ameliorated motor dysfunction and neuron damage. PAH downregulated the expression of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3, cleaved/pro caspase-1, interleukin-1? and interleukin-18 in spinal cord tissues of SCII rats. Besides, the contents of oxidative stress-related factors superoxide dismutase, manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were significantly increased and malondialdehyde content was decreased after PAH treatment. PAH treatment upregulated the expression of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 in spinal cord tissues of SCII rats. Our in vitro study confirmed that PAH inhibited microglial activation by activating the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway, exhibited by alleviated inflammation and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates that PAH has the potential value for treating SCII, which provides an experimental basis for clinical trials in the future.","output":"Perillaldehyde Alleviates Spinal Cord Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Via Activating the Nrf2 Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facing the COVID-19 global healthcare crisis, scientists worldwide are collaborating to develop prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against the disease. Antibody therapeutics hold enormous promise for the treatment of COVID-19. In March 2020, the Chinese Antibody Society, in collaboration with The Antibody Society, initiated the \\"COVID-19 Antibody Therapeutics Tracker\\" (\\"Tracker\\") (https://chineseantibody.org/covid-19-track/) program to track the antibody-based COVID-19 interventions in preclinical and clinical development globally. The data are collected from the public domain and verified by volunteers on an ongoing basis. Here, we present exploratory data analyses and visualization to demonstrate the latest trends of COVID-19 antibody development, based on data for over 150 research and development programs and molecules included in the \\"Tracker\\" as of 8 August 2020. We categorized the data mainly by their targets, formats, development status, developers and country of origin. Although details are limited in some cases, all of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody candidates appear to target the viral spike protein (S protein), and most are full-length monoclonal antibodies. Most of the current COVID-19 antibody therapeutic candidates in clinical trials are repurposed drugs aimed at targets other than virus-specific proteins, while most of these virus-specific therapeutic antibodies are in discovery or preclinical studies. As of 8 August 2020, eight antibody candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein have entered clinical studies, including LY-CoV555, REGN-COV2, JS016, TY027, CT-P59, BRII-196, BRII-198 and SCTA01.

Owning to the irreplaceable superiorities, the research enthusiasm for the LC biosensors is rapidly rising. As a result, it is necessary to overview the development of the LC biosensors to guide future work. This article reviews the basic theory and advanced applications of LC biosensors. We first discuss different mesophases and geometries employed to fabricate LC biosensors, after which we introduce various detecting mechanisms involved in biomolecular detection. We then focus on diverse detection targets such as proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, glucose, cholesterol, bile acids, and lipopolysaccharides. For each of these targets, the development history and state-of-the-art work are exhibited in detail.

The discussion platform Reddit has become a popular social media data source in this nascent area of study, in part because of the unique ways in which the platform is facilitative of research. To date, no work has been done to synthesize existing studies on depression and anxiety using Reddit. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to understand the scope and nature of research using Reddit as a primary data source for studying depression and anxiety. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and OMalley framework. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and ACM academic databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were developed using the participants, concept, and context framework outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology Group. Eligible studies featured an analytic focus on depression or anxiety and used naturalistic written expressions from Reddit users as a primary data source. RESULTS: A total of 54 studies were included in the review. Tables and corresponding analyses delineate the key methodological features, including a comparatively larger focus on depression versus anxiety, an even split of original and premade data sets, a widespread analytic focus on classifying the mental health states of Reddit users, and practical implications that often recommend new methods of professionally delivered monitoring and outreach for Reddit users. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of depression and anxiety using Reddit data are currently driven by a prevailing methodology that favors a technical, solution-based orientation. Researchers interested in advancing this research area will benefit from further consideration of conceptual issues surrounding the interpretation of Reddit data with the medical model of mental health. Further efforts are also needed to locate accountability and autonomy within practice implications, suggesting new forms of engagement with Reddit users.","output":"Studies of Depression and Anxiety Using Reddit as a Data Source: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing, tracking and tracing abilities have been identified as pivotal in helping countries to safely reopen activities after the first wave of the COVID-19 virus.

The statistical findings show that climate change, particularly cooling, affected epidemics significantly. Economic well-being was the important factor that influenced the dynamics of epidemics alongside climate change. Furthermore, if considering climatic impacts, population was also significant, but its effects had limited importance on epidemics compared with economic well-being. This study not only supplements current understanding of epidemic mechanisms within the context of human ecology, but also examines the economyCepidemic link from a pre-industrial perspective to consider the role of economy in epidemic outbreaks in the modern time.

This was further examined to determine whether conforming to recommended guidelines on PA and sedentary behaviour was improved. Based on an online survey (n = 818) incorporating the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF), self-reported body mass change showed that in 32.2% of participants body mass increased, with 39.1% reporting an increase in food intake. Never exercising at the gym or undertaking an exercise class (online or live), increased by 50.8% during lockdown, with 53.5% changing from exercising frequently to never exercising, suggesting a lack of engagement with online and home workouts. However, outdoor running and cycling >2 times/week increased by 38% during lockdown. Walking at least 30 min continuously on >2 occasions/week increased by 70% during lockdown with minimum 10-min walks on 7 days per week increasing by 23%. The lockdown had a negative impact on sitting time (>8 h a day), which increased by 43.6% on weekdays and 121% at weekends. Furthermore, sitting <4 h/day decreased during lockdown (46.5% and 25.6% for weekdays and weekends, respectively). Those citing tiredness or lack of time as a barrier to exercise reduced by 16% and 60%, respectively, from pre-lockdown to during lockdown.

It contains a large part of the articles cited in peer-reviewed publications . The journals included in Scopus are periodically re-evaluated to ensure they meet indexing criteria and some journals might be discontinued for 'publication concerns'. Previously published articles may remain indexed and can be cited. Their metrics have yet to be studied. This study aimed to evaluate the main features and metrics of journals discontinued from Scopus for publication concerns, before and after their discontinuation, and to determine the extent of predatory journals among the discontinued journals. Methods: We surveyed the list of discontinued journals from Scopus (July 2019). Data regarding metrics, citations and indexing were extracted from Scopus or other scientific databases, for the journals discontinued for publication concerns. Results: A total of 317 journals were evaluated. Ninety-three percent of the journals (294/317) declared they published using an Open Access model. The subject areas with the greatest number of discontinued journals were Medicine (52/317; 16%), Agriculture and Biological Science (34/317; 11%), and Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (31/317; 10%). The mean number of citations per year after discontinuation was significantly higher than before (median of difference 16.89 citations, p<0.0001), and so was the number of citations per document (median of difference 0.42 citations, p<0.0001). Twenty-two percent (72/317) were included in the Cabells blacklist. The DOAJ currently included only 9 journals while 61 were previously included and discontinued, most for 'suspected editorial misconduct by the publisher'. Conclusions: Journals discontinued for 'publication concerns' continue to be cited despite discontinuation and predatory behaviour seemed common. These citations may influence scholars metrics prompting artificial career advancements, bonus systems and promotion. Countermeasures should be taken urgently to ensure the reliability of Scopus metrics for the purpose of scientific assessment of scholarly publishing at both journal- and author-level.","output":"Citations and metrics of journals discontinued from Scopus for publication concerns: the GhoS(t)copus Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuroinflammation is closely related to the development of depression, since the latter is caused, among other factors, by inflammatory processes, mainly related to the activation of microglia and expression of specific genes, which occurs during the neuroinflammatory process. Thus, COVID-19 is an important risk factor for the development of depression, since in addition to generating the feeling of stress, which also increases the activity of the immune system, it is also the cause of pathological processes and physiological ones that lead to the development of neuroinflammation, microglial activation, gene expression dysfunction and decreased concentration of available serotonin. That said, drugs are being used to combat COVID-19 to reduce the oxidative stress presented in the disease. Thus, tramadol and fluoxetine are highlighted as drugs used, however, although they present some positive results, such as the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, they are also associated with negative effects such as dependence, pulmonary, cardiac and brain impairment. From this, the purinergic system is highlighted in the literature as a possible therapeutic target. This is because its mechanisms are related to the regulation of microglia, astrocytes and the physiology of important neurotransmitters and hormones. Added to this, there is a modulation of inflammatory activity, especially with regard to the P2X7 receptors of this system. The latter is an important target for the treatment of depression and COVID-19, since positive results were obtained through the genetic exclusion of this receptor and the use of selective antagonists.

In an attempt to control its spread, countries have imposed local and national lockdowns, affecting many healthcare services, especially sexual and reproductive health services which are actually essential and lifesaving. In near future this will result in a large number of grave consequences including increased unmet need for modern contraceptives, unintended pregnancies, increased unsafe abortions, maternal and neonatal deaths and other harmful practices like female genital mutilation and child marriages in developing countries. The present short review focusses on such issues which will be dramatically increased depending on the duration of lockdowns and the time for which the sexual and reproductive health services will remain halted. It also reflects the need for considering reproductive health services as essential, allowing the people to avail these services without any fear and hence, saving many more lives which will be lost not due to coronavirus infection.

This study used the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model to examine (a) whether workplace accommodations enable workers, particularly those with different impairments, to remain economically active; and (b) the predictors of the onset of work accommodations. Data from two waves of a large-scale longitudinal survey of disability in Great Britain, the Life Opportunities Survey (2009-2012) were analysed. 2307 workers with an impairment and 4308 workers without an impairment were followed up for a year. Work accommodations appear to enable workers with impairments to remain economically active, especially those with mental impairments. There was no difference in the employment rates of workers with and without mental impairments who had two or more work accommodations, in contrast to the 10% employment gap between workers with and without mental impairments who did not have any work accommodations. While there was no gender difference in the disability employment gap, barriers to employment related to caregiving were much greater for women compared to men. Moreover, only workers with incident pain impairments were associated with an increase in their work accommodations, not workers with incident mental impairments. Despite the evidence that workers with mental impairments could benefit considerably from workplace accommodations, they are less likely to have their workplace adjusted. The ICF model is particularly useful in analysing the role of work accommodations because it considers a much wider range of factors that are relevant not just to workers with different types of impairments, but are also relevant to the wider group of workers who use workplace accommodations.","output":"The role of workplace accommodations in explaining the disability employment gap in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that is the causal agent of COVID-19, has caused more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide and triggered a global pandemic.

In order to evaluate the effects of CAP in a relevant context of the human disease, we developed a 3D tissue-engineered model of osteosarcoma using a bone-like scaffold made of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. Human osteosarcoma cells cultured within the scaffold showed a high capacity to infiltrate and proliferate and to exhibit osteomimicry in vitro. As expected, we observed significantly different functional behaviors between monolayer and 3D cultures when treated with Cold Plasma-Activated Ringer's Solution (PAR). Our data reveal that the 3D environment not only protects cells from PAR-induced lethality by scavenging and diminishing the amount of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated by CAP, but also favours the stemness phenotype of osteosarcoma cells. This is the first study that demonstrates the negative effect of PAR on cancer stem-like cell subpopulations in a 3D biomimetic model of cancer.

However, these measures only work if they are generally accepted by the public. We conducted a two-wave longitudinal survey in Switzerland (n = 1,223) to study the factors that would influence perceived risks and the acceptance of the measures. Our findings showed that people with individualistic worldviews, high general interpersonal trust, low social trust, a low level of perceived risks, and the conviction that risks other than health risks were neglected had less acceptance of the implemented measures compared with people who held the opposite views on the mentioned variables. The number of infected people declined between survey waves 1 and 2. This desired effect not only reduced people's perceived risks but also decreased their social trust and increased the conviction that other risks were neglected. Finally, the acceptance of the measures declined. Our data also support the idea that reduced risk perceptions and a decline in social trust are important drivers for the reduction in the acceptance of the measures in survey wave 2. Our results suggest that as soon as the measures attain success or the public is tired of the implemented restrictions, public acceptance declines, and it seems difficult to prolong the measures as may be desirable from an epidemiological standpoint.

Blood samples were taken from patients ca. 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection with further assessment of symptoms at 6 months. Some 57% of the patients had one or more persistent symptoms including respiratory-related symptoms like cough, dyspnea, and rhinorrhea or other nonrespiratory symptoms including chronic fatigue, anosmia, myalgia, or joint pain. Plasma samples were quantitatively analyzed for lipoproteins, glycoproteins, amino acids, biogenic amines, and tryptophan pathway intermediates using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Metabolic data for the follow-up patients (n = 27) were compared with controls (n = 41) and hospitalized severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 18, with multiple time-points). Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed variable patterns of functional recovery with many patients exhibiting residual COVID-19 biomarker signatures. Several parameters were persistently perturbed, e.g., elevated taurine (p = 3.6  10-3 versus controls) and reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio (p = 6.95  10-8 versus controls), indicative of possible liver and muscle damage and a high energy demand linked to more generalized tissue repair or immune function. Some parameters showed near-complete normalization, e.g., the plasma apolipoprotein B100/A1 ratio was similar to that of healthy controls but significantly lower (p = 4.2  10-3) than post-acute COVID-19 patients, reflecting partial reversion of the metabolic phenotype (phenoreversion) toward the healthy metabolic state. Plasma neopterin was normalized in all follow-up patients, indicative of a reduction in the adaptive immune activity that has been previously detected in active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as GlycA and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio remained elevated in some, but not all, patients. Correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal-partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) showed that the follow-up patients were, as a group, metabolically distinct from controls and partially comapped with the acute-phase patients. Significant systematic metabolic differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic follow-up patients were also observed for multiple metabolites. The overall metabolic variance of the symptomatic patients was significantly greater than that of nonsymptomatic patients for multiple parameters (&#967;2 p = 0.014). Thus, asymptomatic follow-up patients including those with post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome displayed a spectrum of multiple persistent biochemical pathophysiology, suggesting that the metabolic phenotyping approach may be deployed for multisystem functional assessment of individual post-acute COVID-19 patients.","output":"Incomplete Systemic Recovery and Metabolic Phenoreversion in Post-Acute-Phase Nonhospitalized COVID-19 Patients: Implications for Assessment of Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This fifth article in a series on communicable disease outbreaks explores ethical aspects of public health action, information disclosure and research in an epidemic.","output":"Communicable disease outbreaks: Ethics in an outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives.

In the application, we use clinical and genomic data to predict multiple motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients. We conclude that stacked multivariate regression, with our adaptations, is a competitive method for predicting correlated outcomes.

Advanced wound therapies including human skin allografts have shown promise in resolving these challenging wounds. The primary objective of this randomised, prospective study was to compare the response of 100 subjects with non-healing DFUs of which 50 were treated with a cryopreserved bioactive split thickness skin allograft (BSA) (TheraSkin; Misonix,Inc., Farmingdale, NY) compared with 50 subjects treated with standard of care (SOC, collagen alginate dressing) at 12 weeks. Both groups received standardised care that included glucose monitoring, weekly debridement's as appropriate, and an offloading device. The primary endpoint was proportion of full-thickness wounds healed at 12 weeks, with secondary endpoints including differences in percent area reduction (PAR) at 12 weeks, changes in Semmes-Weinstein monofilament score, VAS pain, and w-QoL. The result illustrated in the intent-to-treat analysis at 12 weeks showed that 76% (38/50) of the BSA-treated DFUs healed compared with 36% (18/50) treated with SOC alone (adjusted P = .00056). Mean PAR at 12 weeks was 77.8% in the BSA group compared with 49.6% in the SOC group (adjusted P = .0019). In conclusion, adding BSA to SOC appeared to significantly improve wound healing with a lower incidence of adverse events related to treatment compared with SOC alone.","output":"Multi-centre prospective randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate a bioactive split thickness skin allograft vs standard of care in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Effective therapies for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are needed, and clinical trial data have demonstrated that low-dose dexamethasone reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who required respiratory support. Objective: To estimate the association between administration of corticosteroids compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective meta-analysis that pooled data from 7 randomized clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of corticosteroids in 1703 critically ill patients with COVID-19. The trials were conducted in 12 countries from February 26, 2020, to June 9, 2020, and the date of final follow-up was July 6, 2020. Pooled data were aggregated from the individual trials, overall, and in predefined subgroups. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis of overall mortality, with the association between the intervention and mortality quantified using odds ratios (ORs). Random-effects meta-analyses also were conducted (with the Paule-Mandel estimate of heterogeneity and the Hartung-Knapp adjustment) and an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect analysis using risk ratios. Exposures: Patients had been randomized to receive systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone (678 patients) or to receive usual care or placebo (1025 patients). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. A secondary outcome was investigator-defined serious adverse events. Results: A total of 1703 patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 52-68 years]; 488 [29%] women) were included in the analysis. Risk of bias was assessed as \\"low\\" for 6 of the 7 mortality results and as \\"some concerns\\" in 1 trial because of the randomization method. Five trials reported mortality at 28 days, 1 trial at 21 days, and 1 trial at 30 days. There were 222 deaths among the 678 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 425 deaths among the 1025 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53-0.82]; P < .001 based on a fixed-effect meta-analysis). There was little inconsistency between the trial results (I2 = 15.6%; P = .31 for heterogeneity) and the summary OR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.48-1.01; P = .053) based on the random-effects meta-analysis. The fixed-effect summary OR for the association with mortality was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50-0.82; P < .001) for dexamethasone compared with usual care or placebo (3 trials, 1282 patients, and 527 deaths), the OR was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.43-1.12; P = .13) for hydrocortisone (3 trials, 374 patients, and 94 deaths), and the OR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.29-2.87; P = .87) for methylprednisolone (1 trial, 47 patients, and 26 deaths). Among the 6 trials that reported serious adverse events, 64 events occurred among 354 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 80 events occurred among 342 patients randomized to usual care or placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill patients with COVID-19, administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.","output":"Association Between Administration of Systemic Corticosteroids and Mortality Among Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: A Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lead to a global public health crisis spreading hundreds of countries. With the continuous growth of new infections, developing automated tools for COVID-19 identification with CT image is highly desired to assist the clinical diagnosis and reduce the tedious workload of image interpretation. To enlarge the datasets for developing machine learning methods, it is essentially helpful to aggregate the cases from different medical systems for learning robust and generalizable models. This paper proposes a novel joint learning framework to perform accurate COVID-19 identification by effectively learning with heterogeneous datasets with distribution discrepancy. We build a powerful backbone by redesigning the recently proposed COVID-Net in aspects of network architecture and learning strategy to improve the prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. On top of our improved backbone, we further explicitly tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization in latent space. Moreover, we propose to use a contrastive training objective to enhance the domain invariance of semantic embeddings for boosting the classification performance on each dataset. We develop and evaluate our method with two public large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images.

Microshunt in glaucoma patients. METHODS: Retrospective multicentre cohort study of 100 consecutive eyes (91 patients) from four tertiary-referral glaucoma centres. Four intraocular pressure (IOP) criteria were defined: A: IOP  21 mmHg+IOP reduction 20% from baseline; B: IOP  18 mmHg+IOP reduction 20%; C: IOP  15 mmHg+IOP reduction 25%; D: IOP12 mmHg+IOP reduction 30%. Success was defined as qualified or complete based on whether reached with or without medication. Primary outcome was success according to the above criteria. Secondary outcomes included: IOP, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), medication use, complications, postoperative interventions, and failure-associated factors. RESULTS: Qualified and complete success rates (95% CI) at 12 months were 74%(66C83%) and 58%(49C69%) for criterion A, 72%(63C82%) and 57%(48C68%) for B, 52%(43C63%) and 47%(38C58%) for C, 29%(21C40%) and 26%(19C36%) for D. Overall median (interquartile range (IQR)) preoperative IOP decreased from 21.5(19C28) mmHg to 13(11C16) mmHg at 12 months. BCVA was not significantly different up to 12 months (p = 0.79).

For some people, being exposed to non-traumatic but stressful events could trigger the onset and relapse of mood disorders. Furthermore, non-traumatic stressful events also cause event-related psychological distress (ERPD), similar to that of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; i.e., intense intrusive imagery or memory recall, avoidance, and hyperarousal) in the general population and individuals with mood disorders. However, previous ERPD studies only showed that people with ERPD display PTSD-like symptoms after non-traumatic experiences; they failed to get to the crux of the matter by only utilizing trauma- or PTSD-related assessment tools. We thus aimed to identify the psychological phenomena and features of ERPD after individuals experienced non-traumatic stressful events, and to develop and validate an appropriate ERPD assessment tool. First, we conducted a qualitative study to obtain the psychological features through interviews with 22 individuals (mean age = 41.50 years old, SD = 12.24) with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Second, in the quantitative component, we implemented a web-based survey with 747 participants of the general population (mean age = 41.96 years old, SD = 12.64) by using ERPD-related questionnaires created based on the qualitative study; then, we examined the reliability and validity of the ERPD assessment tool. Results yielded that the psychological features of ERPD comprised four factors: feelings of revenge, rumination, self-denial, and mental paralysis. These were utilized in the developed 24-item measure of ERPD-a novel self-report assessment tool. For various professionals involved in mental healthcare, this tool can be used to clarify and assess psychological phenomena in people with ERPD.","output":"Identification of psychological features and development of an assessment tool for event-related psychological distress after experiencing non-traumatic stressful events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has grown into a pandemic and without a specific cure, disease management is the need of the hour through symptomatic interventions Studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have highlighted the role of herbal medicines either in combination with antiviral drugs or by themselves in curtailing the severity of infection and associated inflammation Divya-Swasari-Vati is an Indian ayurvedic formulation used in the treatment of chronic cough and lung inflammation, which is one of the first symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections Methods: In this study, we used a A549 cell xenotransplant in the swim bladder of zebrafish and modeled the SARS-CoV-2 infection by injecting the fish with a recombinant spike protein The different groups were given normal feed or feed mixed with either dexamethasone (as the control drug) or Divya-Swasari-Vati The changes in behavioral fever, infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in the swim bladder, degeneration or presence of necrotic cells in the kidney, and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were studied to determine the rescue of the diseased phenotype Results: Challenge with the spike protein caused changes in the swim bladder cytology with infiltrating pro-inflammatory cells, skin hemorrhage, and increase in behavioral fever This was also accompanied by increased mortality of the disease control fish Treatment with Divya-Swasari-Vati reversed most of the disease symptoms including damage to the kidney glomerulocytes, and complete reversal of behavioral fever Dexamethasone, used as a comparator, was only able to partly rescue the behavioral fever phenotype Divya-Swasari-Vati also suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, levels in a dose-dependent manner, under in vivo and in vitro conditions Conclusion: The study showed that the A549 xenotransplanted zebrafish injected with the recombinant spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an efficient model for the disease;and treatment with Divya-Swasari-Vati medicine rescued most of the inflammatory damage caused by the viral spike protein while increasing survival of the experimental fish","output":"Calcio-Herbal Medicine Divya-Swasari-Vati Ameliorates SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Pathological Features and Inflammation in Humanized Zebrafish Model by Moderating IL-6 and TNF-alpha Cytokines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To draw real-world evidence about the comparative effectiveness of multiple time-varying treatment regimens on patient survival, we develop a joint marginal structural proportional hazards model and novel weighting schemes in continuous time to account for time-varying confounding and censoring.

This article reviews the characteristics of and responses to the three waves of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021 in order to provide a reference for the next step in epidemic prevention and control. The Japanese Government declared a state of emergency on 7 April 2020, which suppressed the increase in the number of the infected by curtailing economic activity. The first wave peaked at 701 new cases a day and it decreased to 21 new cases on May 25 when the state of emergency was lifted. However, the number of the infected increased again due to the resumption of economic activity, with a peak of 1,762 new cases a day during the second wave. Although the situation was worse than that during the first wave, the government succeeded in limiting the increase without declaring a state of emergency again, and that may be attributed to a decrease in crowd activities and an increase in the number of inspections. During the third wave, the number of the infected continued to exceed the peak during previous waves for two months. Major factors for this rise include the government's implementation of further policies to encourage certain activities, relaxed immigration restrictions, and people not reducing their level of activity. An even more serious problem is the bed usage for patients with COVID-19; bed usage exceeds 50% not only in major cities but also in various areas. On 7 January 2021, 5,953 new cases were reported a day; this greatly exceeded the previous peak, and the state of emergency was declared again. Although Japan has been preparing its medical system since the first wave, maintaining that system has imposed a large economic burden on medical facilities, hence stronger measures and additional support are urgently needed to combat COVID-19 in the coming few months.","output":"Overview of the characteristics of and responses to the three waves of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundMorbidity and mortality of COVID-19 is increased in patients with B-cell depleting therapies, the majority of which also show compromised vaccination-induced immune responses. Herein, we report on the trajectories of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients from the original RituxiVac study compared to healthy volunteers and investigate the immunogenicity of a third vaccination in previously non-responding patients. MethodsA follow-up evaluation was performed in volunteers and patients from the RituxiVac Study (NCT04877496), which investigated the humoral and cell-mediated immune response after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in patients with a history with anti-CD20 depleting therapies (rituximab or ocrelizumab). The current population included 33 patients and 26 healthy volunteers with initial humoral vaccine response and 32 non-responding patients. Primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody trajectories in vaccine responders 4.3 months (median; interquartile range [IQR]: 3.6 - 4.8 months) after first evaluation and humoral responses after a third vaccine dose in previous non-responders. Antibody decay rates were compared using analysis of covariance in linear regression. ResultsIn patients with detectable anti-spike IgG antibodies after two-dose vaccination, circulating anti-spike IgG persisted in 88% (29/33) of patients 5.6 months after the second vaccination (median; IQR: 5.1-6.7) compared to 92% (24/26) of healthy volunteers 6.8 months after the second dose (IQR: 6.0-7.1) (p=0.7). Antibody decay rates were comparable between patients and controls with -0.54 signal/cut-off (s/c) units per month (IQR -0.72 to -0.45) and -0.60 s/c units per month (IQR: -0.88 to -0.44), p=0.70. Two-dose responders with loss of circulating antibodies at follow-up (n=4/33, 12%) had lower initial antibody concentrations (p<0.01). Biomarkers for immunocompetence, including CD3, CD4 or CD19 cell count at baseline did not predict anti-spike IgG persistence. In two-dose non-responders, a third dose of mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 elicited humoral response with detectable anti-spike IgG antibodies in 19% (6/32) participants. No clinical parameters nor biomarkers of immunocompetence predicted humoral response after a third vaccine dose. ConclusionThe present study reveals comparable antibody reduction rates between patients with CD20-depleting treatment history and healthy volunteers, but inefficient humoral responses to a third dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in the majority of two-dose non-responders. There is a need for individually tailored vaccination strategies in immunocompromised patients that could be stratified by B cell counts and initial level of antibody titers.

One key objective when developing these structures is also to accomplish ?-carotene stability. The aim of this review is to collect kinetic data (rate constants, activation energy) on the degradation of encapsulated ?-carotene in order to derive knowledge on the possibility for these systems to be scaled-up to the industrial production of functional foods. Results showed that most of the nano- and micro-structures designed for ?-carotene encapsulation and dispersion in the water phase provide better protection with respect to a natural matrix, such as carrot juice, increasing the ?-carotene half-life from about 30 d to more than 100 d at room temperature. One promising approach to increase ?-carotene stability was found to be the use of wall material, surfactants, or co-encapsulated compounds with antioxidant activity.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective mixed-methods analysis of publicly available Twitter data derived from the publicly available Coronavirus Tweet IDs dataset, March 3, 2020CMay 1, 2020. Original tweets and modified retweets in the dataset by 50 influential EM Twitter users in the US were analyzed using linguistic software to report the emotional tone and temporal viewpoint. We qualitatively analyzed a 25% random subsample and report themes. RESULTS: There were 1315 tweets available in the dataset from 36/50 influential EM Twitter users in the US. The majority of tweets were either positive (455/1315, 34.6%) or neutral (407/1315, 31%) in tone and focused on the present (1009/1315, 76.7%). Qualitative analysis identified six distinct themes, with users most often sharing news or clinical information. CONCLUSIONS: During the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, influential EM Twitter users in the US delivered mainly positive or neutral messages, most often pertaining to news stories or information directly relating to patient care.

Patients with COVID-19 demonstrated quite different appearances and outcomes in clinical manifestations. We aimed to figure out whether risk factors of the cystatin C (CysC) and the CysC rangeability are influencing the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: : 675 T2DM patients and 602 non-T2DM patients were divided into low CysC group, high CysC group and low CysC rangeability group, high CysC rangeability group according to the serum CysC level and the change range of CysC. Demographic characteristics, clinical data and laboratory results of the four groups were collected and analyzed. Results: : Our data showed that COVID-19 patients with high CysC level and CysC rangeability had more organic damage and higher mortality rate compared to those with low level or low rangeability of CysC. Furthermore, patients with higher CysC level and CysC rangeability also demonstrated higher blood lymphocytes (lymph), C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) which may greatly influence disease progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19. After adjusting for possible confounders, multivariate analysis revealed that CysC0.93mg/dl as a reference, CysC0.93mg/dl were significantly associated with the risk of heart failure (OR=2.401, 95% CI: 1.118C5.156) and all-cause death (OR=2.734, 95% CI: 1.098-6.811);referring to CysC rangeability0, CysC rangeability0 significantly associated with all-cause death (OR=4.029, 95% CI: 1.864-8.706). Further grouped by T2DM, these associations were stronger in T2DM than in non-T2DM. Conclusions: : It suggests that CysC level and CysC rangeability contribute to clinical manifestations and may influence the prognosis of COVID-19. The CysC is considered as a potential risk factor of the prognosis of COVID-19. Special medical care and appropriate intervention should be performed in COVID-19 patients with elevated CysC during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially for those with T2DM.","output":"Association Between Cystatin C, Cystatin C Rangeability and Mortality of COVID-19 Patients With or Without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: An Opportunistic Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced incidence of many viral and bacterial infections has been reported in children: bronchiolitis, varicella, measles, pertussis, pneumococcal and meningococcal invasive diseases. The purpose of this opinion paper is to discuss various situations that could lead to larger epidemics when the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) imposed by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will no longer be necessary. While NPIs limited the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they also reduced the spread of other pathogens during and after lockdown periods, despite the re-opening of schools since June 2020 in France. This positive collateral effect in the short term is welcome as it prevents additional overload of the healthcare system. The lack of immune stimulation due to the reduced circulation of microbial agents and to the related reduced vaccine uptake induced an \\"immunity debt\\" which could have negative consequences when the pandemic is under control and NPIs are lifted. The longer these periods of \\"viral or bacterial low-exposure\\" are, the greater the likelihood of future epidemics. This is due to a growing proportion of \\"susceptible\\" people and a declined herd immunity in the population. The observed delay in vaccination program without effective catch-up and the decrease in viral and bacterial exposures lead to a rebound risk of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Due to the high rate of false-negative RT-PCR tests, the role of chest CT examination has been investigated as an auxiliary procedure. The main goal of this work is to establish a well-defined strategy for 3D segmentation of the airways and lungs of COVID-19 positive patients from CT scans, including detected abnormalities. Their identification and the volumetric quantification could allow an easier classification in terms of gravity, extent and progression of the infection. Moreover, these 3D reconstructions can provide a high-impact tool to enhance awareness of the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Segmentation process was performed utilizing a proprietary software, starting from six different stacks of chest CT images of subjects with and without COVID-19. In this context, a comparison between manual and automatic segmentation methods of the respiratory system was conducted, to assess the potential value of both techniques, in terms of time consumption, required anatomical knowledge and branch detection, in healthy and pathological conditions. RESULTS: High-quality 3D models were obtained. They can be utilized to assess the impact of the pathology, by volumetrically quantifying the extension of the affected areas. Indeed, based on the obtained reconstructions, an attempted classification for each patient in terms of the severity of the COVID-19 infection has been outlined. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic algorithms allowed for a substantial reduction in segmentation time. However, a great effort was required for the manual identification of COVID-19 CT manifestations. The developed automated procedure succeeded in obtaining sufficiently accurate models of the airways and the lungs of both healthy patients and subjects with confirmed COVID-19, in a reasonable time.","output":"High-quality chest CT segmentation to assess the impact of COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to analyze initial chest computed tomography (CT) findings in COVID-19 pneumonia and identify features associated with poor prognosis.

Chest CT examinations for ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis were scored by two reviewers. The total CT score comprised the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range; 0, none; 25, maximum). 40 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and six patients who died were enrolled. The initial chest CTs showed 27 (58.7%) patients had ground-glass opacity, 19 (41.3%) had ground glass and consolidation, and 35 (76.1%) patients had crazy-paving pattern. None of the patients who died had fibrosis in contrast to six (15%) patients who recovered from COVID-19.

Refugees face multiple adversities before, during and after escaping from life-threatening situations, political violence, torture and persecution. They present with complex health needs and encounter hostility from host countries and public services, which see their needs as an additional demand on the public purse. Regrettably, existing care practice and training of professionals do not often include skills for working across cultures, including cultural formulations and fair assessment, cultural adaptation of interventions, cultural competence and cultural consultation methods, including clinical ethnography and exploration of cultural identity and explanatory models. There are little data on effective and kind models of interpretation and translation. Care systems are rarely designed to fully address the needs of refugees.

The purpose of this study is to compare the image quality of conventional radiographic views of the traumatized pelvis to virtual radiographs created from pelvic CT scans. METHODS Five patients with acetabular fractures and ten patients with pelvic ring injuries were identified using the orthopedic trauma database at our institution. These fractures were evaluated with both conventional radiographs as well as virtual radiographs generated from a CT scan.

This study also compares the market reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic with the market reactions to the 2008 global financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Morgan Stanley Capital International daily stock indices data and the Carhart and the GARCH(1,1) models for an event study, the authors examine the cumulative abnormal returns during 30 and 10 trading days and the extended 60 days before and after the WHO pandemic announcement. It also compares the market reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic with the reactions to the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy announcement during the 2008 global financial crisis. Findings: This study finds that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly greater negative impact to the stock markets in emerging countries than in the developed countries. The negative impact on the emerging markets is more pronounced for firms with small market capitalizations and for growth stocks. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is stronger in the energy and financial sectors in both emerging and developed markets. The positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in healthcare and telecommunications for the emerging markets and information technology for the developed markets. This study also finds that the equity markets in both emerging and developed countries recovered faster from the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the 2008 global financial crisis. Social implications: Investors' desire to diversify their risks across different countries and sectors in the emerging markets could bring superior returns. The diversification strategies bring critical financial supports to forestall the contagion of COVID-19, to protect lives, and to save the emerging economies, especially for those financially constrained countries that are facing twin health and economic shocks by channeling their investments to countries with weak healthcare systems. Originality/value: This study extends the literature that examines market reactions to stock market shocks by examining the market reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak on the emerging and developed equity markets across different market capitalizations, valuation and sectors. This study also finds that the markets recovered quicker from the COVID-19 pandemic announcement than during the 2008 global financial crisis. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Market reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from emerging markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic.

We consider the optimal allocation of a limited supply of a preventive vaccine to control an infectious disease, and four different allocation objectives: minimize new infections, deaths, life years lost, or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to death. We consider an SIR model with n interacting populations, and a single allocation of vaccine at time 0. We approximate the model dynamics to develop simple analytical conditions characterizing the optimal vaccine allocation for each objective. We instantiate the model for an epidemic similar to COVID-19 and consider n=2 population groups: one group (individuals under age 65) with high transmission but low mortality and the other group (individuals age 65 or older) with low transmission but high mortality. We find that it is optimal to vaccinate younger individuals to minimize new infections, whereas it is optimal to vaccinate older individuals to minimize deaths, life years lost, or QALYs lost due to death. Numerical simulations show that the allocations resulting from our conditions match those found using much more computationally expensive algorithms such as exhaustive search.

This raised concerns about the continuity of care for vulnerable patients. OBJECTIVES: To identify individual and organizational factors associated with the initiatives taken by French GPs to contact vulnerable patients during the lockdown. METHODS: A national observational survey using an online questionnaire was conducted to document French GPs adaptations to the COVID-19 situation, their individual and organizational characteristics, including practice type (individual, group, multidisciplinary) and size. Data were collected from 7th to 20th May 2020 using mailing lists of GPs from the study partners and GPs who participated in a previous survey. This paper analysed answers to the question exploring whether and how GPs took initiatives to contact vulnerable patients. Responses were categorized in: no initiative; selection of patients to contact with a criteria-based strategy; initiative of contact without criteria-based strategy. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression identified factors associated with each category. Key components of the reported initiatives were described by inductive analysis of verbatim material. RESULTS: Among the 3012 participant GPs (~ 5.6% of French GPs), 1419 (47.1%) reported initiatives to contact some patients without criteria-based strategy, and 808 (26.8%) with a strategy using various clinical/psychological/social criteria. Women GPs more often declared initiatives of contacts with a criteria-based strategy (OR = 1.41, 95% CI [1.14-1.75]) as well as GPs with more than two patients who died due to COVID-19 in comparison with those having none (OR = 1.84, 95% CI [1.43-2.36]). Teaching GPs more often used criteria-based strategies than the other GPs (OR = 1.94, 95% CI [1.51-2.48]). Compared with those working in small monodisciplinary practice, GPs working alone were less likely to implement criteria-based initiatives of contacts (OR = 0.70, 95% CI [0.51-0.97]), while GPs working in multidisciplinary practice were more likely (OR = 1.94, 95% CI [1.26-2.98] in practices > 20 professionals). CONCLUSION: French GPs took various initiatives to keep in touch with vulnerable patients, more frequently when working in group practices.

Antibody responses of 101 individuals were measured on capillary blood, venous whole blood, plasma, and diluted plasma samples directly on the POC. Results were available within 7 min. As the reference, plasma samples were analyzed on DiaSorin LIAISON XL CLIA analyzer using LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 IgM, LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assays. The Spearman ranks correlation coefficient between ViroTrack Sero COVID-19 Total Ab and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assays was found to be 0.83 and 0.89, respectively. ViroTrack Sero COVID-19 Total Ab showed high correlation between the different matrixes.

The first part of the review provides an overview of vitamin D metabolism, with particular reference to the role of various proteins (25- and 1-hydroxylases, vitamin D binding protein, vitamin D receptor) in vitamin D signalling. The second part deals with the role of the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in plasma as an indicator of the vitamin D status in dairy cows, and its dependence on sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D supplementation. In this part also the \\"free hormone hypothesis\\" is discussed, indicating that the concentration of free 25(OH)D might be a more valid indicator of the vitamin D status than the concentration of total 25(OH)D.

Most hospitalists (75%; n=115/154) reported concerns about contracting COVID-19 infection at work, and 5% (n=8/154) reported changing where they lived during the pandemic. Most hospitalists (73%; n=112/154) reported relying primarily on institutional resources for COVID-19 information. During the pandemic, the percentage of participants with excellent or very good global well-being decreased (90% prior to pandemic vs. 53% during pandemic), with increases in mean anxiety (-4.88 [95% confidence interval, -5.61 to -4.16]; P<.001) and social isolation (-3.91[95% confidence interval, -4.68 to -3.13]; P<.001). During the same period, there was a small decrease in mean emotional support (1.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 2.09]; P<.001). CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, Internal Medicine hospitalists reported lower global well-being, higher anxiety and social isolation, and a small decrease in emotional support. These results provide a framework to develop programs to support hospitalists and potentially mitigate long-term psychological sequelae including burnout.","output":"Psychological wellness of internal medicine hospitalists during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the world was struck by the unprecedented medical uncertainty that we now know as COVID-19, forcing many people into quarantine conditions While the physiological impact of the pandemic is serious, this paper explores how privacy has been affected by COVID-19 In this paper, we explore the ways the ongoing pandemic has affected privacy ranging from the changes in privacy policy and regulation, through use of personal data for contact tracing and privacy in the technologies that have taken centre stage as we all work from home The articles cited in this paper form an empirical basis of the observations we make We use the information available to us to analyse the privacy concerns and draw conclusions ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Privacy in time of a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic complications due to systemic coagulation activation.

To examine whether the knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with the general health literacy among patients in an emergency department, and to demonstrate whether patients primary source of COVID-19 information was associated with their COVID-19 knowledge. Methods: A sample of adults was collected in an urban ED. Patients knowledge of COVID-19 was measured by the agreement to 10 statements. Health literacy was measured by the Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS). Participants were also asked about their primary source of COVID-19 information, sociodemographics, comorbidities and familiarity with the healthcare system at baseline. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results: The average COVID-19 knowledge score was 7.09 (range 0-10) and BHLS score, 11.09 (range 3-15). About 43% obtained the information primarily from TVs, radios and newspapers, and 1/3 from social media and circles. The group with the primary source being internet searches and sites had the highest average COVID-19 knowledge score of 7.78. The BHLS and COVID-19 knowledge scores were positively correlated in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Education and income levels were statistically significant in the multivariate regression. Conclusions: To better prevent further increases in COVID-19 transmission, community-based interventions can be more cost-effective when targeting sociodemographic groups that have lower general health literacy.

The problem of distinguishing these two parameterizations of the model becomes more severe in the presence of effective mitigation measures.

Simultaneous treatment of the cells with camostat and EST [(23,25)trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamindo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester], a cathepsin inhibitor, efficiently prevented both cell entry and the multistep growth of SARS-CoV in human Calu-3 airway epithelial cells. This efficient inhibition could be attributed to the dual blockade of entry from the cell surface and through the endosomal pathway.

The clinical manifestations and computed tomography (CT) findings of these patients were examined. The conversion of RT-PCR test results in these two patients may be related to false-negative and false-positive outcomes of the test. CT images helped track improvement of pulmonary lesions.

To capture the prevalence in an accurate and timely manner and to understand the mode of nosocomial infection are essential for its preventive measure. METHODS: We recruited 685 healthcare workers (HCWs) at Tokyo Shinagawa Hospital prior to the vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine. Sera of the subjects were tested by assays for the titer of IgG against S proteins receptor binding domain (IgG (RBD)) or IgG against nucleocapsid protein (IgG (N)) of SARS-CoV-2. Together with PCR data, the positive rates by these methods were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall positive rates among HCWs by PCR, IgG (RBD), IgG (N) with a cut-off of 1.4 S/C (IgG (N)(1.4)), and IgG (N) with a cut-off of 0.2 S/C (IgG (N)(0.2)) were 3.5%, 9.5%, 6.1%, and 27.7%, respectively. Positive rates of HCWs working in COVID-19 ward were significantly higher than those of HCWs working in non-COVID-19 ward by all the four methods. Concordances of IgG (RBD), IgG (N)(1.4), and IgG (N)(0.2) against PCR were 97.1%, 71.4%, and 88.6%, respectively. By subtracting the positive rates of PCR from that of IgG (RBD), the rate of overall silent infection and that of HCWs in COVID-19 ward were estimated to be 6.0% and 21.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the prevention of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2, identification of silent infection is essential. For the detection of ongoing infection, periodical screening with IgG (RBD) in addition to PCR would be an effective measure. For the surveillance of morbidity in the population, on the other hand, IgG (N)(0.2) could be the most reliable indicator among the three serological tests.","output":"Detection of silent infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by serological tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growing interest in issues to do with the administration, enhancement and sale of public building stock has increased the need for their valuation and, as a result, has increasingly highlighted the need to identify suitable methods for estimating value that take into account the peculiarities of public buildings. In Italy, public buildings often boast special architectural features (interfloor distance, layout, finishings, type of wiring/heating systems, etc.) that render them extra-ordinary assets; in some cases, these features also confer grand and/or historical importance to such buildings. Thus when carrying out valuation work in Italy, it is necessary to adopt suitable valuation methods designed for buildings boasting special features prior to drafting any administration plans, enhancement projects or even plans for the sale of public building stock. Given the lack of comparable examples or income-based parameters specifically concerning buildings with special features, the Cost Approach is the only method that can be used to estimate the market value of such properties. This paper aims to identify the ways the Cost Approach can be applied when estimating the market value of properties with special features that fall into the extra-ordinary category.

Heterozygous carriers of rare coding variants of ONECUT1 define a distinctive subgroup of diabetic patients with early-onset, nonautoimmune diabetes, who respond well to diabetes treatment. In addition, common regulatory ONECUT1 variants are associated with multifactorial type 2 diabetes. Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells revealed that loss of ONECUT1 impairs pancreatic progenitor formation and a subsequent endocrine program. Loss of ONECUT1 altered transcription factor binding and enhancer activity and NKX2.2/NKX6.1 expression in pancreatic progenitor cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that ONECUT1 controls a transcriptional and epigenetic machinery regulating endocrine development, involved in a spectrum of diabetes, encompassing monogenic (recessive and dominant) as well as multifactorial inheritance.

They incur significant patient morbidity and health care costs. Negative-pressure dressings (NPDs) applied over closed incisions may minimize wound complications. However, its utility in the emergency setting is unknown. Here, we examined whether prophylactic NPD reduces wound complications after emergency laparotomies. METHODS This is a retrospective review of consecutive emergency laparotomies undertaken at a university hospital from January 2018 to October 2019. Outcomes included the rate of SSI, wound breakdown, hospital-outreach service utilization, wound-related readmissions, and length of stay. Propensity score matched analysis was used to assess bias. RESULTS A total of 227 emergency laparotomies were reviewed, 70 received NPD and 157 had conventional dressings (controls). SSI was identified in 33 (21.0%) patients from the control group and six (8.6%) from the NPD group (odds ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.85, P = 0.022). Wound breakdown was observed in 21 (13.4%) patients from the control group and three (4.3%) from the NPD group (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.91, P = 0.040). The prophylactic benefit of NPD was most evident in clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty wounds. The NPD group had comparatively shorter postoperative stay, less outreach service utilization, and lower rates of wound-related readmissions. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that increasing age, body weight >75 kg, and wound contamination are independent predictors of wound complications, whereas NPD prevented SSI and wound breakdown. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic NPD significantly reduced wound complications after emergency laparotomy. This was associated with a substantial health resource saving.

METHODS: From August 22 to 30, 2021, a convenient sampling method was used in Zhangjiajie City, Hunan Province, China. A total of 248 frontline nurses who performed nucleic acid sample collection were selected. The following tests were used: the general information questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI), and DepressionCAnxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: A total of 236 nurses completed the survey; 88.14% (n = 208) were women, the average age was 33.026.81, the PSQI score was 15 (13C17), and 231 (97.88%) nurses had sleep disorders during the period in Zhangjiajie, 219 nurses (81.36%) had anxiety, 135 nurses (45.76%) had depression, and 112 nurses (42.59%) felt stressed. Spearman correlation analysis was used to associate the PSQI with the DASS-21. The results showed that the use of hypnotic drugs was negatively correlated with DASS-21 (P<0.05), while the rest were positively correlated. The results of the multivariate analysis of sleep disorders showed that depression, anxiety, and stress were related to sleep quality (P<0.05), and there was no statistical difference in the other variables. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sleep quality and depression-anxiety-stress state of the frontline nurses performing nucleic acid testing were adversely affected.

Objective To assess the impacts and lessons learned from the local production of WHO-recommended alcohol-based hand rub during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Uganda. Method Space for local production was identified at a health facility in Central Uganda that was air-conditioned and well ventilated. Volunteers were trained on the local production of ABHR. The volunteers were trained theoretically and practically for Four days;and each was able to produce at least a batch of ABHR. Logistical support for supplying the raw materials needed for production was from the Infectious Diseases Institute. There were also already established ABHR production units and trained staff on local production of ABHR in 2019 in the Kabarole and Kasese districts, respectively in Western Uganda. These districts were threatened by several outbreaks, including Ebola virus disease, and were monitored for ABHR production during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Result Two production units were set up during the Ebola outbreak, in awake of COVID-19, a production unit in Kasese, was able to produce 3020 litres, and the Kabarole unit produced 2020 litres respectively. A new production unit was set up at Kasangati HCIV in central Uganda and eight laboratory technologists trained on Local Production of ABHR, and within Eleven days they were able to produce 2300ltrs.

Although evidence shows that improving gender equality contributes to the achievement of health outcomes, gender-based constraints faced by CHWs working with social enterprises in Africa have not yet been empirically studied. This study is the first of its kind to address this important gap in knowledge. METHODS: We conducted 36 key informant interviews and 21 focus group discussions between 2016 and 2019 (for a total of 175 individuals: 106 women and 69 men) with four health social enterprises in Uganda and Kenya and other related key stakeholders and domain experts. Interview and focus group transcripts were coded according to gender-based constraints and strategies for enhanced performance as well as key sites for intervention. RESULTS: We found that CHW programs can be more gender responsive. We introduce the Gender Integration Continuum for Health Social Enterprises as a tool that can help guide gender equality efforts. Data revealed female CHWs face seven unique gender-based constraints (compared to male CHWs): 1) higher time burden and lack of economic empowerment; 2) risks to personal safety; 3) lack of career advancement and leadership opportunities; 4) lack of access to needed equipment, medicines and transport; 5) lack of access to capital; 6) lack of access to social support and networking opportunities; and 7) insufficient financial and non-financial incentives. Data also revealed four key areas of intervention: 1) the health social enterprise; 2) the CHW; 3) the CHWs partner; and 4) the CHWs patients. In each of the four areas, gender responsive strategies were identified to overcome constraints and contribute to improved gender equality and community health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of its kind to identify the key gender-based constraints and gender responsive strategies for health social enterprises in Africa using CHWs.

A growing body of literature identifies religion and spirituality as sources of coping mechanisms for emotional distress during the pandemic, in that they enable individuals to find ways to improve subjective well-being and quality of life. The study uses a descriptive phenomenological approach, drawing upon narratives collected between September 2020 and June 2021 from thirty-two respondents composed of a mix of religious-affiliated and self-identified non-religious women practising temple meditation and yoga. Findings indicate that more women, including religious affiliates, have favoured spiritual coping mechanisms in the forms of meditation and bodyCmind practices to build emotional resilience. This reflects a quest for greater subjective well-being to compensate for the increased burden of emotional care during the pandemic.

To understand the levels of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n = 5,100) were sampled at random between 14 March 2020 and 28 February 2021. METHODS: In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n = 2,600) and pregnant women (n = 2,500) were sampled for consecutive weeks (at four intervals) throughout the study period. Sera from all participants and a cohort of historical (negative) controls (n = 595) were screened for IgG responses against stabilized trimers of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the smaller receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard analytical approaches, a probabilistic (cut-off independent) Bayesian framework that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyse data over time. SETTING: Healthy participant samples were randomly selected from their respective pools through Karolinska University Hospital. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority: registration number 2020-01807. PARTICIPANTS: No participants were symptomatic at sampling, and blood donors were all over the age of 18. No additional metadata were available from the participants. RESULTS: Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 13 December 2020. By the end of February 2021, 19% of the population tested seropositive. Notably, 96% of seropositive healthy donors screened (n = 56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titres comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in the first year since the start of community transmission, seropositivity levels in metropolitan in Stockholm had reached approximately one in five persons, providing important baseline seroprevalence information prior to the start of vaccination.","output":"Seropositivity in blood donors and pregnant women during the first year of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Stockholm, Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights C as well as the possibility of controlling the system C may be compromised. Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements.","output":"Structural identifiability and observability of compartmental models of the COVID-19 pandemic()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Deaths from COVID-19 depend on millions of people understanding risk and translating this understanding into risk-reduction behaviors.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: ITS community programs responsive to COVID-19 include:  Ongoing communication with community and business stakeholders  Social media and public health campaigns promoting safe practices, research updates, and testing information  Community initiatives to increase testing among vulnerable populations METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Like sister hubs across the US, the UTMB ITS has brought available resources to bear on addressing COVID-19 through research, medical response, and public health outreach. Community engagement activities have included facilitating communication, particularly by rapidly translating information for multiple audiences and wherever possible and appropriate, providing opportunities for the patients voice to inform and guide development of research. We realized the communitys need for trustworthy and reliable information about COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Key partnerships with community members and organizations were critical in enabling us all to be most responsive in meeting these needs. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: ITS community outreach included developing infographics, media notices, and educational materials related to prevention and testing as well as appropriate use of PPE. These efforts resulted in an article in a regional newspaper, which was disseminated widely through social media networks. ITS faculty also engaged doctoral and MPH trainees to support the Health Districts contact tracing effort. We held several events on mental health impacts as well as discussions related to health disparities. Both activities shaped plans for community-based interventions and research. The ITS also hosted a virtual workshop to facilitate discussion around key research questions related to the pandemic.

Proportions of individuals reporting unmet healthcare needs were similar (68.4% vs. 69.8%). The main reason invoked for these unmet needs was lacking money (80.6%). Situations of not working or studying, not having had enough food in the past 12 months, not having a medical prescription to get medication and having had a workplace injury were all significantly associated with higher odds of having unmet healthcare needs. Unmet healthcare needs were more frequent among migrants without healthcare coverage than among recent immigrants or the citizens with health healthcare coverage (69%, 26%, 16%). Canada must take measures to enable these individuals to have access to healthcare according to their needs in order to reduce the risk of worsening their health status, something that may have an impact on the healthcare system and population health.

The global scientific community has responded rapidly to understand immune correlates of protection to develop vaccines and immunotherapeutics against the virus. The major goal of this mini review is to summarize current understanding of the structural landscape of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) glycoprotein. The RBD plays a critical role in the very first step of the virus life cycle. Better understanding of where and how nAbs bind the RBD should enable identification of sites of vulnerability and facilitate better vaccine design and formulation of immunotherapeutics. Towards this goal, we compiled 38 RBD-binding nAbs with known structures. Review of these nAb structures showed that (1) nAbs can be divided into five general clusters, (2) there are distinct non-neutralizing faces on the RBD, and (3) maximum of potentially four nAbs could bind the RBD simultaneously. Since most of these nAbs were isolated from virus-infected patients, additional analyses of vaccine-induced nAbs could facilitate development of improved vaccines.","output":"A Structural Landscape of Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization reported the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which rapidly evolved to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the virus has also rapidly spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study is to identify new emerging COVID-19 clusters over time and space (from January 21 to mid-May 2020) in Latin American, Caribbean, and African regions, using a prospective space-time scan measurement approach. The second aim is to assess the impact of real-time population mobility patterns between January 21 and May 18, 2020, under the implemented government interventions, measurements, and policy restrictions on COVID-19 spread among those regions and worldwide. METHODS: We created a global COVID-19 database, of 218 countries and territories, merging the World Health Organization daily case reports with other measures such as population density and country income levels for January 21 to May 18, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created for low, intermediate, high, and very high interventions. The population's mobility patterns at the country level were obtained from Google community mobility reports. The prospective space-time scan statistic method was applied in five time periods between January and May 2020, and a regression mixed model analysis was used. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 emerging clusters within these five periods of time increased from 7 emerging clusters to 28 by mid-May 2020. We also detected various increasing and decreasing relative risk estimates of COVID-19 spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries within the period of analysis. Globally, population mobility to parks and similar leisure areas during at least a minimum of implemented intermediate-level control policies (when compared to low-level control policies) was related to accelerated COVID-19 spread. Results were almost consistent when regional stratified analysis was applied. In addition, worldwide population mobility due to working during high implemented control policies and very high implemented control policies, when compared to low-level control policies, was related to positive COVID-19 spread. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective space-time scan is an approach that low-income and middle-income countries could use to detect emerging clusters in a timely manner and implement specific control policies and interventions to slow down COVID-19 transmission. In addition, real-time population mobility obtained from crowdsourced digital data could be useful for current and future targeted public health and mitigation policies at a global and regional level.","output":"Estimating the COVID-19 Spread Through Real-time Population Mobility Patterns: Surveillance in Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS coronavirus ORF6 inhibits the classical nuclear import pathway to antagonize host antiviral responses. Several models were proposed to explain its inhibitory function, but quantitative measurement is needed for model evaluation and refinement. We report a broadly applicable live-cell method for calibrated dose-response characterization of the nuclear transport alteration by a protein of interest. Using this method, we found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is 5 times more potent than SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 in inhibiting bidirectional nuclear transport, due to differences in the NUP98-binding C-terminal region that is required for the inhibition. The N-terminal region was also required, but its membrane binding function was dispensable, since loss of the inhibitory function due to N-terminal truncation was rescued by forced oligomerization using a soluble construct. Based on these data, we propose that the hydrophobic N-terminal region drives oligomerization of ORF6 to multivalently cross-link the FG domains of NUP98 at the nuclear pore complex.","output":"Quantification of nuclear transport inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 using a broadly applicable live-cell dose-response pipeline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we suggest an approach to analysing policies relating to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic We discuss the formulation of policy and sketch how the approach can be applied to different specific challenges as policymakers try to make difficult choices for managing the pandemic and protecting the economy and society","output":"The Economics of Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose/Relevance: New technologies are rapidly emerging in all fields, especially in the COVID-19 era, including pediatric ophthalmology.

We aimed to investigate the impact of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic on the management and outcome of the patients with TIA. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from a registry of consecutive TIA patients assessed at the Stroke Department, Imperial College Health Care Trust, London, during the national lockdown period (between March 23 2020 and 30 June 2020). As controls, we evaluated the clinical reports and stroke quality metrics of patients presenting to the TIA clinic in the same period of 2019. RESULTS: Between 23 March 2020 and 30 June 2020, 136 patients were assessed using the telemedicine TIA clinic, compared to 180 patients evaluated with face-to-face consultation in the same period in 2019. Patients' characteristics were similar in both groups. At 3 months after the TIA, there were no significant differences in the proportion of patients admitted to the hospital for recurrent TIA/stroke or any other cardiovascular cause from the 2020 period compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that during the pandemic, our telemedicine consultations of TIA patients were not associated with an increased 3-month rate of recurrent TIA/stroke or cardiovascular hospital admissions.

First, the 2-tuple spherical linguistic term sets (TSLTSs) are employed by decision makers to express their uncertain and vague evaluation information on emergency alternatives. Then, an integrated EDM method based on regret theory and EDAS method is proposed to rank emergency alternatives and find out the optimal one. Besides, the criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) method is used to determine criteria weights objectively in the EDM process. Finally, the proposed regret theory-EDAS method is applied to select the optimal response solution for a public health emergency in China.

The impact of pneumonia development on the time to viral clearance in mild COVID-19 patients was evaluated. Risk factors associated with the development of pneumonia were also identified. RESULTS: Chest radiographs revealed the development of pneumonia in 26.8% of mild COVID-19 patients. The time to pneumonia development was a median of 8.0 days from the onset of symptoms and 3.5 days after hospital admission. A multivariate analysis for predicting pneumonia development identified age  65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 8.73), cough (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.29 to 3.68), dyspnea (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.10 to 11.69), and diarrhea (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.51 to 4.78) as significant variables.

Additionally, such location annotated datasets can provide a pathway for deep learning models to be used for downstream tasks. However, acquiring quality annotations is expensive on human resources and usually requires domain expertise. On the other hand, medical reports contain a plethora of information both about pnuemonia characteristics and its location. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised attention-driven deep learning model that leverages encoded information in medical reports during training to facilitate better localization. Our model also performs classification of attributes that are associated to pneumonia and extracted from medical reports for supervision. Both the classification and localization are trained in conjunction and once trained, the model can be utilized for both the localization and characterization of pneumonia using only the input image. In this paper, we explore and analyze the model using chest X-ray datasets and demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the introduction of textual information improves pneumonia localization. We showcase quantitative results on two datasets, MIMIC-CXR and Chest X-ray-8, and we also showcase severity characterization on COVID-19 dataset. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Improving Pneumonia Localization via Cross-Attention on Medical Images and Reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, a simulation of the policy implementation is provided.

The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontarios COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. METHODS: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables. We adjusted models for age, sex, time, vaccination status, comorbidities and pregnancy status. We included health units as random intercepts. RESULTS: Our cohort included 212 326 people. Compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42%C63%) for hospitalization, 89% (95% CI 67%C117%) for ICU admission and 51% (95% CI 30%C78%) for death. Increased risk with the Delta variant was more pronounced at 108% (95% CI 78%C140%) for hospitalization, 235% (95% CI 160%C331%) for ICU admission and 133% (95% CI 54%C231%) for death. INTERPRETATION: The increasing virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will lead to a considerably larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of the emergence of VOCs.","output":"Evaluation of the relative virulence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants: a retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Now in the fourth month of their pilot effort to respond to some mental health crisis calls without a police presence, leaders of Denver's Support Team Assisted Response (STAR) program can point to one rather remarkable statistic As of early last week, not one of the more than 400 calls for service that the program's teams of a social worker and a paramedic have responded to have required a follow-up call for police assistance","output":"Crisis response in Denver progresses, with many other communities watching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of booster vaccination of adults with measles-mumps-rubella in the COVID-19 infection rates Methods: In order to investigate this hypothesis, we tested COVID-19 positivity rate through PCR assay on the participants (n=245;male), who had to share the same student accommodation together with the same dining hall to provide governmental service Participants were divided into two groups based on their booster vaccination status with measles-mumps-rubella: the non-vaccinated group (n=207) and the vaccinated group (n=38) The rate of COVID-19 seropositivity, age, body mass index (BMI), active smoking and presence of comorbidity were also measured and recorded Results: All of the participants were healthy, and age distribution, comorbidity rates, active smoking status and BMI did not vary significantly among the two groups (p=0 305, p=0 594, p=0 280, and p=0 922, respectively) About 36 7% (n=90) of the participants were found to be COVID-19 positive by PCR among which the non-vaccinated cases had higher rates of COVID-19 seropositivity than the vaccinated cases (40 6% vs 15 8%) (OR=3 6, 95%CI: 1 5-9 0, p=0 004) Conclusion: Based on these results, we cautiously predict that immunity produced by MMR vaccination boosters may provide some degree of protection against COVID-19 in the adult population","output":"Effectiveness of Booster Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccination in Lower COVID-19 Infection Rates: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Turkish Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In South Africa (SA), exclusive breast feeding remains rare, with breast-milk substitutes (BMS) commonly being used in ways that are detrimental to infant and young child nutrition, health and survival.

This paper aims to provide pertinent examples of how BMS manufacturers in SA use social media to market their products thus violating national regulations. A digital (and social media) ethnography approach was used to study BMS organisations activity on Facebook and Instagram. Purposively selected examples of social media posts observed (from 2015 to 2019) were included, and content analysed in terms of national legislation. Several examples of BMS social media marketing are presented and interpreted according to provisions of national regulations that they violate. BMS manufacturers have found ways on social media to market their products in a media space that is complex to regulate, and where it is difficult to enforce national regulations. It is necessary to engage with stakeholders, notably social media companies, to alert them to relevant regulations applicable to their platforms.

METHODS: Data from the, an anonymous, cross-sectional internet survey among MSM in July 2020, were analysed. Among respondents who were using PrEP prior to the lockdown, a binary logistic regression model was used to compare participants who were still taking PrEP (current PrEP users) with those who were not taking PrEP at the time of the survey (former PrEP users). RESULTS: Among 8345 respondents, 946 were PrEP users before the lockdown, of whom 58.8% (n=556) reported stopping PrEP during the lockdown and 15.4% (n=146) were not using PrEP at the time of the survey. Among the 556 who stopped PrEP during lockdown, 86.5% (n=481) reported no sexual activity;76.8% (n=427) restarted PrEP after lockdown. Former PrEP users were more likely to be younger, not living with a stable male sexual partner, report moderate anxiety, report increased psychoactive drug use during the lockdown, and report not having tested for HIV or STI since the end of the lockdown because they did not know where to go, preferred to wait or for another reason. Reporting fewer male sexual partners in the last 6 months was also significantly associated with being a former PrEP user. CONCLUSIONS: MSM adapted PrEP use to their sexual activity during and after the French lockdown. After the lockdown, discontinued PrEP occurred more often among MSM who had fewer sexual partners and had mental health vulnerabilities.

For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to -0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.","output":"Taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study examined the association between job loss during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the Japanese working population and whether universal financial support program has a protective influence on the HRQOL. Two self-reported internet surveys were used to determine job loss during the pandemic: one was conducted between February and March 2020, just before the COVID-19 emergency declaration by the Japanese government (April 2020), and the other was conducted between August and September 2020. For the dependent variable, we used the EQ-5D-5L utility score (QOL utility score), which was assessed between August and September 2020. The independent variables were job loss after the state of emergency was declared and two types of government financial support (either universal support or support targeting child-raising households). The Tobit regression model was applied, adjusting for covariates. Job loss during the pandemic was negatively associated with the QOL utility score in the fully adjusted model; the coefficient (95% confidence interval [CI]) for job loss during the pandemic was -0.07 (-0.11 to -0.03). For the government financial support variables, the universal financial support program was associated with a better QOL utility score of the coefficient (95% CI), 0.05 (0.03 to 0.08). Job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively associated with HRQOL, while universal financial support is positively associated with HRQOL. Our study results imply that universal financial support during the COVID-19 era has a protective influence on an individual's HRQOL.

A similar, structured approach appears to improve outcomes, including mortality, for patients undergoing high-risk emergency general surgery, and specifically emergency laparotomy. These are the first consensus guidelines for optimal care of these patients using an ERAS approach. METHODS Experts in aspects of management of the high-risk and emergency general surgical patient were invited to contribute by the International ERAS? Society. Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE database searches on English language publications were performed for ERAS elements and relevant specific topics. Studies on each item were selected with particular attention to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large cohort studies, and reviewed and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Recommendations were made on the best level of evidence, or extrapolation from studies on non-emergency patients when appropriate. The Delphi method was used to validate final recommendations. The guideline has been divided into two parts: Part 1-Preoperative Care and Part 2-Intraoperative and Postoperative management. This paper provides guidelines for Part 1. RESULTS Twelve components of preoperative care were considered. Consensus was reached after three rounds. CONCLUSIONS These guidelines are based on the best available evidence for an ERAS approach to patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Initial management is particularly important for patients with sepsis and physiological derangement. These guidelines should be used to improve outcomes for these high-risk patients.","output":"Guidelines for Perioperative Care for Emergency Laparotomy Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society Recommendations: Part 1-Preoperative: Diagnosis, Rapid Assessment and Optimization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several randomized clinical trials have shown that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) applied immediately after extubation may prevent reintubation in patients at high-risk of extubation failure. However, most of studies included patients with chronic respiratory disorders as well as patients without underlying respiratory disease. To date, no study has shown decreased risk of reintubation with prophylactic NIV after extubation among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We hypothesized that prophylactic NIV after extubation may decrease the risk of reintubation in COPD patients as compared with high-flow nasal oxygen. We performed a post hoc subgroup analysis of COPD patients included in a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing prophylactic use of NIV alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen versus high-flow nasal oxygen alone immediately after extubation. RESULTS: Among the 651 patients included in the original study, 150 (23%) had underlying COPD including 86 patients treated with NIV alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen and 64 patients treated with high-flow nasal oxygen alone. The reintubation rate was 13% (11 out of 86 patients) with NIV and 27% (17 out of 64 patients) with high-flow nasal oxygen alone [difference, ? 14% (95% CI ? 27% to ? 1%); p = 0.03]. Whereas reintubation rates were significantly lower with NIV than with high-flow nasal oxygen alone at 72 h and until ICU discharge, mortality in ICU did not differ between groups: 6% (5/86) with NIV vs. 9% (6/64) with high-flow nasal oxygen alone [difference ? 4% (95% CI ? 14% to 5%); p = 0.40].

The threat of bioterrorism is increasing daily.

Health professionals in emergency departments are expected to play crucial roles in the management of victims of bioterrorism when bioterrorism occurs. This study explored the knowledge, attitudes, and preparedness of emergency department nurses and medical officers (MOs) toward potential bioterrorist attacks in Ghana. This qualitative study utilized focus group discussions and semistructured interviews to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and preparedness of emergency department nurses and MOs toward potential bioterrorist attacks in Ghana. Data were subjected to a qualitative content analysis in which three main thematic categories were developed. These thematic categories are as follows: (a) differences in bioterrorism knowledge between emergency department nurses and emergency department MOs, (b) unprepared emergency department nurses and MOs for care during bioterrorism attacks, and (c) positive attitudes of emergency department nurses and MOs toward bioterrorism preparedness. Although emergency MOs had better knowledge of bioterrorism than their nursing counterparts, both groups of health professionals were unprepared to respond to any form of bioterrorism. Both nurses and MOs indicated the need for staff education and infrastructure readiness to be able to respond effectively to a bioterrorist attack.

All nursing decisions had to be innovatively made and measures taken by nurses using their existing knowledge and skills. This required nurses to have a solid theoretical understanding of infectious diseases and epidemiology, evidence-based solid practice skills, and problem-solving skills. The COVID outbreak reminded undergraduates to master relevant knowledge and abilities during school study. METHODS: Qualitative research on knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of the COVID-19 epidemic was conducted using semi-structured interviews among sophomore nursing students in the university. Based on the characteristics of the KAP of nursing students, we analyzed the deficiencies of the knowledge and ability to deal with large-scale public health emergencies in the second-year nursing education. RESULTS: A total of 12 subject headings and 41 sublevel headings were identified from three aspects of KAP. The subject headings included knowledge aspect (the origin of the disease, the route of transmission, main symptoms, the epidemiological characteristics of the disease, scientific cognition of information sources), attitude aspect (different emotional experiences, a certain degree of influence, different views on the development trend of the epidemic, support the government's prevention and control strategies), and behavior aspect (do an excellent job in self-protection, help family members to protect, and participate in social anti-epidemic actions). According to this analysis, second-year nursing students have three deficiencies in dealing with large-scale public health emergencies: knowledge of infectious diseases and epidemiology, evidence-based practice skills, and problem- solving ability. CONCLUSION: When students start nursing professional courses, the knowledge of infectious diseases and epidemiology, training of evidence-based practice skills, and problem-solving ability should be strengthened to improve the ability of nursing undergraduates to respond to large-scale public health emergencies after entering the workplace.","output":"A Qualitative Study on Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Nursing Students in the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Epidemic and Inspiration for Nursing Education in Mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While tourism scholars have sought to problematize the unevenly distributed impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we know much less about how resilience is cultivated among tourism practitioners and communities whose lives and livelihoods are have been placed in limbo. Drawing on literature at the intersection of critical tourism studies and resilience theory as well as interviews with local tourism practitioners and academics, four historically situated and place-based trends in Southeast Asia that are reshaping tourism in the region are outlined: livelihood diversification, ecosystem regeneration, cultural revitalization, and domestic tourism development. These trends highlight how the political economy of tourism in the region has both challenged and facilitated opportunities for reshaping the industry in (post-) pandemic times. These interconnected trends should not be understood in silo but rather as historically rooted and place-based experiences. The examples of resilience among Southeast Asian residents presented in the article demonstrate that local individuals and communities are active agents in resilience. While the concept of resilience has been applied widely by scholars from multiple disciplines during the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical tourism studies approach to resilience theory accounts for the historically situated nuances of local scale dynamics and their relationship to macro-level processes. Rather than simply focusing on the pandemic's sudden transformative effects, practices of resilience in Southeast Asia reflect ongoing political-economic and cultural shifts that have often been underway in the region for several decades.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected in feces of patients. We investigated gastrointestinal symptoms and shedding of virus into feces of patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. METHODS: We collected data from 46 patients (median age, 26 y; 46% men) with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 (without fever and pneumonia) and prolonged respiratory shedding of SARS-CoV-2, quarantined from April 4, 2020, through April 24, 2020, in Korea. Respiratory specimens included upper respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory specimens (sputum), and were collected twice per week. The median interval between COVID-19 diagnosis to the start of fecal sample collection was 37 days (range, 29-41 d); 213 stool specimens were collected from 46 patients. We used real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory and fecal specimens. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal manifestations were observed in 16 of the 46 patients (35%); diarrhea was the most common (15%), followed by abdominal pain (11%), dyspepsia (11%), and nausea (2%). Virus RNA was detected in feces from 2 patients without gastrointestinal symptoms (4%). Mean cycle threshold values from the time of quarantine to the time of fecal collection tended to be lower in patients with virus detected in fecal samples than in patients without virus in fecal samples (29.91 vs 33.67 in the first week, 29.47 vs 35.71 in the fifth week, respectively). Shedding of virus into feces persisted until day 50 after diagnosis; fecal samples began to test negative before or at approximately the time that respiratory specimens also began to test negative. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of fecal and respiratory specimens from patients with COVID-19 in quarantine in Korea, we found that the gastrointestinal tract could be a route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 even in patients with asymptomatic or mild disease, with no gastrointestinal symptoms. The viral load of the respiratory specimens appears be related to shedding of the virus into feces in this group of patients.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Fecal Samples From Patients With Asymptomatic and Mild COVID-19 in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has markedly affected the health care of patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but no systematic study to corroborate this effect has been undertaken. In addition, the survival outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) have not been well established. We pooled evidence from all available studies and did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and compare mortality outcomes between LMICs and high-income countries (HICs). We searched MEDLINE and the University of Michigan Library according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines from December 1, 2019, to July 15, 2021, for case-control studies, cohort studies, and brief reports that discussed mortality ratios and survival outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received IMV. We excluded studies and case reports without comparison groups, narrative reviews, and preprints. A random-effects estimate of the arcsine square root transformation (PAS) of each outcome was generated with the DerSimonian-Laird method. Seven eligible studies, consisting of 243,835 patients with COVID-19, were included. We identified a significantly higher mortality rate (i.e., a larger PAS) among the patients receiving IMV in LMICs (PAS, 0.754; 95% CI, 0.569-0.900; P<.001) compared to patients in HICs (PAS, 0.588; 95% CI, 0.263-0.876; P<.001). Considerable heterogeneity was present within the individual subgroups possibly because of the extent of the included studies, which had data from specific countries and states but not from individual hospitals or health care centers. Moreover, the sample population in each study was diverse. Meta-regression showed that a higher mortality rate among patients with COVID-19 who received IMV in both HICs (P<.001) and LMICs (P=.04) was associated with chronic pulmonary disease. Our study suggests that chronic pulmonary diseases and poor demographics lead to a worse prognosis among patients with COVID-19 who received IMV.

In response, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene carried out a series of unannounced Mystery Patient Drills to assess Emergency Departments (ED) ability to identify and safely respond to patients with communicable diseases of public health concern. METHODS: All 911-receiving hospitals participating in the NYC Hospital Preparedness Program were recruited to participate. Scenarios utilized an actor presenting to an ED describing symptoms and history consistent with measles or MERS-CoV. An exercise evaluation guide captured performance measures to analyze 1) compliance with key infection control measures; 2) association between screening interventions (e.g., travel history) and implementation of infection control measures; 3) times from patient entry to triage, donning a mask, and placement into isolation. Post-drill report narratives were reviewed to identify additional strengths and challenges. RESULTS: Among 50 eligible hospitals, 49 participated in 2 drills (N = 98) during December 2015CMay 2016. Three pilot drills were excluded from the analysis. The patient was masked and isolated in 78% of drills; 61% of hospitals completed this process in both drills. Masking and isolation was observed in a higher proportion of drills when travel history was obtained, compared with drills when travel history was not obtained (88% vs. 21%; P < 0.0001). The median time from patient entry to masking was 1 minute and 9 minutes to placement into isolation. Overall, 36% of staff practiced hand hygiene and 77% entered the isolation room wearing Personal Protective Equipment. Identified best practices include the use of triage questionnaires to identify high-risk patients and algorithms to guide masking and isolation procedures. CONCLUSION: ED staffs ability to identify potentially infectious patients and implement recommended control measures varied.

To our knowledge there are no published interventions addressing burnout among radiation oncology residents. We describe the implementation of a well-being curriculum, cocreated by a psychologist, a medical humanities professional, and radiation oncology attending and resident physicians. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiation oncology residents at our institution were surveyed to determine themes that induced burnout. A curriculum was developed, with monthly small group sessions focused on 1 identified topic. Sessions alternated between psychological tool-focused approaches and humanities exercises. These were led by a psychologist or medical humanities professional. Residents were given protected time to attend sessions during business hours. Participation was optional. Participants were assigned a random identifier, and the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI) was assessed at baseline and 3-month intervals. PFI trends were analyzed after 1 year. At the end of the year, a focus group was held to evaluate work satisfaction and self-reported interactions with patients and coworkers. This information was used to improve the curriculum. RESULTS: All 12 residents in the radiation oncology program participated in the curriculum. There was an equal number of residents of postgraduate years 2 through 5. Six of the participants were female. Of the participants, 11 completed the PFI. At baseline, 80% of residents met criteria for burnout. This decreased to 67%, 50%, and 33% at 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively.

Hydrogels are compelling materials because they are soft, chemically tunable, biocompatible, and ionically conductive. Hydrogels have been used as components of skin mountable sensors, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes, and show promise in emerging devices as stretchable, transparent electrodes. Ultimately, these types of devices interface the hydrogel with rigid metallic electrodes to connect with electronic circuitry. Here, we show it is possible to interface hydrogel with liquid metal (eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn) electrodes to create completely soft and deformable electrodes that provide low resistance traces through the gel without altering its mechanical properties. As a case study, we created and tested electrodes for ECG monitoring. ECG electrodes require low impedance at biomedically relevant frequencies (1-50 Hz). Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that capacitive effects at the hydrogel-EGaIn interface dominate the impedance at these low frequencies, yet can be reduced by interfacing the metal with acidic or basic hydrogels that remove the native oxide skin from the metal. Increasing the ionic strength of the hydrogel also helps in lowering the impedance of the metal-hydrogel electrodes. The resulting devices have signal-to-noise ratios that exceed commercial ECG electrodes. The softness of these hydrogels can be modified without compromising the electrical properties to create truly soft electrodes. Interfacing liquid metal conductors with hydrogels represents a potential strategy of creating soft electrodes for various bioelectronic applications, e-skins, and next-generation soft robotics.","output":"Soft electrodes combining hydrogel and liquid metal."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been critical in efforts to control its spread.

One major disadvantage of that approach is the possibility of error due to inaccuracy of the gold standard, which is especially problematic for evaluating testing in a real-world surveillance context. We used an alternative approach known as Bayesian latent class modeling (BLCM), which circumvents the need to designate a gold standard by simultaneously estimating the accuracy of multiple tests. We applied this technique to a collection of 1,716 tests of three types applied to 853 individuals on a university campus during a one-week period in October 2020. We found that reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of saliva samples performed at a campus facility had higher sensitivity (median: 0.923; 95% credible interval: 0.732-0.996) than RT-PCR testing of nasal samples performed at a commercial facility (median: 0.859; 95% CrI: 0.547-0.994).

DESIGN A pilot, time-series study. SETTING Neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS Infants with severe BPD who required MV. INTERVENTIONS MV with helium-oxygen and air-oxygen mixtures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Respiratory parameters, acid-base balance, oxygenation and vital signs were recorded at five time points: initially during MV with air-oxygen, after 15 and 60 min of helium-oxygen MV, and 15 and 60 min after return to air-oxygen MV. RESULTS 15 infants with BPD were enrolled. Helium-oxygen MV was well tolerated and was associated with a statistically significant increase in tidal volume, dynamic compliance and peak expiratory flow rate. An improvement in oxygenation and a decrease in fraction of inspired oxygen was also observed. During helium-oxygen MV there was a significant decrease in the oxygenation index and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference. The PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio increased significantly during helium-oxygen ventilation. A decrease in PaCO2 and an increase in pH were also observed during helium-oxygen administration, however this was not statistically significant. After ventilation with helium-oxygen was discontinued, the infants' respiratory function and oxygenation deteriorated and supplemental oxygen requirements increased accordingly. CONCLUSIONS Helium-oxygen MV is safe and resulted in improvement of respiratory function and oxygenation in infants with severe BPD requiring MV.","output":"Heliox for mechanically ventilated newborns with bronchopulmonary dysplasia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims The study aims to examine the severity of anxiety in primary and secondary doctors in the UK during first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Method An online General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) survey was distributed during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020) to doctors in primary and secondary care in the UK. Seven closed-ended questions were included in the questionnaire. Respondents were to indicate how frequently they experienced specific issues in the previous fortnight: Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge;being unable to stop or control worrying;worrying too much generally;trouble relaxing;being so restless that it's hard to sit still;becoming easily annoyed or irritable, feeling afraid of something awful happening. Participants were required to tick one of four choices for each of the seven parameters - not at all (0), several days (1), more than half the days (2) and nearly every day (3). A person with minimal or no anxiety will score less than 5. The survey was anonymous and circulated in professional online doctors' forums. Participation was voluntary and no incentives were given. Result 273 completed surveys were received;120 doctors were in primary care and 153 were in secondary care. Average GAD7 score was 6.4 in primary care and 7.9 in secondary care. 57% of primary care doctors and 66% of secondary care doctors reported score of 5 or more, representing at least mild anxiety symptoms. 22% doctors in primary care and 31% doctors in secondary care reported GAD7 score of 10 or more, indicating moderate to severe anxiety. One in ten doctors in both primary and secondary care reported severe anxiety due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion The finding of more anxiety in secondary care doctors might be because general practitioners could resort early in the pandemic to remote consultations along with inadequacy of resources, greater exposure to suffering/deaths of patients and colleagues in hospital and perceived risk of catching COVID-19 infection. Results are limited due to relatively low numbers and it would be useful to replicate this study on a larger scale. Doctors are less likely to acknowledge their mental health difficulties due to stigma associated with mental health. Many employers have psychological support systems in place for their staff, but it is questionable if affected individuals are willing to receive this support. This paper;therefore, calls for creating open anonymous platforms for professionals to get access to appropriate support to address their anxiety.","output":"Anxiety levels during COVID 19 pandemic in primary and secondary doctors in UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 has been a focus during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we analyzed the distribution and character of emerging mutations in a data set comprising more than 95,000 virus genomes covering eight major SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the GISAID database, including genotypes arising during COVID-19 therapy. Globally, the C>U transitions and G>U transversions were the most represented mutations, accounting for the majority of single-nucleotide variations. Mutational spectra were not influenced by the time the virus had been circulating in its host or medical treatment. At the amino acid level, we observed about a 2-fold excess of substitutions in favor of hydrophobic amino acids over the reverse. However, most mutations constituting variants of interests of the S-protein (spike) lead to hydrophilic amino acids, counteracting the global trend. The C>U and G>U substitutions altered codons towards increased amino acid hydrophobicity values in more than 80% of cases. The bias is explained by the existing differences in the codon composition for amino acids bearing contrasting biochemical properties. Mutation asymmetries apparently influence the biochemical features of SARS CoV-2 proteins, which may impact protein-protein interactions, fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and virion assembly.","output":"Mutational Asymmetries in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome May Lead to Increased Hydrophobicity of Virus Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The study's aim was to analyze the capacity of human valve interstitial cells (VICs) to participate in aortic valve angiogenesis. Approach and Results: VICs were isolated from human aortic valves obtained after surgery for calcific aortic valve disease and from normal aortic valves unsuitable for grafting (control VICs). We examined VIC in vitro and in vivo potential to differentiate in endothelial and perivascular lineages. VIC paracrine effect was also examined on human endothelial colony-forming cells. A pathological VIC (VICp) mesenchymal-like phenotype was confirmed by CD90+/CD73+/CD44+ expression and multipotent-like differentiation ability. When VICp were cocultured with endothelial colony-forming cells, they formed microvessels by differentiating into perivascular cells both in vivo and in vitro. VICp and control VIC conditioned media were compared using serial ELISA regarding quantification of endothelial and angiogenic factors. Higher expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-A was observed at the protein level in VICp-conditioned media and confirmed at the mRNA level in VICp compared with control VIC. Conditioned media from VICp induced in vitro a significant increase in endothelial colony-forming cell proliferation, migration, and sprouting compared with conditioned media from control VIC. These effects were inhibited by blocking VEGF-A with blocking antibody or siRNA approach, confirming VICp involvement in angiogenesis by a VEGF-A dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS We provide here the first proof of an angiogenic potential of human VICs isolated from patients with calcific aortic valve disease. These results point to a novel function of VICp in valve vascularization during calcific aortic valve disease, with a perivascular differentiation ability and a VEGF-A paracrine effect. Targeting perivascular differentiation and VEGF-A to slow calcific aortic valve disease progression warrants further investigation.","output":"Human Aortic Valve Interstitial Cells Display Proangiogenic Properties During Calcific Aortic Valve Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The goal of this article is to provide a thorough literature review of available noninvasive and alternative treatment options for chronic low back pain.

RESULTS Relevant current and past references were reviewed and presented to reflect the efficacy of each therapy and related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS There are a wide variety of noninvasive and alternative therapies for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Those with the strongest evidence in the literature for good efficacy and outcomes include exercise therapy with supervised physical therapy, multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation, and acupuncture. Therapies with fair evidence or moderately supported by literature include yoga, back schools, thermal modalities, acupressure, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Those therapies with poor evidence or little to no literature support include manipulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, low-level laser therapy, reflexology, biofeedback, progressive relaxation, hypnosis, and aromatherapy.

Identifying the decisive factors for disease outcomes and progression is crucial to elucidate the macrophages-tuberculosis interaction and provide insights into therapeutic strategies. To achieve this goal, we first model the disease progression as a dynamical shift among different disease outcomes, which are characterized by various steady states of bacterial concentration. The causal mechanisms of steady-state transitions can be the occurrence of transcritical and saddle-node bifurcations, which are induced by slowly changing parameters. Transcritical bifurcation, occurring when the basic reproduction number equals to one, determines whether the infection clears or spreads. Saddle-node bifurcation is the key mechanism to create and destroy steady states. Based on these two steady-state transition mechanisms, we carry out two sample-based sensitivity analyses on transcritical bifurcation conditions and saddle-node bifurcation conditions. The sensitivity analysis results suggest that the macrophage apoptosis rate is the most significant factor affecting the transition in disease outcomes. This result agrees with the discovery that the programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays a unique role in the complex microorganism-host interplay. Sensitivity analysis narrows down the parameters of interest, but cannot answer how these parameters influence the model outcomes. To do this, we employ bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation to unfold various disease outcomes induced by the variation of macrophage apoptosis rate. Our findings support the hypothesis that the regulation mechanism of macrophage apoptosis affects the host immunity against tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis virulence. Moreover, our mathematical results suggest that new treatments and/or vaccines that regulate macrophage apoptosis in combination with weakening bacillary viability and/or promoting adaptive immunity could have therapeutic value.

The countrys economy, landscape of neurology practice, and disease burden are hypothesized to correlate with scientific output. This study aimed to objectively measure the impact of published studies on primary brain tumors in SEA and to assess for correlation with socioeconomic determinants and burden of disease. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases for relevant articles from SEA on primary CNS tumor until July 31, 2020. Bibliometric indices were reported and subjected to correlational analysis with population size, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, percentage (%) GDP for research and development (R&D), total number of neurologists, disease incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years. RESULTS: A total of 549 articles were included, consisting primarily of case reports (n=187, 34.06%) and discussed gliomas (n=195, 35.52%). Singapore published the most number of the articles (n=246, 44.8%). Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between %GDP for R&D and total publication. Additionally, negative relationships were noted between burden of disease and total neurologist with most bibliometric indices. However, GDP per capita was not correlated with measures for research productivity. CONCLUSION: The low impact of scientific output on primary CNS tumors in SEA does not address the growing epidemiology and burden of this disease. An increase in the GDP growth and financial and manpower investment to R&D may significantly improve research productivity in SEA.","output":"Primary Brain Tumor Research Productivity in Southeast Asia and Its Association With Socioeconomic Determinants and Burden of Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious bacterial infection of the endocardium and/or heart valves that carries considerable morbidity and mortality. Often presenting with very non-specific symptoms, this disease presents many challenges to the emergency medicine practitioner. A 47-year-old male with no pertinent medical history presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath. He stated that his symptoms had been persistent for the last three weeks and were associated with malaise and fatigue. CT of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast revealed a 7-cm hypodensity of the spleen concerning for abscess versus infarct. He denied any trauma or IV drug use. Follow-up ultrasound was ordered, which characterized the hypodensity as a splenic abscess. An echocardiogram was recommended for possible IE, and cardiology was consulted. The transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on hospital day 2, which showed minimal mitral valve thickening with mild mitral regurgitation. The interventional radiology (IR) service was consulted for the splenic abscess in order to perform CT-guided drainage. An IR drain was successfully placed on hospital day 3. On the same day, blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. On hospital day 5, that patient was transferred to the ICU for possible empyema formation with signs of respiratory distress. The patient underwent CT of the chest that showed the development of a left-sided effusion. The patient had also been persistently tachycardic and febrile, with high leukocytosis since admission and worsening respiratory status. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was scheduled but put on hold due to worsening respiratory status. Repeat TEE was scheduled five days later, which showed mitral regurgitation and increased size of the vegetation despite antibiotic therapy. Two days later, he was scheduled for mitral valve repair. When reviewing our case, the patient had both common and uncommon aspects of splenic abscess or IE. First, despite having respiratory symptoms for two weeks, the primary reason he came to the hospital was due to the new onset of fevers. He was febrile, tachycardic, and with significant leukocytosis. He continued to have fevers despite antibiotic therapy and IR drainage of the abscess. With no history of IV drug use history, negative transthoracic echocardiography, lack of immunocompromising condition, and blood cultures with gram-negative rods, IE became less likely of a diagnosis. Establishing the diagnosis of IE proved to be exceptionally complicated, especially in the setting of a COVID-19 pandemic. The most notable challenge was having a high index of suspicion despite any risk factors. The patient was a previously healthy 47-year-old male with no medical problems. IE continues to be a clinical challenge for physicians, especially in the emergency department, due to the lack of diagnostic criteria such as positive blood cultures or vegetations visualized on echocardiographic studies. IE has a wide gamut of presentations with different levels of acuity. Diagnosis is more straightforward when patients present with obvious risk factors, but, in many cases, such as this one, those risk factors may be absent. A high index of suspicion is required, especially in patients with additional findings such as splenic abscess, embolic phenomenon, focal neurologic deficit, mycotic aneurysm, decompensated heart failure, new murmurs, or pleural effusions.","output":"A Clinical Challenge in the Emergency Department: A Case of Klebsiella Infective Endocarditis Presenting With Splenic Abscess"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is an essential public health strategy to control the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

We sought to identify alterations to established conventional evidence-based management of acute severe ulcerative colitis during the early COVID-19 pandemic, the effect on outcomes, and any associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: The PROTECT-ASUC study was a multicentre, observational, case-control study in 60 acute secondary care hospitals throughout the UK. We included adults (18 years) with either ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease unclassified, who presented with acute severe ulcerative colitis and fulfilled the Truelove and Witts criteria. Cases and controls were identified as either admitted or managed in emergency ambulatory care settings between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic period cohort), or between Jan 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019 (historical control cohort), respectively. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis receiving rescue therapy (including primary induction) or colectomy. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04411784. FINDINGS: We included 782 patients (398 in the pandemic period cohort and 384 in the historical control cohort) who met the Truelove and Witts criteria for acute severe ulcerative colitis. The proportion of patients receiving rescue therapy (including primary induction) or surgery was higher during the pandemic period than in the historical period (217 [55%] of 393 patients vs 159 [42%] of 380 patients; p=000024) and the time to rescue therapy was shorter in the pandemic cohort than in the historical cohort (p=00026). This difference was driven by a greater use of rescue and primary induction therapies with biologicals, ciclosporin, or tofacitinib in the COVID-19 pandemic period cohort than in the historical control period cohort (177 [46%] of 387 patients in the COVID-19 cohort vs 134 [36%] of 373 patients in the historical cohort; p=00064). During the pandemic, more patients received ambulatory (outpatient) intravenous steroids (51 [13%] of 385 patients vs 19 [5%] of 360 patients; p=000023). Fewer patients received thiopurines (29 [7%] of 398 patients vs 46 [12%] of 384; p=0029) and 5-aminosalicylic acids (67 [17%] of 398 patients vs 98 [26%] of 384; p=00037) during the pandemic than in the historical control period. Colectomy rates were similar between the pandemic and historical control groups (64 [16%] of 389 vs 50 [13%] of 375; p=026); however, laparoscopic surgery was less frequently performed during the pandemic period (34 [53%] of 64] vs 38 [76%] of 50; p=0018). Five (2%) of 253 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospital treatment. Two (2%) of 103 patients re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the 3-month follow-up were positive 5 days and 12 days, respectively, after discharge from index admission. Both recovered without serious outcomes. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic altered practice patterns of gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons in the management of acute severe ulcerative colitis but was associated with similar outcomes to a historical cohort. Despite continued use of high-dose corticosteroids and biologicals, the incidence of COVID-19 within 3 months was low and not associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, OpenGrey, and the annual Dengue Bulletin were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the unmodified clinical criteria. Two reviewers (NR/SL) independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias using a modified QUADAS-2. Additional records were found by citation network analysis. A meta-analysis was done using a bivariate mixed-effects regression model. Studies that modified criteria were analysed separately. This systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020165998). We identified 11 and 12 datasets assessing the 1997 and 2009 definition, respectively, and 6 using modified criteria.

Socio-demographic, various potential risk factors, including pre-existing morbidities, vaccination status, and severity of acute COVID-19 illness, information on acute illness for management and a spectrum of PCS were collected between June 16 to July 28, 2021. Each participant was contacted telephonically before sending the survey link. PCS were presented as relative frequency; chi-square test, odds ratio, including adjusted, were calculated to rule out association between PCS and potential predictors. ResultsA total of 773 of 1801 COVID recovered participants responded to the link reaching a participation rate of 42{middle dot}9%, with a median age of 34 years (IQR 27 to 44). Male respondents were 56{middle dot}4%. Around 33{middle dot}2% of them had PCS at four or more weeks, affecting almost all body organ systems. The most prevalent PCS were fatigue (79{middle dot}3%), pain in the joins (33{middle dot}4%), muscle (29{middle dot}9%), hair loss (28{middle dot}0%), headache (27{middle dot}2%), breathlessness (25{middle dot}3%), sleep disturbance (25{middle dot}3%) and cough (24{middle dot}9%). The prevalence of PCS was reduced to 12{middle dot}8% at 12 weeks after positive test. Factor such as female gender, older age, oxygen supplementation during the acute illness, working in healthcare care facilities, the severity of acute illness, and pre-existing co-morbid were risk factors for PCS. Further, vaccination (second dose) reduced the odds of developing PCS by 45% compared to unvaccinated participants (aOR 0{middle dot}65; 95%CI 0{middle dot}45-0{middle dot}96). Finally, 8{middle dot}3% of participants rated their overall health status was either poor or very poor following COVID-19 illness. ConclusionsThe PCS involves almost all organ systems, regardless of the severity of acute COVID-19 illness. Two doses of vaccine help to reduce development of PCS. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAlthough the evidence is mounting in prolonged COVID-19 symptoms among COVID-19 survivors, to date, the full range of such post-COVID-19 symptoms (PCS) is not yet fully understood. There is a lack of studies that assessed PCS comprehensively among persons who have recovered from the COVID-19illness. For example, limited data are available on psychosocial, behavioral, and oral manifestations related to PCS. Further, there is a paucity of studies that included a wide range of determinants of PCS and the association of vaccination with the development of PCS across the world. Our study is the first such study conducted among COVID-19 recovered persons who with a majority of them employed in a tertiary health care institute of north India. Added value of this studyOur study, for the first time, investigated a wide range of post-COVID-19 manifestations among COVID-19 recovered persons in organ-specific and psychosocial behavioral aspects, making this the largest categorization of PCS currently (in total 16). The study included telephonic calls to each eligible candidate which helped in ensuring the COVID-19 status at the time of the study. Since the participants either were employees in the hospital or their dependents that enhance the accuracy of reporting PCS. The most prevalent symptom was unspecific PCS (85.6%), e.g., fatigue, followed by musculoskeletal manifestations (49{middle dot}8%), Ear, Nose and Throat symptoms (47{middle dot}5%), neurological (47{middle dot}0%), cardio-respiratory (42{middle dot}4%, gastrointestinal (36{middle dot}2%), ocular symptoms (31{middle dot}9%), dermatological symptoms (31{middle dot}5%), and cardio-vascular (24{middle dot}5%) symptoms, and mental health symptoms (23{middle dot}7%). The rest of the organ specific symptoms were observed in less than 20% of the respondents. Older age, female gender, pre-existing co-morbid, oxygen supplementation during acute illness, the severity of illness, working in health care institutions were associated with PCS. Vaccination after the second dose was protective against PCS compared to non-vaccinated participants. Further, our study also reported a rating of the overall health status among COVID survivors, whereby around 8.3% of them reported being a poor or very poor health. Implications of all the available evidencePCS affects a multi-organ organ system, irrespective of the severity of acute-phase COVID-19 illness and hospitalization. Such persistent COVID-19 symptoms, compounded by its heterogeneity among COVID survivors can pose a substantial burden to the affected individuals and their families and additional challenges for healthcare delivery and public health service. The current study shows that one in three individuals experience persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Since the COVID pandemic is still ongoing across the world, therefore, the number of people experiencing PCS is likely to be increased substantially further. An integrated PCS care strategy, but not limited to organ-specific healthcare disciplines, others such as psychosocial support, including counseling and education, rehabilitation, community-based rehabilitation programs will be required for management. Prioritization of PCS care to elder and co-morbid patients should be recommended. Expediting the vaccination drive will be helpful to reduce the development of persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Research, collaborative and multidisciplinary, is required to understand the underlying pathophysiology mechanism for PCS.","output":"Assessment of Post COVID-19 Health Problems and its Determinants in North India: A descriptive cross section study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel protocols were developed to accurately quantify reduced (GSH), oxidized (GSSG) and total (tGSH) glutathione in biological samples using molecular speciated isotope dilution mass spectrometry (SIDMS).

Clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been described. However, risk factors leading to in-hospital deterioration and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients with severe disease have not been well identified. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, 1190 adult inpatients (&#8805; 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and determined outcomes (discharged or died) were included from Wuhan Infectious Disease Hospital from December 29, 2019 to February 28, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 2, 2020. Clinical data including characteristics, laboratory and imaging information as well as treatments were extracted from electronic medical records and compared. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the potential predictors associated with in-hospital deterioration and death. RESULTS: 1190 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Their median age was 57 years (interquartile range 47-67 years). Two hundred and sixty-one patients (22%) developed a severe illness after admission. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that higher SOFA score (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22-1.43, per score increase, p < 0.001 for deterioration and OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11-1.53, per score increase, p = 0.001 for death), lymphocytopenia (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.13-2.89 p = 0.013 for deterioration; OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.26-15.87, p = 0.021 for death) on admission were independent risk factors for in-hospital deterioration from not severe to severe disease and for death in severe patients. On admission D-dimer greater than 1 g/L (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.19-9.04, p = 0.021), leukocytopenia (OR 5.10, 95% CI 1.25-20.78), thrombocytopenia (OR 8.37, 95% CI 2.04-34.44) and history of diabetes (OR 11.16, 95% CI 1.87-66.57, p = 0.008) were also associated with higher risks of in-hospital death in severe COVID-19 patients. Shorter time interval from illness onset to non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the survivors with severe disease was observed compared with non-survivors (10.5 days, IQR 9.25-11.0 vs. 16.0 days, IQR 11.0-19.0 days, p = 0.030). Treatment with glucocorticoids increased the risk of progression from not severe to severe disease (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.39-6.01, p < 0.001). Administration of antiviral drugs especially oseltamivir or ganciclovir is associated with a decreased risk of death in severe patients (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.64, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High SOFA score and lymphocytopenia on admission could predict that not severe patients would develop severe disease in-hospital. On admission elevated D-dimer, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and diabetes were independent risk factors of in-hospital death in severe patients with COVID-19. Administration of oseltamivir or ganciclovir might be beneficial for reducing mortality in severe patients.","output":"Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a large cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this study was to analyse neurological symptoms during a Covid-19 infection and determine the pattern of symptoms by comparing outpatients with inpatients. A further goal was to identify possible predictors, such as pre-existing conditions and neurological symptoms. We recorded the clinical data of 40 inpatients and 42 outpatients in this retrospective, cross sectional study. Of them, 68 patients (83%), evenly distributed between the two groups, suffered from neurological symptoms. We identified the onset of neurological symptoms and the related time ranges in 41 patients (36 outpatients and 5 inpatients). Of these, 63.4% reported neurological symptoms on the first or second day of illness. 49 patients (72%) showed combinations of at least two to a maximum of seven different neurological symptoms. A more severe course of disease was correlated with age and male sex, but age was not identified as a predictor for the occurrence of neurological symptoms. Women suffered from central and neuromuscular symptoms more often than men (p = 0,004). The most common symptoms were fatigue (54%), headache (31%), loss of taste (31%), and loss of smell (27%). Pre-existing dementia was associated with increased lethality; similarly, pre-existing stroke was associated with a more severe course of Covid-19 infection. Hallucinations and confusion were related to an increased likelihood of death.

With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is an important cause of death. Therefore, treatment of the cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome. If it is possible to block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.

Given the relatively novelty of the disease, risk factors of mortality and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients remain to be elucidated OBJECTIVE: To define independent risk factors predictive fo mortality, need for ICU care, and mechanical ventilation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Large tertiary-care, academic university hospital PATIENTS: Adults admitted with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1-April 15, 2020 METHODS: Baseline clinical characteristics and admission laboratory variables were retrospectively collected. Patients were grouped based on mortality, need for ICU care, and mechanical ventilation. Prevalence of clinical co-morbidities and laboratory abnormalities were compared between groups using descriptive statistics. Univariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of mortality, ICU care and mechanical ventilation. Predictors significant at p0.10 were included in multivariate analysis. RESULTS 560 patients were included in the analysis. Age and myocardial injury were only independent predictors of mortality, in patients with/without baseline co-morbidities. BMI, elevated ferritin, elevated d-dimer, and elevated procalcitonin predicted need for ICU care, and these along with vascular disease at baseline predicted need for mechanical ventilation. LIMITATIONS All data were not available on each patient. Data on admission symptoms, vital signs, or imaging parameters were not collected. CONCLUSION Age and myocardial injury are the strongest independent predictors of mortality among patients admitted with COVID-19.

Methods The N orth A merican C OVID-19 STE MI (NACMI) registry is a prospective, investigator initiated, multi-center, observational registry of hospitalized STEMI patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection in North America. We compared trends in clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of patients treated in the first year of the pandemic (1/2020 to 12/2020) versus those treated in the second year (1/2021 to 12/2021). Results A total of 586 COVID positive (+) patients with STEMI were included in the present analysis; 227 treated in Y2020 and 359 treated in Y2021. Patients characteristics changed over time.

However, the majority eventually develop resistance with a median PFS of 8C12 months. The pattern of failure studies showed disease relapse at the original sites of the disease-harbouring resistant tumour cells. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is designed as a phase II randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of local consolidative radiation therapy (LCRT) in addition to TKI in upfront oligometastatic NSCLC. Patients will be screened at presentation for oligometastases (5 sites) and will start on TKI after confirmation of EGFR or ALK mutation status. After initial TKI for 2C4 months, eligible patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio with stratification of oligometastatic sites (1C3 vs 4C5), performance status of 0C1 versus 2 and brain metastases. The standard arm will continue to receive TKI, and the intervention arm will receive TKI plus LCRT. Stereotactic body radiation therapy will be delivered to all the oligometastatic sites. The primary end point is PFS, and secondary end points are overall survival, local control of oligometastatic sites, toxicity and patient-reported outcomes. The sample size calculation took a median PFS of 10 months in the standard arm. To detect an absolute improvement of 7 months in the interventional arm, with a one-sided alpha of 5% and 80% power, a total of 106 patients will be accrued over a period of 48 months.

In this study we have constructed a series of full length or truncated mutants of the G2 glycoprotein of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae, and investigated their transport properties. The results indicate that the hydrophobic domain preceding the G2 glycoprotein can function as a translocational signal peptide, and that the hydrophobic domain near the C-terminus serves as a membrane anchor. A G2 glycoprotein construct with an extra hydrophobic sequence derived from the N-terminal NSM region was stably retained in the ER, and was unable to be transported to the Golgi complex. The full-length G2 glycoprotein, when expressed on its own, was transported out of the ER and expressed on the cell surface, whereas the G1 and G2 proteins when expressed together are retained in the Golgi complex. A truncated anchor-minus form of the G2 glycoprotein was found to be secreted into the culture medium, but was retained in the Golgi complex when coexpressed with the G1 glycoprotein. These results indicate that the G2 membrane glycoprotein is a class I membrane protein which does not contain a signal sufficient for Golgi retention, and suggest that its Golgi localization is a result of association with the G1 glycoprotein.","output":"Golgi complex localization of the Punta Toro virus G2 protein requires its association with the G1 protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in severe COVID-19. We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza in order to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease. METHODS: Thirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 135 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was utilized to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was utilized to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI and age on disease severity. RESULTS: IL-18, IL-1?, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients while GM-CSF, IFN-?3, IFN-&#955;1, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group.

However, the impact on sociodemographic characteristics of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to describe the changes in sociodemographic characteristics of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and to compare the transmission risk factors of COVID-19 before and during lockdown in France. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted in a University Hospital in Paris, France. Data from patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Infectious Diseases Department between February 26 and May 11, 2020 were collected. The study population was divided into 2 groups: group A of patients infected before lockdown, and group B of patients infected during lockdown, considering a maximum incubation period of 14 days. Sociodemographic characteristics and transmission risk factors were compared between the 2 groups using Students t-test for continuous variables and Chi-2 test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-three patients were included in the study, 305 (79.6%) in group A and 78 (20.4%) in group B. Patients in group A were significantly younger (60.0 versus (vs) 66.5 years (p = 0.03)). The professionally active population was larger in group A (44.3% vs 24.4%).

Their parents and siblings could also participate to estimate familial transmission and the congruence between serological statuses. A questionnaire was completed for each participant to identify symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in the previous months. Blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G using ELISA. The final population included 112 children, 24 siblings of these children, and 36 adults.

The aim of this study is to report a new technical approach to the rehabilitation of a complex oronasal defect by means of a zygoma-implant-supported full-arch dental prosthesis combined with a nasal epithesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS The patient presented with a subtotal bilateral maxillectomy and total rhinectomy defect because of a squamous cell carcinoma of the nose. No reconstructive surgery was performed because of the high risk of recurrence; moreover, the patient refused any secondary procedure. After surgery, the patient presented a wide palatal defect associated to the absence of the nasal pyramid. Zygoma-retained prostheses are well documented, and they offer good anchorage in rehabilitating wide defects after oncological surgery and a good chance for patients to improve their quality of life. We hereby describe two prosthetic devices rehabilitating two iatrogenic defects by means of a single intraoral implant-supported bar extending throughout the oronasal communication, thus offering nasal epithesis anchorage. RESULTS At 1-year follow-up after functional prosthetic loading, no implant failure has been reported. Clinical and radiological follow-up showed no sign of nasal infection or peri-implantitis. The patient reported a sensitive improvement of his quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous oral and nasal rehabilitation of complex oronasal defects with zygoma-implant-supported dental prosthesis and nasal epithesis represents a reliable surgical technique.

Recommendations on the management of acute appendicitis have been based on expert opinion, but very little evidence is available. This study addressed that dearth with a snapshot of worldwide approaches to appendicitis. METHODS: The Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe designed an online survey to assess the current attitude of surgeons globally regarding the management of patients with acute appendicitis during the pandemic. Questions were divided into baseline information, hospital organization and screening, personal protective equipment, management and surgical approach, and patient presentation before versus during the pandemic. RESULTS: Of 744 answers, 709 (from 66 countries) were complete and were included in the analysis. Most hospitals were treating both patients with and those without COVID. There was variation in screening indications and modality used, with chest X-ray plus molecular testing (PCR) being the commonest (198 per cent). Conservative management of complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis was used by 66 and 24 per cent respectively before, but 237 and 53 per cent, during the pandemic (both P < 0001). One-third changed their approach from laparoscopic to open surgery owing to the popular (but evidence-lacking) advice from expert groups during the initial phase of the pandemic. No agreement on how to filter surgical smoke plume during laparoscopy was identified. There was an overall reduction in the number of patients admitted with appendicitis and one-third felt that patients who did present had more severe appendicitis than they usually observe. CONCLUSION: Conservative management of mild appendicitis has been possible during the pandemic.

Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most have used early-stage data and focused on Chinese cases. Methods: We first built models to predict daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020. Based on these models, we built models to predict the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). We also built models to predict the epidemic trend in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading. Findings: The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked on February 22, 2020, in China and will peak on May 22, 2020, across the world. It will be basically under control in early April 2020 in China and end-August 2020 across the world.

Methods: For this prospective observational pilot study, medical students and neonatal nursing staff were recruited on a voluntary basis. Pre- and post-training knowledge was assessed using a 20-question questionnaire. Following the educational intervention, participants further answered a six-item questionnaire on their perception of telesimulation.

However, the findings of typical economic evaluations (e.g., based on clinical trials) are rarely sufficient to inform decisions about how health service organizations and policymakers should finance investments in EBPs. This paper describes how economic evaluations can be translated into policy and practice through complementary research on financing strategies that support EBP implementation and sustainment. MAIN BODY: We provide an overview of EBP implementation financing, which outlines key financing and health service delivery system stakeholders and their points of decision-making. We then illustrate how economic evaluations have informed decisions about EBP implementation and sustainment with three case examples: (1) use of Pay-for-Success financing to implement multisystemic therapy in underserved areas of Colorado, USA, based in part on the strength of evidence from economic evaluations; (2) an alternative payment model to sustain evidence-based oncology care, developed by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services through simulations of economic impact; and (3) use of a recently developed fiscal mapping process to collaboratively match financing strategies and needs during a pragmatic clinical trial for a newly adapted family support intervention for opioid use disorder. CONCLUSIONS: EBP financing strategies can help overcome cost-related barriers to implementing and sustaining EBPs by translating economic evaluation results into policy and practice. We present a research agenda to advance understanding of financing strategies in five key areas raised by our case examples: (1) maximize the relevance of economic evaluations for real-world EBP implementation; (2) study ongoing changes in financing systems as part of economic evaluations; (3) identify the conditions under which a given financing strategy is most beneficial; (4) explore the use and impacts of financing strategies across pre-implementation, active implementation, and sustainment phases; and (5) advance research efforts through strong partnerships with stakeholder groups while attending to issues of power imbalance and transparency. Attention to these research areas will develop a robust body of scholarship around EBP financing strategies and, ultimately, enable greater public health impacts of EBPs.","output":"Translating economic evaluations into financing strategies for implementing evidence-based practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ending all forms of hunger by 2030, as set forward in the UN-Sustainable Development Goal 2 (UN-SDG2), is a daunting but essential task, given the limited timeline ahead and the negative global health and socio-economic impact of hunger.

Recently, plasma levels of galectin-9 (Gal-9), a {beta}-galactoside-binding lectin involved in immune regulation and viral immunopathogenesis, were reported to be elevated in the setting of severe COVID-19 disease. However, the impact of Gal-9 on SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunopathology remained to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Gal-9 treatment potently enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway epithelial cells (AECs), including primary AECs in air-liquid interface (ALI) culture. Gal-9-glycan interactions promote SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry into AECs in an ACE2-dependent manner, enhancing the binding affinity of the viral spike protein to ACE2. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Gal-9 and SARS-CoV-2 infection synergistically induce the expression of key pro-inflammatory programs in AECs including the IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, EIF2, and TNF signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that manipulation of Gal-9 should be explored as a therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. ImportanceCOVID-19 continues to have a major global health and economic impact. Identifying host molecular determinants that modulate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and pathology is a key step in discovering novel therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. Several recent studies have revealed that plasma concentrations of the human {beta}-galactoside-binding protein galectin-9 (Gal-9) are highly elevated in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we investigated the impact of Gal-9 on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis ex vivo in airway epithelial cells (AECs), the critical initial targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings reveal that Gal-9 potently enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication in AECs, interacting with glycans to enhance the binding between viral particles and entry receptors on the target cell surface. Moreover, we determined that Gal-9 accelerates and exacerbates several virus-induced pro-inflammatory programs in AECs that are established signature characteristics of COVID-19 disease and SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

It also describes the context of publicly funded blood transfusion in Canada and the withdrawal event that is the basis of this study. METHODS: Interviews with 45 experts from administration, medicine, blood supply, laboratory services and risk assessment took place using a multi-level sampling framework in the aftermath of the recall. These experts either directly dealt with the withdrawal or were involved in the management of the blood supply at the national level. Data from these interviews were coded in NVivo for analysis and interpretation. Analytically, data were interpreted to derive typifications to relate interview responses to risk management heuristics. RESULTS: While all those interviewed agreed on the importance of patient safety, differences in the ways in which the risk was contextualized and explicated were discerned. Risk was seen in terms of patient safety, liability or precaution. These different risk logics are illustrated by selected quotations. CONCLUSIONS: Expert assessments did not fully converge and it is possible that these different risk logics and discourses may affect the risk management process more generally, although not necessarily in a negative way. Patient safety is not to be compromised but management of blood risk in publicly funded systems may vary. We suggest ways of managing blood risk using formal and safety case approaches.","output":"Do expert assessments converge?

SUMMARY: In a health system based in Illinois and Wisconsin, pharmacy services are provided by a single, integrated department responsible for all aspects of pharmaceutical care within the organization. Hospital, retail, ambulatory care, and population health services are all managed under one leadership team. All pertinent ancillary services are also managed within the department, including informatics, supply chain, and drug policy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmacy services leadership has successfully managed volume and capacity challenges by redirecting resources to where they are needed. A disaster response framework based on Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance was put in place, and change management principles were used to rapidly operationalize change. Components of the nimble response have included quickly increasing capacity, thoughtful and timely communication to all team members, strategic decision making with available data, creating an agile pool of labor, and maintaining an efficient system supply chain. Well-being and resilience are emphasized alongside reflection on lessons learned. Some changes made in the urgent response to the pandemic are being considered for long-term implementation. CONCLUSION: Organizations have the potential to respond to almost any situation if they are integrated and teams work together to build flexibility.

DESIGN The study was a retrospective case-controlled study. PARTICIPANTS There were 163 patients with COVID-19 deemed candidates for CPAP on admission, including 58 who subsequently required CPAP. OUTCOME MEASURES On admission, we measured the proportion of patients meeting a composite 'negative' outcome of requiring CPAP, intubation or dying versus successful ward-based care. For those escalated to CPAP, 'negative' outcomes were intubation or death versus successful de-escalation of respiratory support. RESULTS Our results were stratified into tertiles, those with 'moderate' or 'severe' X-rays on admission had significantly higher odds of negative outcome versus 'mild' (odds ratio (OR) 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.121-4.803; p=0.023; and OR 3.600; 95% CI 1.681-7.708; p=0.001, respectively).

All the state-accredited universities in the following countries were included in the analysis: Romania, Denmark, Hungary and UK. These countries were chosen for the diversity in the state of their gender politics and in their overall quality of higher education.

There were no marked changes in mean levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, or loneliness between 2019 and 2020, or over the course of the Spring 2020 term. Students in both the 2019 and 2020 cohort who indicated psychosocial vulnerability at the initial assessment showed worse psychosocial functioning throughout the entire Spring term relative to other students. However, rates of distress increased faster in 2020 than in 2019 for these individuals. Across individuals, homogeneity of variance tests and multi-level models revealed significant heterogeneity, suggesting the need to examine not just means but the variations in individuals' experiences. Thematic analysis of interviews characterizes these varied experiences, describing the contexts for students' challenges and strategies. This analysis highlights the interweaving of psychosocial and academic distress: Challenges such as isolation from peers, lack of interactivity with instructors, and difficulty adjusting to family needs had both an emotional and academic toll. Strategies for adjusting to this new context included initiating remote study and hangout sessions with peers, as well as self-learning. In these and other strategies, students used technologies in different ways and for different purposes than they had previously. Supporting qualitative insight about adaptive responses were quantitative findings that students who used more problem-focused forms of coping reported fewer mental health symptoms over the course of the pandemic, even though they perceived their stress as more severe. These findings underline the need for interventions oriented towards problem-focused coping and suggest opportunities for peer role modeling.

We evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 SAR in Massachusetts schools during 2020-21 and factors associated with transmission risk. Methods: In a convenience sample of 25 Massachusetts public K-12 school districts, de-identified information about SARS-CoV-2 cases and their school-based contacts was reported using a standardized contact-tracing tool. Index cases were included if they were in school while infectious. SAR was defined as the proportion of in-school contacts acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and designated as possible or probable in-school transmission by school-based teams. We compared exposure-specific SAR using unadjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); p-values were calculated using Fishers exact tests. Results Eight districts (70 schools with >33,000 enrolled students) participated. There were 435 index cases and 1,771 school-based contacts (Table 1). Most contacts (1327/1771 [75%]) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and 39/1327 (2.9%) contacts tested positive. Of 39 positive contacts, 10 (25.6%) had clear out-of-school exposures and were deemed not in-school transmissions, so were excluded from further calculations. Twenty-nine (74.4%) contacts were deemed possible or probable in-school transmissions, resulting in an in-school SAR of 2.2%. Of the 29 in-school transmissions, 6 (20.7%) were staff-to-staff, 7 (24.1%) were staff-to-student, 3 (10.3%) were student-to-staff, and 13 (44.8%) were student-to-student; 6 (20.7%) occurred from index cases attending work/school while symptomatic. The unadjusted SAR (Table 2) was significantly higher if the index case was a staff member versus a student (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.06-4.49; p=0.030), if the index case was identified via in-school contact tracing versus via school-based asymptomatic testing (RR 8.44, 95% CI 1.98-36.06; p=0.001), if the exposure occurred at lunch versus elsewhere (RR 5.74, 95% CI 2.11-15.63; p<0.001; all lunch transmissions were staff-to-staff), and if both parties were unmasked versus both masked (RR 6.98, 95% CI 3.09-15.77; p<0.001). For students, SAR did not differ by grade level.

This work empirically demonstrates the extent to which young women in Nepal experience harassment from men in the marketplace and the various tactics they employ to lessen it. Furthermore, this research exposes the extent to which Nepali men admit to participating in verbal, physical, or visual harassment of women in various retailing and service settings. The article concludes with a discussion of theoretical, managerial, and societal implications and encourages public policy officials to treat street harassment as a criminal offense.","output":"Street harassment is marketplace discrimination: The impact of street harassment on young female consumers marketplace experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract By using three areas of well-being, psychological, physical, and social this study aims to explore the perceptions of consumers engaging in digital-physical platforms and communities during the UK COVID-19 lockdown and the impact such participation had on their well-being Ninety people were recruited via an online study, all were using online workouts, and self-selected to participate The use of virtual ethnography gave further insight into the functions of these platforms and their role in social connection Participants discussed the benefits to their mental health, the provision of structure to their day, the social connection it provided, and the alleviation of feelings of isolation The findings also demonstrate how numerous consumer groups in society could use digital-physical platforms as a potential way of connecting those who are unable to engage in face-to-face settings","output":"Web workouts and consumer well-being: The role of digital-physical activity during the UK COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unrelenting obesity pandemic in Middle Eastern (ME) adolescents living in Australia warrants culturally responsive and locally engineered interventions. Given the influence of parents on the lifestyle behaviours of adolescents, this qualitative study aimed to capture the opinions of ME parents on the barriers and enablers to sufficient physical activity and limiting screen time behaviours in adolescents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 ME parents (female) aged 35C59 years old, most of whom resided in lower socioeconomic areas (n = 19). A reflexive thematic analysis using the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour model was performed for coding. Parents voiced confidence in their knowledge of the importance of physical activity and limiting screen time but were less optimistic in their ability to enable change in behaviours, especially for older adolescents without outside support. Despite adolescents having the necessary skills to engage in a wide array of sports, the parents admitted deep fears regarding the safety of the social environment and restricted their childrens independent mobility. Gender differences were noted, with parents reporting older girls expressing disinterest in sports and having limited physical opportunities to participate in sports at school. It may be that a community-based participatory framework is needed to improve physical activity opportunities and to address specific physical, social, and cultural barriers.","output":"Enabling Better Physical Activity and Screen Time Behaviours for Adolescents from Middle Eastern Backgrounds: Semi-Structured Interviews with Parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 in China, and with the urge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been a huge effort of many research teams and governmental institutions worldwide to mitigate the current scenario.

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. Social distancing measures, public health action and the reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a continued very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. New cases of COVID-19 are currently being reported by by only some jurisdictions, albeit at relatively low rates. Although case numbers are low, new cases tend to still be a mix of overseas-acquired and locally-acquired infections. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of new cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years. One third of all cases in this age group have been associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, while the number of new cases each day remains relatively stable at the global level, some areas such as Brazil and India are showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have so far reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of true disease incidence.","output":"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 16 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEST 17 May 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study sought to identify individual-level determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).

STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020, in all 3139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent the speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without SIP orders. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to &#8804;10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% compared with the counties that did not implement SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. CONCLUSIONS: SIP orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US.

Mutations in the MECP2 gene were identified as causing Rett syndrome in 1999. Over the past 20 years there has been an abundance of preclinical research with some studies leading to human clinical trials. Despite this, few viable therapeutic options have emerged from this investment of effort. Reasons for this lack of success as they relate both to preclinical research and the clinical trial landscape are discussed. Considering what needs to be done to promote further success in the field, we take a positive and constructive approach and introduce the concept of clinical trial readiness and its necessary ingredients for Rett syndrome. These include: listening to the needs of families; support from advocacy groups; optimising use of existing clinic infrastructures and available natural history data; and, finally, the validation of existing outcome measures and/or the development and validation of new measures. We conclude by reiterating the need for a collaborative and coordinated approach amongst the many different stakeholder groups and the need to engage in new types of trial design which could be much more efficient, less costly and much less burdensome on families.

The effect of spironolactone on BP of patients at risk of developing HF is yet to be determined. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of spironolactone on the BP of patients at risk for HF and whether renin can predict spironolactone\`s effect. METHODS: HOMAGE (Heart OMics in Aging) was a prospective multicenter randomized open-label blinded Endpoint (PROBE) trial including 527 patients at risk for developing HF randomly assigned to either spironolactone (25-50mg/day) or usual care alone for a maximum of 9 months. Sitting BP was assessed at baseline, month 1 and 9 (or last visit). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), mixed effects models, and structural modelling equations were used. RESULTS: The median (percentile25-75) age was 73 (69-79) years, 26% were female, and >75% had history of hypertension. Overall, the baseline BP was 142/78 mmHg. Patients with higher BP were older, more likely to have diabetes and less likely to have coronary artery disease, had greater left ventricular mass (LVM), and left atrial volume (LAV). Compared with usual care, by last visit, spironolactone changed SBP by -10.3 (-13.0 to -7.5)mmHg and DBP by -3.2 (-4.8 to -1.7)mmHg (p < 0.001 for both). A higher proportion of patients on spironolactone had controlled BP < 130/80 mmHg (36 vs. 26%; p = 0.014). Lower baseline renin levels predicted a greater response to spironolactone (interactionp=0.041). CONCLUSION: Spironolactone had a clinically important BP-lowering effect.

We assay the expression of this gene in embryonic Atlantic salmon Salmo salar by whole-mount in situ hybridization. In line with earlier studies in other vertebrate species, we find conserved expression in the developing brain and sensory organs, including optic and olfactory primordia. However, we also find previously unreported domains of expression that suggest additional roles in axial and appendicular development, cardiovascular, intestinal, and sensory organogenesis.

While laboratory-based studies demonstrate persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, the likelihood of fomite-mediated transmission under real-life conditions is uncertain. MethodsUsing a quantitative risk assessment model, we simulated in a frozen food packaging facility 1) SARS-CoV-2 fomite-mediated infection risks following worker exposure to contaminated plastic packaging; and 2) reductions in these risks attributed to masking, handwashing, and vaccination. FindingsIn a representative facility with no specific interventions, SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to a susceptible worker from contact with contaminated packaging was 2{middle dot}8 x 10-3 per 1h-period (95%CI: 6{middle dot}9 x 10-6, 2{middle dot}4 x 10-2).

A complete lockdown deemed the entire population of the country to stay wherever they were residing at that point of time with no entry or exit movements being permitted thereafter. This unique situation betwixt a menacing health crisis rolled out a scenario uncustomary to the nation\`s citizens. The varied responses of the masses to the lockdown need to be captured in order to understand the difficulties and dilemmas faced by them. Hence, this qualitative analysis aimed to capture the immediate challenges and experiences faced by the working population during the first-ever declared nationwide lockdown. METHODOLOGY: After obtaining institutional ethical committee clearance, a qualitative study was conducted using grounded theory approach. Using purposive sampling, people representative of the working-class population in Kerala were selected from three districts of the state. Equal representation of males and females were maintained. In-depth interviews were conducted via telephone using an interview guide till data saturation was obtained. The audio recorded data were later transcribed verbatim and translated to English. The transcripts were then manually coded to identify the emerging themes and subthemes and conclusions were drawn after triangulation. RESULTS: The age of the study participants ranged from 32 to 71 years, they were occupied in different vocations and belonged to middle-class families across three districts of Kerala. All of them were aware and were mentally prepared for a national lockdown. They also made arrangements such as purchase of food, drinking water, medicines, etc., for home but also for office as well. Even though most of them were initially excited about the lockdown it was then followed by fear of contracting the disease, worries about loss of work and financial security. The study participants identified the advantages of lockdown as having more time for self & for family, use of the online/digital medium for routine activities and many also appreciated the support provided by the government in the form of food kits and loans. The lockdown was found to have increased the workload especially for women who had to manage not only family but also online work from home. CONCLUSION: The study was able to capture the different experiences and challenges faced by the middle-class working population. Even though they went through a cascade of initial excitement followed by fear of contracting the disease, it eventually turned into concerns of job and financial insecurities.

We analyzed the data for all 4,699 patients from SEH and the 27 confirmed COVID-19 cases among them to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases identified in the SEH. Methods: : Data were collected for patients who visited the fever outpatient clinic in the SEH between January 23 and April 30, 2020. We compared the characteristics of confirmed cases, including age, occupation, area, symptoms, laboratory results, and computed tomography (CT) scans, by month. Results: : By April 30, 4,699 patients had visited the fever outpatient clinic of the SEH;of those, 27 (0.57%) were confirmed COVID-19 cases. Among the confirmed domestic cases identified between January and February, four of five were from Wuhan, Hubei. Following the spread of the epidemic to other parts of the world, all confirmed cases identified in MarchCApril were cases of individuals who were returning from abroad, mainly Chinese students living abroad. Further, all cases were from outside Shanghai, and no local residents were diagnosed in the clinic. Symptoms, laboratory tests, and CT scans were consistent with previous literature reports of positive COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: : Given the necessity to control the spread of this epidemic domestically and abroad, the focus of COVID-19 prevention and control has shifted. In Shanghai, measures taken to prevent COVID-19 spread were very successful. Early isolation and quarantine are necessary and effective measures.","output":"Characteristics of Confirmed Novel Coronavirus Disease Cases at Shanghai East Hospital: A Retrospective Single-Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has been a global public health problem since December 2019. Higher education institutions are risky areas for the transmission of COVID-19. But, still there is insufficient information on the prevention of the disease in this setting. OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge, attitude, and prevention practices towards COVID-19 among students of Ethiopian higher education institutions. METHODS: Institutin -based cross-sectional study design was conducted from December 1 to 30, 2020 among randomly selected 407 undergraduate students from higher education institutions in Ethiopia. The outcome variables were knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19. Binary logistic regression models at 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the factors affecting knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and independently associated with outcome variables at 95% CI. RESULTS: About 75.9% (95% CI: 72.2C79.9%) of University students had a good knowledge, 62.4% (95% CI: 58.2C67.1%) had a positive attitude, and 56.8% (95% CI: 52.6C61.9%) had a good COVID-19 prevention practices. Students over the age of 30 (AOR=5.8; 95% CI: 1.5, 10.6), third-year students (AOR=3.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 8.9), and being health science students (AOR=4.4; 95% CI: 2.2, 8.9) were significantly associated with a good knowledge towards COVID-19. Urban residents (AOR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.3C0.9), having an average family monthly income of $75USD (AOR=3.5; 95% CI: 1.8C6.7), use of at least one type of social media (AOR=4.7; 95% CI: 1.7C12.9), and having a positive attitude (AOR=2.2; 95% CI: 1.3C3.5) were significantly associated with COVID-19 prevention practices. CONCLUSION: Despite three-fourths of the participants had a good knowledge, the attitude and prevention practices were low. Age, study year, College of study, presence of chronic illnesses, use of social media, family income, and residence were factors of knowledge, attitude, and prevention practices towards COVID-19.

Relatively few studies have investigated the association between clinical and cost outcomes and nutritional risk in immobile older inpatients, particularly those with neoplasms, injury, digestive, cardiac, and respiratory conditions. Methods: This China-wide prospective observational cohort study comprised 5,386 immobile older inpatients hospitalized at 25 hospitals. All patients were screened for nutritional risk using the Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS 2002). A descriptive analysis of baseline variables was followed by multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards models and generalized linear model) to compare the health and economic outcomes, namely, mortality, length of hospital stay (LoS), and hospital costs associated with a positive NRS 2002 result. Results: The prevalence of a positive NRS 2002 result was 65.3% (n = 3,517). The prevalence of at-risk patients (NRS 2002 scores of 3+) was highest in patients with cardiac conditions (31.5%) and lowest in patients with diseases of the respiratory system (6.9%). Controlling for sex, age, education, type of insurance, smoking status, the main diagnosed disease, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), the multivariate analysis showed that the NRS 2002 score = 3 [hazard ratio (HR): 1.376, 95% CI: 1.031C1.836] were associated with approximately a 1.5-fold higher likelihood of death. NRS 2002 scores = 4 (HR: 1.982, 95% CI: 1.491C2.633) and NRS scores  5 (HR: 1.982, 95% CI: 1.498C2.622) were associated with a 2-fold higher likelihood of death, compared with NRS 2002 scores <3. An NRS 2002 score of 3 (percentage change: 16.4, 95% CI: 9.6C23.6), score of 4 (32.4, 95% CI: 24C41.4), and scores of  5 (36.8, 95% CI 28.3C45.8) were associated with a significantly (16.4, 32.4, and 36.8%, respectively) higher likelihood of increased LoS compared with an NRS 2002 scores <3. The NRS 2002 score = 3 group (17.8, 95% CI: 8.6C27.7) was associated with a 17.8%, the NRS 2002 score = 4 group (31.1, 95% CI: 19.8C43.5) a 31.1%, and the NRS 2002 score  5 group (44.3, 95% CI: 32.3C57.4) a 44.3%, higher likelihood of increased hospital costs compared with a NRS 2002 scores <3 group. Specifically, the most notable mortality-specific comorbidity and LoS-specific comorbidity was injury, while the most notable cost-specific comorbidity was diseases of the digestive system. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high burden of undernutrition at the time of hospital admission on the health and hospital cost outcomes for older immobile inpatients. These findings underscore the need for nutritional risk screening in all Chinese hospitalized patients, and improved diagnosis, treatment, and nutritional support to improve immobile patient outcomes and to reduce healthcare costs.","output":"Nutritional Risk, Health Outcomes, and Hospital Costs Among Chinese Immobile Older Inpatients: A National Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the mechanisms involved in the causation of acute-phase coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we have come across clinical cases that have been shown to run a protracted course of COVID-19 with complex clinical findings related to organ systems in general and the CNS in particular that deserve to be addressed in the COVID long-haulers, for which the more clinically-related term chronic COVID syndrome (CCS) has been coined recently.

RESULTS: Out of 1401 patients admitted at the participating centres with confirmed diagnosis of COVID\\\\19, 226 (16.1%) underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and were included in the present analysis. In\\\\hospital death occurred in 68 patients (30.1%). At multivariable analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, P < .001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, P < .001) and ARDS (P < .001) were independently associated with in\\\\hospital mortality.

This suggests that the development of psychopathology is not only limited to the brain, but rather involves an additional systemic aspect, accounting for the large body of evidence demonstrating co-presentation of mental illness with chronic inflammatory conditions and metabolic syndromes. Studies have shown that inflammatory processes underlie the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with recent studies revealing not only correlative, but causative relationships between the immune system and psychopathology. Lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise may influence psychopathology, and this may occur via a bidirectional relationship. Mental illness may prevent health-seeking behaviours such as failing to maintain a balanced diet, whilst adopting a 'healthy' diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fish alongside nutritional supplementation correlates with a reduction in psychiatric symptoms in patients. Obesity and the gut microbiome have proven to be further factors which play an important role in inflammatory signalling and the development of psychiatric symptoms. In a related paper we focus on the role of exercise (another significant lifestyle factor) on mental health (Venkatesh et al. 2020). Lifestyle modifications which target diet and nutrition may prove therapeutically beneficial for many patients, especially in treatment-resistant subgroups. The current evidence base provides equivocal evidence, however future studies will prove significant, as this is a highly attractive therapeutic avenue, due to its cost efficacy, low side effect profile and preventative potential.

He was assessed to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as shown by rapid progression of hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrate. He was then treated with moxifloxacin, remdesivir, dexamethasone, unfractionated heparin (UFH) pump, and multivitamins. During admission, his respiratory symptoms got worse, so he transferred to the ICU for NIV support. On the ninth day of admission, he had gross hematuria followed by a rapid fall of platelet count. We used two different scoring systems (4Ts and HEP scoring system) to confirm the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Following the discontinuation of UFH injection, the thrombocyte continued to rise, and hematuria disappeared.Conclusion: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk of severe disease and mortality among COVID-19 patients.

Stock market investment intention also had a significant effect on stock market participation. Stock market investment intention was also found to successfully mediate the relationships of risk tolerance and overconfidence bias with stock market participation. When it comes to stock market investment, the government and related authorities should focus on developing programs and policies that provide a financial safety net for investors and promote investment-related social platforms. This study linked risk tolerance, financial well-being, financial literacy, overconfidence bias, herding behavior, social interaction, stock market investment intention, and stock market participation. This is one of the few early attempts to address issues in light of the stock market investment participation among the working adults in a developing country.","output":"Predicting Stock Market Investment Intention and Behavior among Malaysian Working Adults Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak had an effect on healthcare. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presentation and management of patients with acute appendicitis. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting with acute appendicitis to the emergency department of a large tertiary center during March and April 2020. Clinical features, diagnostic workup, and management were compared. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients presented with acute appendicitis during the pandemic compared to 60 patients during the same time the year before. There were no significant differences in patient demographics: age (P = 0.65), gender (P = 0.73), smoking status (P = 0.48). During COVID-19 patients were more likely to complain of right lower quadrant pain (100% vs. 78.3%, P &lt; 0.01). Rates of surgical treatment was similar (83.8% vs. 81.7%, P = 1);mean operative time was longer during COVID-19 (63  23 vs. 52  26 minutes, P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in intra-operative findings including the presence of appendiceal perforation (16.3% vs. 14.5%, P = 0.8), abscess (6.1% vs. 9.7%, P = 0.73), or involvement of cecum or terminal ileum (14.28% vs. 19.63%, P = 1).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, case series of MM patients have demonstrated a poor outcome in those who required hospitalization due to COVID-19, and there are few data regarding those managed out of hospitals or risk factors for hospitalization. In Brazil, where the scenario is of restricted resources to treat MM patients and large numbers of COVID-19 cases and related death, the outcome can be even worse. Objective: To assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in Brazilian patients with MM. This retrospective case series investigated 81 MM patients with documented COVID-19, managed in and out-hospital, from 8 states, representing 4 of 5 regions in Brazil. This study has been conducted by Grupo Brasileiro de Mieloma (GBRAM), and the present analyses included cases from April 2020 to July 2021. Clinical features and risk factors were analyzed with the severity of COVID-19 and outcomes (hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ventilatory support, and death). The frequency of MM treatment modification due to COVID-19 was also accessed. There were 81 MM patients (male 50%; median age 63 years; and ISS III at diagnosis 25%) diagnosed with COVID-19. At least one comorbidity was present in 47 (58%) patients: most frequently hypertension and diabetes (56% and 27%). Twenty-eight (35%) patients had more than one comorbidity. At COVID episode, 21 (26%) patients had an active disease or progression disease, and 40% received at least two prior lines of treatment. COVID-19 management required hospitalization in 49 (61%), ventilatory support in 30 (40%) and ICU in 28 (35%). Hospitalization was associated with age (p=0.008), presence of comorbidity (p=0.02), hypertension (p=0.02), presence of fever (p=0.005) and low respiratory symptoms (p=0.003). Ventilatory support was more frequent in patients with cardiac disease (p=0.05), receiving immunomodulatory (p=0.03), or monoclonal drugs (p=0.006). Patients receiving corticosteroids (p=0.02), immunomodulatory (p=0.06), or monoclonal drugs (p=0.06) in MM treatment had a higher frequency of ICU admission. By adjusted multivariate analysis, age, the clinical presentation with fever and low respiratory symptoms (p<0.001, p=0.05 and p=0.001, respectively) were independent associated with hospitalization; low respiratory symptoms and MM therapy including monoclonal drugs (p=0.07 and p=0.02) were associated with ventilatory support; therapy with corticosteroids and immunomodulatory drugs (p=0.019 and p=0.05) were associated with ICU admission. Overall mortality was 29%. Mortality rates were 47%, 68%, and 77% in hospitalized, ventilatory support, and ICU patients, respectively. By univariate analysis, age, ECOG performance status, and MM therapy including corticosteroids, were associated with increased mortality. By multivariate model, only ECOG performance status remained as an independent risk factor for death. ISS, prior lines of therapy, prior stem cell transplantation, and disease status at COVID-19 were not associated with any analyzed outcomes. MM patients who recovered from COVID had the current MM treatment delayed in 61% of cases. In this series, COVID-19 MM patients had a very high frequency of hospitalization, ventilatory support requirement, ICU admission, and deaths due to COVID-19. Although not associated with increased mortality, prior therapy drug classes were associated with severity of manifestation in our series. We also observed a high frequency of MM treatment delay in recovered patients, and the post-COVID clinical impact should be more explored. The high mortality observed reinforces the importance of preventing COVID-19, such as social distancing, wearing masks, and vaccination. Disclosures De Queiroz Crusoe: Janssen: Research Funding.

In all ISEM methods, one of the components of the system is adsorbed to a solid phase. In AG-CGT, PA-CGT, and AB-CGT, one of the reagents is adsorbed to an electron microscopic grid, while in PA-CBT protein A is naturally present on the surface of a bacterium that serves as a solid support. In ISEM methods, the viruses can be statistically evaluated and numerically expressed as number of virions per unit of area, and can, therefore, be statistically evaluated. Thus, these methods optimize the results of a test by quantifying the effects of the quality of the supporting grid, the time of adsorption, the pH, the presence of salts, and the type of staining.

After duplicate record removal, and title and abstract screening, 43 articles were eligible for full-text review. Of these, 10 studies meeting the inclusion criteria of the review were finally included. Results: Older adults were satisfied with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients were in favor of telemedicine compared to in-person visits, but the evidence support for this preference was limited. Factors influencing satisfaction were identified and categorized under four main categories: system-related factors, patient-related factors, socioeconomic factors, and factors related to the nature of the medical intervention. Conclusions: Older adults were satisfied with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. A positive trend of preference toward telemedicine was observed, but not well established due to the lack of an objective measure of assessment. Technical issues related to the telemedicine delivery system were the main challenges. The socioeconomic status and level of education of older adults can relatively influence the level of satisfaction with telemedicine.

The two sensors that are commonly used as infrared thermometers are the MLX90614 and AMG8833 because of their high temperature range and good accuracy. However, the measurement results can be affected by the measuring distance, room temperature, and physical activity in the human body. Therefore, an infrared thermometer with two sensors arranged in overlay was designed to evaluate the performance of infrared thermal sensors based on measuring distances (15, 30, 40, and 60 cm), 2 rooms (26.4 oC and 30 oC), and physical activity on the object. The results in the 30 oC room at 15 C 40 cm show measured temperature above 36 oC for both sensors, while in the 26.4 oC room it decreased up to 35.32 oC.

Therefore, their metabolic properties and the effects on activity of cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) enzymes and drug transporters should be considered into when developing the most efficient treatments for patients. METHODS Scientific literature on the interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, with human P450 enzymes and drug transporters was searched using PUBMED.Gov (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the ADME database (https://life-science.kyushu.fujitsu.com/admedb/). RESULTS Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by P450 1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 in vitro and by P450s 2C8 and 3A4/5 in vivo by N-deethylation. Chloroquine effectively inhibited P450 2D6 in vitro; however, in vivo inhibition was not apparent except in individuals with limited P450 2D6 activity. Chloroquine is both an inhibitor and inducer of the transporter MRP1 and is also a substrate of the Mate and MRP1 transport systems. Hydroxychloroquine also inhibited P450 2D6 and the transporter OATP1A2. CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine caused a statistically significant decrease of P450 2D6 activity in vitro and in vivo, inhibiting also its own metabolism by the enzyme. The inhibition indicates a potential for clinical drug-drug interactions when taken with other drugs that are predominant substrates of the P450 2D6.

Methods: This is a population-based household survey conducted every 15 days, between June and September 2020 and January and February 2021. In total, 11 phases were performed. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was identified in venous blood using a lateral flow test, Wondfo Biotech. In the last phase, it was combined with an immunoenzymatic test, Euroimmun. Participants also answered a semi-structured questionnaire on sociodemographic and economic factors and social distancing measures. Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were estimated according to the region, Human Development Index, sex, age group, ethnicity, education, income and variables associated with risk or prevention of the infection. To compare the frequencies among the categories of each variable, the chi-square test with Rao Scott correction was used, considering a 5% significance level. Results: In total, 23,397 individuals were interviewed and had their samples collected. The estimated prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 9.7% (95%CI: 7.9-11.8%) to 25.0% (95%CI: 21.7-28.7). The prevalence of individuals with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was higher among black and pardo people, people with lower schooling, people with lower income and among residents of regions with lower Human Development Index. The lowest prevalences were associated with recommended measures of disease protection. The proportion of asymptomatic infection was 45.1%. Conclusion: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower than the cumulative incidence variation, except for the last phase of the study. The differences in prevalence estimates observed among subpopulations showed the social inequality as a risk of infection.

Interestingly, immunesenescence is more profound in males when compared to females, whilst accelerated aging of the immune system, termed premature immunesenescence, has been described in obese subjects and T2D patients. Thus, as three distinct demographic groups with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 share a common immune profile, could immunesenescence be a generic contributory factor in the development of severe COVID-19? Here, by focussing on three key aspects of an immune response, namely pathogen recognition, elimination and resolution, we address this question by discussing how immunesenescence may weaken or exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We also highlight how aspects of immunesenescence could render potential COVID-19 treatments less effective in older adults and draw attention to certain therapeutic options, which by reversing or circumventing certain features of immunesenescence may prove to be beneficial for the treatment of groups at high risk of severe COVID-19.","output":"Immunesenescence: A Predisposing Risk Factor for the Development of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Follow-up studies of COVID-19 survivors have been performed to characterize persistence of long-term symptoms, but data are scarce on one year of follow-up.

However, its effect on the reproduction of root-knot nematode is poorly understood. In this study, the natural metabolite FAc was found to exhibit reproductive toxicity on Meloidogyne incognita and Caenorhabditis elegans. The number of germ cells of C. elegans was observed to decrease after exposure to FAc, with a reduction of 59.9% at a dose of 200 mg/L. FAc in various concentrations induced the germ-cell apoptosis of C. elegans, with an increase over six-fold in the number of apoptotic germ cells at 200 mg/L. These findings suggested that FAc decreased the brood size of nematode by inducing germ-cell apoptosis. Moreover, FAc-induced germ-cell apoptosis was suppressed by the mutation of gene hus-1, clk-2, cep-1, egl-1, ced-3, ced-4, or ced-9. The expression of genes spo-11, cep-1, and egl-1 in C. elegans was increased significantly after FAc treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that nematode exposure to FAc might inflict DNA damage through protein SPO-11, activate CEP-1 and EGL-1, and induce the core apoptosis pathway to cause germ-cell apoptosis, resulting in decreased brood size of C. elegans.","output":"Reproductive Toxicity of Furfural Acetone in Meloidogyne incognita and Caenorhabditis elegans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a high risk of thrombosis. The laboratory documentation of hypercoagulability and impaired fibrinolysis remains a challenge. Our aim was to assess the potential usefulness of viscoelastometric testing (VET) to predict thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients according to the literature. We also (i) analyzed the impact of anticoagulation and the methods used to neutralize heparin, (ii) analyzed whether maximal clot mechanical strength brings more information than Clauss fibrinogen, and (iii) critically scrutinized the diagnosis of hypofibrinolysis. We performed a systematic search in PubMed and Scopus databases until 31st December 2020. VET methods and parameters, and patients features and outcomes were extracted. VET was performed for 1063 patients (893 intensive care unit (ICU) and 170 non-ICU, 44 studies). There was extensive heterogeneity concerning study design, VET device used (ROTEM, TEG, Quantra and ClotPro) and reagents (with non-systematic use of heparin neutralization), timing of assay, and definition of hypercoagulable state. Notably, only 4 out of 25 studies using ROTEM reported data with heparinase (HEPTEM). The common findings were increased clot mechanical strength mainly due to excessive fibrinogen component and impaired to absent fibrinolysis, more conspicuous in the presence of an added plasminogen activator. Only 4 studies out of the 16 that addressed the point found an association of VETs with thrombotic events. So-called functional fibrinogen assessed by VETs showed a variable correlation with Clauss fibrinogen. Abnormal VET pattern, often evidenced despite standard prophylactic anticoagulation, tended to normalize after increased dosing. VET studies reported heterogeneity, and small sample sizes do not support an association between the poorly defined prothrombotic phenotype of COVID-19 and thrombotic events.","output":"Viscoelastometric Testing to Assess Hemostasis of COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this paper is to review some of the causes of secondary headache particularly focusing on the subcategories of secondary headache in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, the clinical features of these headaches, and their associated features and management.

As such, investigating the Webquesting behavior of university students in general and TEFL (Teaching English as a foreign language) students in particular during the Covid 19 seems essential. Since information-seeking behavior can be influenced by various factors we aimed to explore the attitude of TEFL students towards webquesting. In the next phase of the study, we sought the barriers to TEFL students' Webquesting behaviour. Accordingly, the present research employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The statistical population consisted of 128 TEFL students and the sampling method was purposeful. The findings of this study revealed that the students were not satisfied with their webquesting and that there were two major obstacles in their webquesting, namely, learners' constraints and teachers' constraints. The inhibitors included lack of familiarity with Internet sources, poor information seeking skills, lack of interest in some topics, lack of skills in using the Internet, poor English proficiency, teachers' lack of CALL (computer assisted language learning) preparation, lack of help from the side of teachers, teachers' lack of attention to non-textbook resources, and students' lack of motivation and time. Findings have implications for TEFL teachers, since, based on the qualitative data, the most important source of information for students is textbooks and the most important goal of searching for information is for doing homework. The importance of textbooks for students is the result of the pivotal role given to the text books by teachers and the final exams. Perhaps students' lack of interest in webquesting is partly due to such an undue emphasis. On the other hand, students' lack of interest in Webquesting was also due to the lack of attention and encouragement from the side of teachers to use the Internet resources.","output":"Web Questing in Tefl Courses: What Factors Deter the Students' Information-seeking Behavior?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest biopsychosocial emergency the world has faced for a century. The pandemic has changed how individuals live and work, and in particular, frontline healthcare professionals have been exposed to alarming levels of stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand the professional and personal effects of COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons working in the UK National Health Service (NHS). SETTING: Surgical departments in the NHS. DESIGN: Between May and July 2020, as part of an ongoing study, we asked surgeons two open-ended questions: 'What challenges are the COVID-19 crisis currently presenting to you in your work and home life?' and 'How is this stress affecting you personally?' Thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data. Responses to the second question were also categorised into four groups reflecting valence: positive, neutral, mildly negative and strongly negative. RESULTS: A total of 141 surgeons responded to the survey and the results indicated that 85.8% reported that they were generally negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 7.8% were strongly affected in a negative way. Qualitative thematic analysis identified four key themes from responses relating to the impact of the pandemic: (1) changing and challenging work environment as a result of COVID-19; (2) challenges to professional life and development; (3) management of change and loss in the respondents' personal lives; (4) emotional and psychological impacts. CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the substantial emotional and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons' mental health, particularly in relation to fear and anxiety, loss of motivation, low mood, stress and burnout. There is an urgent need for workplace support and mental health interventions to help surgeons cope with the difficulties they face during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Psychological and occupational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK surgeons: a qualitative investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strengthening health systems and maintaining essential service delivery during health emergencies response is critical for early detection and diagnosis, prompt treatment, and effective control of pandemics, including the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

CRC health disparities experienced by African Americans are due in part to the later stage of diagnosis, suggesting the importance of improving African Americans CRC screening participation. The national Screen to Save (S2S) initiative employs a community health educator to deliver CRC screening education which can be tailored for specific populations, and such approaches have increased CRC screening rates in disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority populations. METHODS/DESIGN: In this trial emphasizing stool-based CRC screening, focus groups informed the development of an adapted S2S video and brochure tailored for African Americans and identified preferred motivational text messages for a multicomponent community health advisor (CHA) intervention. A CHA hired from the community was trained to deliver a 6-week CRC educational intervention consisting of an initial face-to-face meeting followed by 5 weeks of calls and texts. Interested eligible persons are enrolled primarily through recruitment by two partnering community health centers (CHCs) and secondarily through various outreach channels and, after consenting and completing a baseline survey, are randomly assigned to one of two study arms. The CHCs are blinded to study arm assignment. Intervention arm participants receive the brochure and CHA intervention while participants assigned to the control group receive only the brochure. All participants receive a stool-based CRC screening test from their health center, and the primary outcome is the completion of the screening test at 12 months. Secondary objectives are to estimate the effect of the intervention on mediating factors, explore the effect of moderating factors, and perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the CHA intervention. DISCUSSION: The TUNE-UP study will enhance understanding about CRC screening in African Americans obtaining primary health care through CHCs and is one of the very few studies to examine a CHA intervention in this context. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which the intervention affects patient beliefs and behaviors will help focus future research while the exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis will inform CHCs decision-making about implementing a CHA program to increase screening and reduce cancer health disparities.

One of the essential poor characteristics is the involvement of coagulopathy. Simple coagulation parameters, including prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet, are widely accessible in many health centers. Objectives: This meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between simple coagulation profiles and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Method: We systematically searched five databases for studies measuring simple coagulation parameters in COVID-19 on admission. The random-effects and inverse-variance weighting were used in the study, which used a standardized-mean difference of coagulation profile values. The odds ratios were computed using the Mantel-Haenszel formula for dichotomous variables. Results: This meta-analysis comprised a total of 30 studies (9,175 patients). In our meta-analysis, we found that non-survivors had a lower platelet count [SMD =-0.56 (95% CI:-0.79 to-0.33), P < 0.01;OR = 3.00 (95% CI: 1.66 to 5.41), P < 0.01], prolonged PT [SMD = 1.22 (95%CI: 0.71 to 1.72), P < 0.01;OR = 1.86 (95%CI: 1.43 to 2.43), P < 0.01], prolonged aPTT [SMD = 0.24 (95%CI:-0.04 to 0.52), P = 0.99], and increased INR [SMD = 2.21 (95%CI: 0.10 to 4.31), P = 0.04] than survivors.

RECENT FINDINGS Only a limited number of neonatal and pediatric metabolomic studies have been published, in comparison to the adult. However, this number of pediatric and neonatal papers is constantly increasing. The latest papers are related to intrauterine growth restricted and small for gestational age neonates, prematurity, mode of delivery, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, persistent ductus arteriosus, respiratory syndrome and surfactant therapy, cytomegalovirus infection, nephrouropathy, inborn errors of metabolism, pharmametabolomics, and nutrimetabolomics (including study of maternal milk and formula). Also numerous papers have been presented in experimental neonatology. In particular, the fluids most frequently used were as follows: urine, cord blood plasma, but also milk and stools. Each condition or disease presents a specific discriminating set of metabolites, which can be considered like a 'bar code'. SUMMARY In the near future, improved tools for metabolomic analysis (like simplified 'dipsticks' for urine) and its integration with other 'omics' will make this technology available in the clinical setting, leading to better or easier clinical decision making. Urinary metabolomics will probably be one of the most used tools in pediatrics and the metabolome will be 'our world'.","output":"Metabolomics in the developing infant."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2016, the surprise successes of the UK Vote Leave and Donald Trumps Presidential campaigns defied most expectations.

In this study, we quantified the endogenous melatonin levels in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The melatonin concentrations in root, stem, and leaf were 150.60, 37.92, and 40.58 ng g fresh weight- 1, respectively. The effects of exogenous melatonin (1 M) on plant growth, photosynthesis, antioxidant enzyme activity, and ion homeostasis in upland cotton seedlings exposed to 100 mM NaCl treatment were determined. Pretreatment (prior to exposure to salt stress) of seedlings with exogenous melatonin significantly alleviated plant growth inhibition by salt stress and maintained an improved photosynthetic capacity. The application of melatonin also significantly reduced the salt-induced oxidative damage, possibly through the accumulation of osmotic regulatory substances and the activation of antioxidant enzymes. We also showed that exogenous melatonin regulated the expression of stress-responsive and ion-channel genes under salinity, which could contribute to improved salt tolerance in cotton. Taken together, our study provides evidence that cotton contains endogenous melatonin, and it may have unraveled crucial evidence of the role of melatonin in cotton against salt stress.","output":"Mitigation of salt stress response in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) by exogenous melatonin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If mainstream media meant one sender and inordinate receivers, nowadays, new media brought the chance and challenge to have numberless senders and receivers at the same time, in a network of information Along with polyphonic chunks, inaccurate information penetrates the echochambers we create The danger is that unless timely spotted, it sows disinformation and polarization The solution resides in media literacy skills, in raising awareness over types of communication products meant for malicious use especially within social media where user generated content contributes to proliferating and spreading the content at incredible speed The present paper is meant to present ways that help individuals avoid being subject to mal-intended behavioural and cognitive influence","output":"Media Literacy Tools in Combating Disinformation and Fake News in Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peoples perceptions of their intelligence correlate only moderately with objective intelligence measures.

The attenuation of oxidative status is one of the alternatives for neuroprotection and anti-aging. Auricularia polytricha (AP), an edible mushroom, contains many therapeutic properties, including antioxidant properties. Herein, we report the effects of AP extracts on antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-aging activities. The neuroprotective effect of AP extracts against glutamate-induced HT-22 neuronal damage was determined by evaluating the cytotoxicity, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and expression of antioxidant enzyme genes. Lifespan and healthspan assays were performed to examine the effects of AP extracts from Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that ethanolic extract (APE) attenuated glutamate-induced HT-22 cytotoxicity and increased the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes. Moreover, APE promoted in the longevity and health of the C. elegans. Chemical analysis of the extracts revealed that APE contains the highest quantity of flavonoids and a reasonable percentage of phenols. The lipophilic compounds in APE were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), revealing that APE mainly contains linoleic acid. Interestingly, linoleic acid suppressed neuronal toxicity and ROS accumulation from glutamate induction. These results indicate that AP could be an exciting natural source that may potentially serves as neuroprotective and anti-aging agents.","output":"Neuroprotective Effects against Glutamate-Induced HT-22 Hippocampal Cell Damage and Caenorhabditis elegans Lifespan/Healthspan Enhancing Activity of Auricularia polytricha Mushroom Extracts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Trans-right axillary aortic valve replacement (TAX-AVR) remains uncommon. We developed a special method to pull the heart closer to the right chest wall to make the surgery as easy and safe as aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy. Because the retraction sutures lifting the ascending aorta and aortic root are arranged circularly around the wound, we named this technique \\"Stonehenge technique\\". METHODS We examined 47 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement through a small right infra-axillary thoracotomy as the initial surgical therapy. These patients were divided into two groups: the conventional TAX-AVR group that underwent AVR via the conventional small right axillary incision approach (n = 20) and the TAX-AVR with SH group that underwent AVR with the Stonehenge technique (n = 27). RESULTS The aortic cross-clamp and the extracorporeal circulation time were significantly shorter in the TAX-AVR with SH group than in the conventional TAX-AVR group (conventional TAX-AVR group: 125.5  47.9; TAX-AVR with SH group: 96.0  14.0, p = 0.004, and conventional TAX-AVR group: 163.8  55.9; TAX-AVR with SH group: 140.0  16.8, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION The outcomes of this technique depend on the site of the retraction sutures in the opened pericardium, direction of pull, amount of force applied, and precautions taken. If performed correctly, the ascending aorta and the root can be pulled from the wound to within the surgeon's fingers' reach, thereby reducing aortic cross-clamp and extracorporeal circulation times in group of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via right infra-axillary thoracotomy.","output":"Stonehenge technique is associated with faster aortic clamp time in group of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via right infra-axillary thoracotomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute encephalopathy is one of the most frequent neurological complication in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

However, the extremely low oral bioavailability of Pae (approximately 3%-4%) limits its formulation development and clinical application. This study aimed to develop micelles using the glycyrrhizic acid (GL) as the carrier to improve the oral absorption of Pae. METHODS Pae loaded GL micelles were prepared by the ultrasonic dispersion method and its formulation was optimized by single-factor tests. Characterizations of Pae loaded GL micelles including particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading (DL), morphology, and drug release in vitro were carried out. The single-pass intestinal perfusion and pharmacokinetic studies of Pae loaded GL micelles were also evaluated in rats and compared with Pae solution and the mixed solution of Pae and GL. RESULTS The optimized Pae loaded GL micelles had EE of (42.21  0.89)%, particle size of (58.89  4.24) nm with PDI of (0.194  0.010), zeta potential of (-24.40  1.90) mV. Pae loaded GL micelles showed a nearly spherical shape under TEM. Drug release of micelles demonstrated a delayed drug release compared to Pae solution. The single-pass intestinal perfusion study showed a significantly higher permeability of Pae in duodenum (P < 0.05), jejunum (P < 0.05), ileum (P < 0.01) and colon (P < 0.01) intestine after perfusion of Pae loaded GL micelles as compared to Pae solution. The in vivo pharmacokinetics demonstrated that the Cmax and AUC0-t values of Pae loaded GL micelles were approximately 2.18- and 3.64-fold superior than the Pae solution.

Here, PM2.5 was monitored and collected in central China, and its cytotoxicity mechanism on human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was investigated. With the average concentration of 109  69 g/m3, PM2.5 was rich in heavy metals and organic pollutants. After exposure to PM2.5, the viability of BEAS-2B cells decreased, where 510 dysregulated genes were predicted to induce necroptosis via inhibiting ATP synthesis through the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway. Cellular experiments demonstrated that the content of ATP was downregulated, while the expression of RIP3, a necroptosis indicator, was upregulated. Besides, four enzymes in charge of ATP synthesis were downregulated, including ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, while two genes of RELA and CAPN1 responsible for necroptosis were upregulated. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine was applied as an enhancer for ATP synthesis, which reversed the downregulation of ATP5F, NDUF, and COX7A, and consequently alleviated the elevation of RELA, CAPN1, and RIP3. In conclusion, PM2.5 exposure downregulates ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, and that inhibits ATP synthesis via the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, which subsequently upregulates RELA and CAPN1 and ultimately leads to necroptosis of BEAS-2B cells.","output":"Mechanism of PM2.5-induced human bronchial epithelial cell toxicity in central China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common illness, yet little is known about its pathogenesis, including the role played by respiratory viruses.

The purpose of this study is to measure how deep the energy poverty problem in Ukraine is and how it changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying selected quantitative and financial indicators, the authors showed the problem of energy poverty in Ukraine remained acute at the beginning of 2020, especially in terms of heating. Moreover, its level in Ukraine was three times higher than the average level for the all the EU countries. Furthermore, in 2020, during the pandemic, there were drastic increasing arrears of households on utility bills that meant a new leap of energy poverty in Ukraine. This study did not search for the causes of the identified leap in energy poverty, which apparently connected with the global and local economic and social consequences of the pandemic. However, it revealed the depth of this problem and the lower impact of the nature factor (air temperature) on energy poverty during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: : We determined plasma coagulation pathway protein levels in PCOS (n=146) and control (n=97) women recruited to a PCOS biobank. Circulating levels of a panel of 18 clotting pathway proteins were determined by Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement. Results: : Cohorts were age matched, though PCOS had elevated body mass index (BMI)(p<0.001), insulin (p<0.001) and C-reactive protein (CRP)(p<0.0001). Eight pro-coagulation proteins were elevated in PCOS: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)(p<0.0001), fibrinogen (p<0.01), fibrinogen gamma chain (p<0.0001), fibronectin (p<0.01), von Willebrand factor (p<0.05), D-dimer (p<0.0001), P-selectin (p<0.05), and plasma kallikrein (p<0.001). However, two anticoagulant proteins, vitamin K-dependent protein-S (p<0.0001) and heparin cofactor-II (p<0.001) were elevated and prothrombin was decreased (p<0.05). CRP, as a marker of inflammation, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) correlated with 11 and 6 of the clotting proteins, respectively (p<0.05). When matched for BMI<25 (16 PCOS, 53 controls) HOMA-IR remained elevated (p<0.05) and heparin cofactor-II was increased (p<0.05). In a multivariate analysis accounting for inflammation, insulin resistance and BMI, there was no correlation of PCOS with any of the coagulation proteins. Conclusion: The hypercoagulable State in PCOS can be fully accounted for by BMI, inflammation and insulin resistance suggesting that only obese PCOS women would be predisposed to an enhanced risk for severe COVID-19-related disease.","output":"Metabolic Consequences Of Obesity On The Hypercoagulable State Of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Risk For Severe SARS-Cov-2 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had a significant impact on teaching and learning in postgraduate education In particular, work integrated learning, in health care settings, has been disrupted in many ways negatively impacting student learning Our Clinical Redesign courses are designed to deliver work-integrated learning in partnership with healthcare organisations to deliver workplace projects in real time, which has been complicated by COVID-19 This reflection examines the challenges that arose in the healthcare redesign teaching and learning space during the COVID-19 pandemic We explore the experiences of our work-integrated learning students using Johns' reflection model (1) Our students faced disruption to their education, workplaces and personal lives, and the experiences of our teaching team whose teaching philosophies were challenged In response to the ongoing challenges, we developed strategies for supporting our students including the development of virtual projects for students who no longer had access to their workplaces or project appropriate resources","output":"Delivering a work-integrated learning postgraduate course during COVID-19: Experiences, challenges and strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, several challenges appeared before everyone.

(2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery.

Then, we discuss the main graphical representations for EIS data, including a scope of the foundation principles of Nyquist, Bode phase angle, Bode magnitude, capacitance and Randles plots, followed by detailed step-by-step explanations of the corresponding calculations that evolve from these graphs and direct examples from the literature highlighting practical applications of EIS for characterization of different types of materials. In addition, we discuss various applications of EIS technique for materials research.","output":"Reducing the resistance for the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis in materials chemistry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted all aspects of social, professional, and financial life, with concerns and responses being readily published in online social media worldwide. This study employs probabilistic text mining techniques for a large-scale, high-resolution, temporal, and geospatial content analysis of Twitter related discussions. Analysis considered 20,230,833 English language original COVID-19-related tweets with global origin retrieved between January 25, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Fine grain topic analysis identified 91 meaningful topics. Most of the topics showed a temporal evolution with local maxima, underlining the short-lived character of discussions in Twitter. When compared to real-world events, temporal popularity curves showed a good correlation with and quick response to real-world triggers. Geospatial analysis of topics showed that approximately 30% of original English language tweets were contributed by USA-based users, while overall more than 60% of the English language tweets were contributed by users from countries with an official language other than English. High-resolution temporal and geospatial analysis of Twitter content shows potential for political, economic, and social monitoring on a global and national level.","output":"A high-resolution temporal and geospatial content analysis of Twitter posts related to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of endovascular repair for aortic arch lesions is increasing thanks to fenestrated endoprothesis. In emergency situations the availability of these endografts is not always possible. We present the case of a patient with recent COVID-19 infection and a symptomatic aortic arch pseudoaneurysm treated with a physician-made fenestrated endograft and externalized guidewires.","output":"Endovascular treatment of the aortic arch securing the supraaortic trunks through in-situ fenestration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased brachial systolic blood-pressure (BP) predicts diabetes (T2DM) but is not fully effective. Value of absolute ankle systolic BP for T2DM compared to brachial systolic BP is not known. Our objectives were to assess independent relationships of ankle-systolic BP with T2DM and cardiovascular disease in Europeans and south Asians. Cross-sectional studies of anonymised data from registered adults (n = 1087) at inner city deprived primary care practices. Study includes 63.85% ethnic minority. Systolic BP of the left and right-brachial, posterior-tibial and dorsalis-pedis-arteries measured using a Doppler probe. Regression models factors were age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and waist height ratio (WHtR). Both brachial and ankle systolic-BP increase with diabetes in Europeans and south Asians. We demonstrated that there was a significant positive independent association of ankle BP with diabetes, regardless of age and sex compared to Brachial. There was stronger negative association of ankle blood pressure with cardiovascular disease, after adjustment for BMI, WHtR and ethnicity. Additionally, we found that ankle BP were significantly associated with cardiovascular disease in south Asians more than the Europeans; right posterior tibial. Ankle systolic BPs are superior to brachial BPs to identify risks of Type 2DM and cardiovascular diseases for enhanced patient care.","output":"Differential associations of ankle and brachial blood pressures with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases: cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study contains the dataset of ECG images of Cardiac and COVID-19 patients. This rare dataset contains 1937 distinct patient records, data is collected using ECG Device 'EDAN SERIES-3' installed in Cardiac Care and Isolation Units of different health care institutes across Pakistan. The collected ECG images data were manually reviewed by medical professors using Telehealth ECG diagnostic system, under the supervision of senior medical professionals with experience in ECG interpretation. The manual reviewing process of ECG images took several months to review the five distinct categories (COVID-19, Abnormal Heartbeat, Myocardial Infarction (MI), Previous History of MI, and Normal Person). The collected data contains 12 leads-based ECG images dataset can be used by Data Scientist, IT Professional and Medical Research Institutes to design, compare, fine-tune classical techniques and Deep learning methods in studies focused on COVID-19, Arrhythmia, and other cardiovascular conditions.
