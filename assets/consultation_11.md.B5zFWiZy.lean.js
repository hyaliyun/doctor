In the province of British Columbia, the Ministry of Health initiated a collaborative evidence-informed process involving a steering committee of representatives from the six health authorities. A Core Functions (CF) Framework was developed, identifying 21 core public health programs. For each core program, an evidence review was conducted and a model core program paper developed. These documents were distributed to health authorities to guide development of their own renewed public health services. The CF implementation was conceptualized as an embedded knowledge translation process. A CF coordinator in each health authority was to facilitate a gap analysis and development of a performance improvement plan for each core program, and post these publically on the health authority website. METHODS: Interviews (n = 19) and focus groups (n = 8) were conducted with a total of 56 managers and front line staff from five health authorities working in the Healthy Living and Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention core programs. All interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed and verified by the project coordinator. Five members of the research team used NVivo 9 to manage data and conducted a thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged concerning implementation of the CF Framework generally, and the two programs specifically. The themes were: youve told me what, now tell me how; the double bind; but we already do that; and the selling game. Findings demonstrate the original vision of the CF process was lost in the implementation process and many participants were unaware of the CF framework or process. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed with respect to a well-known framework on the adoption, assimilation, and implementation of innovations in health services organizations. Despite attempts of the Ministry of Health and the Steering Committee to develop and implement a collaborative, evidence-informed policy intervention, there were several barriers to the realization of the vision for core public health functions implementation, at least in the early stages. In neglecting the implementation process, it seems unlikely that the expected benefits of the public health renewal process will be realized.","output":"Fading vision: knowledge translation in the implementation of a public health policy intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melasma is a common, difficult to treat hyperpigmentary disorder.

A 43-year-old man presented to our hospital with a complaint of fever, for which he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and antiviral therapy with favipiravir and ciclesonide was started subsequently. The fever persisted for the first few days of treatment, but his respiratory status was stable, and he became asymptomatic and afebrile on day 9. Although the PCR tests remained positive, he met the updated discharge criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) on day 12. However, his fever recurred, and his condition worsened on day 16. A chest X-ray showed a new opacity. It is likely that favipiravir and ciclesonide treatment probably did not completely eliminate the virus in the patient, and therefore the infection persisted. We added remdesivir from day 21, and the improvement was remarkable. He was discharged on day 29 after two consecutive PCR test results were negative. PCR tests are not mandatory for the updated WHO discharge criteria. However, even after antiviral therapy, COVID-19 patients with hematologic malignancies may have prolonged active infection with impaired viral excretion. Depending on the background disease and comorbidities, there may be some patient populations for whom it is not appropriate to simply comply with the current discharge criteria.

Vaccines and antiviral drugs have improved patient response to the infection, but the long-term effect on vital organs is still unknown. Investigations are now focused on supportive nutrient therapies, which can mitigate the susceptibility as well as the long-term complications of COVID-19.

Recently, the Ministry of Education of the Peoples Republic of China required the establishment of the system of High-quality Online and Offline Courses, which indicates that online courses will play an important role in higher education. Furthermore, the number of pathologists currently cannot satisfy clinical needs. To solve this health issue and implement the policy from the Ministry of Education, it is necessary to improve the current state of pathology education. First, we need to know students opinions of the current courses and their professional choices. METHODS: Online questionnaires covering the quality of traditional courses, attitudes towards online courses, and suggestions for optimizing courses were designed and applied. Whether students want to become pathologists and the underlying reasons for this interest are also included in this survey. Participants are medical students from certain colleges in Nanjing. The collected data were assessed by statistical analyses, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Of the 342 valid responses, 60.94% of undergraduate students showed their interest in pathology courses, and among them, 48.72% expressed that they may become pathologists. However, the corresponding percentage is only 29.59% in the group without interest. To optimize curricula, the top two suggestions are introducing more clinical cases (undergraduate students, 64.45%; graduate students, 79.09%) and making the classes lively and interesting (undergraduate students, 59.77%; graduate students, 62.79%). Approximately 80.00% of students consider online courses to be good supplementary materials to traditional courses, and approximately half prefer an online-offline mixed learning model. Salary, interest, and employment status are the main factors influencing students professional choices. CONCLUSIONS: Students are generally satisfied with traditional pathology courses, and online courses are good supplementary materials in their opinions. It has been suggested that clinical cases be introduced in classes. It is more likely that students who have an interest in pathology will become pathologists. The data from this survey also show that the main causes of the shortage of pathologists are a lack of engaging work and an unsatisfactory salary.","output":"A survey on the attitudes of Chinese medical students towards current pathology education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the core driving forces for the future development of the medical industry, but patients are skeptical about the use of AI in medical care.

This observation raised questions about the occurrence and causative microorganisms of bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients, especially in the perspective of the widely reported overuse of antibiotics and the rising rate of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on blood culture results in influenza A, influenza B and COVID-19 patients presenting to two hospitals in the Netherlands. Our main outcome consisted of the percentage of positive blood cultures. The percentage of clinically relevant blood cultures, isolated bacteria and 30-day all-cause mortality served as our secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1331 viral episodes were analysed in 1324 patients. There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.47) in overall occurrence of blood culture positivity in COVID-19 patients (9.0, 95% CI 6.8C11.1) in comparison to influenza A (11.4, 95% CI 7.9C14.8) and influenza B patients (10.4, 95% CI 7.1C13.7,). After correcting for the high rate of contamination, the occurrence of clinically relevant bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients amounted to 1.0% (95% CI 0.3C1.8), which was statistically significantly lower (p = 0.04) compared to influenza A patients (4.0, 95% CI 1.9C6.1) and influenza B patients (3.0, 95% CI 1.2C4.9). The most frequently identified bacterial isolates in COVID-19 patients were Escherichia coli (n = 2) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2).

For the enteroviruses, replication organelles form at Golgi membranes in a process that utilizes PI4KIII. Other picornaviruses, for example the cardioviruses, are believed to initiate replication at the endoplasmic reticulum and subvert PI4KIII to generate PI4P. Here we investigated the role of PI4KIII in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication. Our results showed that, in contrast to the enteroviruses and the cardioviruses, FMDV replication does not require PI4KIII (PI4KIII and PI4KIII), and PI4P levels do not increase in FMDV-infected cells and PI4P is not seen at replication organelles.

Numerous publications which came out following the lockdowns only reinforced this view by seeing Covid-19 as an opportunity to think more about the environment. However, these narratives are largely anecdotal, assumptive and pay little attention to the question of what people actually think about the lockdowns in environmental terms. To fill this gap, this study provides the empirical basis needed to either support or reject the aforementioned dominant narrative on Covid-19 and environment. Survey data (eighty questionnaires per country) were collected from participants in Cameroon (Buea), Egypt (Cairo), Italy (several major cities) India (Mumbai and New Delhi), and The Netherlands (mainly Amsterdam). The findings of this study reveal that generally, Covid-19 has not changed the way most people think about the environment. This is either because people were already pro-environmental before Covid-19, or people see Covid-19 and the visible environmental changes as temporal phenomenon. One other major observation in this study is the regional differences in environmental attitudes in relation to Covid-19. The least change in environmental attitudes was observed in high-income countries and the most change in low-middle-income countries. Therefore, the paper concludes that the importance of Covid-19 on a more sustainable future should not be overplayed or overemphasised.

The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs. 10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs. 12.15%, P=0.015). More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group. There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups.

However, the compressive strength of concrete may also be reduced due to additional voids in the hydrated cement matrix. In this study, we fabricated a delayed absorption type of SAP (I-SAP) composed of cross-linked modified acrylate and studied its absorption characteristics and effect on compressive strength after 28 days. Furthermore, the effect of curing conditions on the strength of concrete and hydrated cement paste with SAP were investigated. The absorption capacity of I-SAP in the synthetic pore solution and deionised water was examined and compared with that of a conventional SAP, and the former was absorbed more by I-SAP. The results revealed that the compressive strength of concrete increased with the addition of I-SAP, particularly with the curing condition of 60% RH. Although the compressive strength of hydrated cement paste with I-SAP reduced in water or sealed curing conditions, no loss of strength in the paste cured at 60% RH was seen. The cement matrix densification due to hydration of belite around the SAP surface is the main mechanism for strength development in concrete cured at sealed and 60% RH. However, the voids formed by SAP control the compressive strength of hydrated paste.","output":"Delayed Absorption Superabsorbent Polymer for Strength Development in Concrete."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A CFD-based numerical model was integrated with the WellsCRiley equation to numerically assess the risk of airborne influenza infection in a popular means of public transportation, e.g. the bus microenvironment. Three mixing ventilation methods, which are widely used in current bus configurations, and an alternative displacement ventilation method were numerically assessed in terms of their ability to limit the risk of airborne influenza infection. Furthermore, both the non air-recirculation and air-recirculation with filtration ventilation modes were investigated in terms of the influenza infection probability. According to the simulation results, air-recirculation mode with high efficiency filtration was found to cause almost the same infection risk as non air-recirculation mode (100% outdoor air supply), which indicated a potential benefit of filtration in reducing the infection risk. Additionally, for the commonly used mixing ventilation methods, air distribution method, location of return/exhaust opening and seat arrangement affected the airborne transmission of influenza between passengers. The displacement ventilation method was found to be more effective in limiting the risk of airborne infection. Overall, the developed numerical model can provide insights into how the micro-environmental conditions affect airborne infection transmission in buses.

Herein, we describe the first case of another critical disorder, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), in a healthy individual after COVID-19 vaccination. A 43-year-old Chinese farmer developed malaise, vomiting, and persistent high fever (up to 39.7 C) shortly after receiving the first dose of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The initial evaluation showed pancytopenia (neutrophil count, 0.70  109/L; hemoglobin, 113 g/L; platelet, 27  109/L), elevated triglyceride (2.43 mmol/L), and decreased fibrinogen (1.41 g/L). Further tests showed high serum ferritin levels (8140.4 g/L), low NK cell cytotoxicity (50.13%-60.83%), and positive tests for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. Hemophagocytosis was observed in the bone marrow. Therefore, HLH was confirmed, and dexamethasone acetate (10 mg/day) was immediately prescribed without etoposide. Signs and abnormal laboratory results resolved gradually, and the patient was discharged. HLH is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by aberrantly activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells, which may rapidly progress to terminal multiple organ failure. In this case, HLH was induced by the COVID-19 vaccination immuno-stimulation on a chronic EBV infection background. This report indicates that it is crucial to exclude the presence of active EBV infection or other common viruses before COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic spreading all around the world, the higher learning institutions were forced to shut or limit the person in contact to control the spread of diseases. Under this circumstance, remote learning that emphasized learning via online setting embraced in higher education to replace the physical classroom during the pandemic time.

The remote learning PBL module conducted using reflection method to assess the students' experiences in PBL learning. On the other hand, a set of survey questionnaires was distributed to 34 undergraduate students to gather the responses for the assessment of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This study employed both quantitative and qualitative analysis to investigate the students critical thinking, problem-solving skills and their experience in remote learning PBL. Using paired sample t-test to test the difference between pre- and post- remote learning PBL class, results indicated that there was a significant improvement of students critical thinking and problem-solving skills after remote learning PBL class. On the other hand, thematic analysis on students feedback on remote learning PBL class- first, second, and third meeting, indicated that students gradually improved their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Although students implied positive feedback on the class, however, some of them were facing difficulties in understanding the module or physical disruptions that distract their learning. The findings gave insights for the lecturers to design a suitable learning course during the pandemic time.

This study is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of composting using meal from dead pigs through physicochemical analyses and phytotoxic assays. Five treatments were tested, all including 50% sawdust: T1, with 50% slaughterhouse sludge (control); T2, with 20% slaughterhouse sludge and 30% meal from dead pigs; T3, with 10% slaughterhouse sludge and 40% meal from dead pigs; T4, with 20% organic stabilizing compost and 30% meal from dead pigs and T5, with 30% organic stabilizing compost and 20% meal from dead pigs. The phytotoxicity assays used lettuce, cucumber, celia, soybean, rice and wheat as bioindicators. Inclusion of meal from dead pigs was related to reduction in pH, C/N ratio, humidity and temperatures inside the pile, although thermophilic peaks lasted longer than 50 days and the final composts showed high content of nitrogen and phosphorous. The germination of bioindicators was reduced in all tested treatments, compared to the control. The composts from treatments that included meal from dead pigs presented acceptable nutrient content, which may indicate their use as organic fertilizers. However, after 4 months, all bioindicators in contact with such composts presented impaired germination.

The costs of investigational medicinal products (IMPs) in IITs and the role of hospital pharmacies in the planning of IITs are unclear. We conducted a mixed-methods study to compare planned and actual costs of IMPs in Swiss IITs, to examine potential reasons for differences, and to gather stakeholder views about hospital services for IITs. METHODS: We included all IITs with IMP services from the Basel hospital pharmacy invoiced between January 2014 and June 2020 (n = 24). We documented trial and IMP characteristics including planned and actual IMP costs. Our working definition for a substantial cost difference was that the actual IMP costs were more than 10% higher than the planned IMP costs in a trial. We conducted semi-structured interviews with investigators, clinical trials unit and hospital pharmacy staff, and qualitatively analyzed transcribed interviews. RESULTS: For 13 IITs we observed no differences between planned and actual costs of IMPs (median, 11000 US$; interquartile range [IQR], 8882C16302 US$), but for 11 IITs we found cost increases from a median of 11000 US$ (IQR, 8922C36166 US$) to a median over 28000 US$ (IQR, 13004C49777 US$). All multicenter trials and 10 of 11 IITs with patients experienced substantial cost differences. From the interviews we identified four main themes: 1) Patient recruitment and organizational problems were identified as main reasons for cost differences, 2) higher actual IMP costs were bearable for most investigators, 3) IMP services for IITs were not a priority for the hospital pharmacy, and 4) closer collaboration between clinical trial unit and hospital pharmacy staff, and sufficient staff for IITs at the hospital pharmacy could improve IMP services. CONCLUSIONS: Multicenter IITs enrolling patients are particularly at risk for higher IMP costs than planned. These trials are more difficult to plan and logistically challenging, which leads to delays and expiring IMP shelf-lives. IMP services of hospital pharmacies are important for IITs in Switzerland, but need to be further developed.","output":"Investigational medicinal products, related costs and hospital pharmacy services for investigator-initiated trials: A mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a growing evidence base describing population health approaches to improve blood pressure control.

We previously demonstrated the ability of a newly developed polymer to provide controlled release of an antibiotic in a linear fashion over 45 d. We subsequently showed that coating mesh with the drug-releasing polymer prevented a Staphylococcus aureus (SA) infection in vivo. To broaden the applicability of this technology, the polymer was synthesized as isolated \\"microspheres\\" and loaded with vancomycin (VM) before conducting a noninferiority analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-three mice underwent creation of a dorsal subcutaneous pocket that was inoculated with 104 colony forming units (CFU) of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled SA (105 CFU/mL). Multifilament polyester mesh (7  7 mm) was placed into the pocket, and the skin was closed. Mesh was either placed alone (n = 16), coated with VM-loaded polymer (n = 20), placed next to VM-loaded microspheres (n = 20) or unloaded microspheres (n = 10), or flushed with VM solution (n = 7). Quantitative tissue/mesh cultures were performed at 2 and 4 week. Mice with open wounds and explanted mesh were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-two of 23 (96%) tissue-mesh samples from mesh alone or empty miscrospheres were positive for GFP-labeled SA at 2 and 4 wk. Six of seven (86%) samples from the VM flush group were positive for GFP SA at 4 wk. Thirty-eight of 38 (100%) VM-loaded crosslinked cyclodextrin polymers-coated mesh or VM-loaded microspheres were negative for GFP SA at 2 and 4 wk.

Setting and participants Physicians in Dutch nursing homes. Methods Respondents were asked to describe a recent case in which they had a discussion on anticipatory medical care decisions, and to indicate whether ACP was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic in that specific case and in general. Answers were independently coded and a codebook was compiled in which the codes were ordered by themes that emerged from the data. Results A total of 129 questionnaires were filled out. Saturation was reached after analyzing 60 questionnaires. Four main themes evolved after coding the questionnaires: reasons for ACP discussion, discussing ACP, topics discussed in ACP and decision-making in ACP. COVID-19 specific changes in ACP indicated by respondents included: (1) COVID-19 infection as a reason for initiating ACP, (2) a higher frequency of ACP discussions, (3) less face-to-face contact with surrogate decision makers, and (4) intensive care unit admission as an additional topic in anticipatory medical decision making.

This paper introduced three indicators to measure the infection risk of covid-19 under mitigation measures: the infection rate, the primary risk of infection and daily risk of infection. Two factors are introduced to consider the impact of mitigation measures on infection risk in Hong Kong. They are the number of trips per day and the percentage of people wearing face masks. With these two mitigation measures, the daily risk of infection was reduced from 1826.11 per million to 644.58 per million in the peak of covid-19 infection on 2 August 2020.

Lactoferrin, an innate metal-transport protein, synthesized in the substantia nigra, particularly in dopaminergic neurons and activated microglia is vital for brain physiology. Lactoferrin rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis and accumulates in the brain capillary endothelial cells. Lactoferrin receptors are additionally present on glioma cells, brain micro-vessels, and neurons. As a regulator of neuro-redox, microglial lactoferrin is critical for protection/repair of neurons and healthy brain function. Iron imbalance and oxidative stress are common among patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, and multiple sclerosis. As an endogenous iron-chelator, lactoferrin prevents iron accumulation and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease patients. Oral lactoferrin supplementation could modulate the p-Akt/PTEN pathway, reduce A? deposition, and ameliorate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Novel lactoferrin-based nano-therapeutics have emerged as effective drug-delivery systems for clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders.

Existing capabilities of smartphones include the exchange of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals and of audio signals, as well as the use of gyroscopes and magnetic sensors. The Bluetooth power measurements, which are often used today, may be complemented by audio ranging and attitude estimation in the future. Smartphones are worn in different ways, often in pockets and bags, which makes the propagation of signals and thus the classification rather unpredictable.

However, its impact on fresh fruit and vegetable vendors remains unclear; these are often smaller, more community centered, and may lack the financial infrastructure to withstand supply and demand changes induced by such crises. OBJECTIVE: This study documents the methodology used to assess fresh fruit and vegetable vendor closures in New York City (NYC) following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by using Google Street View, the new Apple Look Around database, and in-person checks. METHODS: In total, 6 NYC neighborhoods (in Manhattan and Brooklyn) were selected for analysis; these included two socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods (Upper East Side, Park Slope), two socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (East Harlem, Brownsville), and two Chinese ethnic neighborhoods (Chinatown, Sunset Park). For each neighborhood, Google Street View was used to virtually walk down each street and identify vendors (stores, storefronts, street vendors, or wholesalers) that were open and active in 2019 (ie, both produce and vendor personnel were present at a location). Past vendor surveillance (when available) was used to guide these virtual walks. Each identified vendor was geotagged as a Google Maps pinpoint that research assistants then physically visited. Using the notes feature of Google Maps as a data collection tool, notes were made on which of three categories best described each vendor: (1) open, (2) open with a more limited setup (eg, certain sections of the vendor unit that were open and active in 2019 were missing or closed during in-person checks), or (3) closed/absent. RESULTS: Of the 135 open vendors identified in 2019 imagery data, 35% (n=47) were absent/closed and 10% (n=13) were open with more limited setups following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When comparing boroughs, 35% (28/80) of vendors in Manhattan were absent/closed, as were 35% (19/55) of vendors in Brooklyn. Although Google Street View was able to provide 2019 street view imagery data for most neighborhoods, Apple Look Around was required for 2019 imagery data for some areas of Park Slope. Past surveillance data helped to identify 3 additional established vendors in Chinatown that had been missed in street view imagery. The Google Maps notes feature was used by multiple research assistants simultaneously to rapidly collect observational data on mobile devices. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology employed enabled the identification of closures in the fresh fruit and vegetable retail environment and can be used to assess closures in other contexts. The use of past baseline surveillance data to aid vendor identification was valuable for identifying vendors that may have been absent or visually obstructed in the street view imagery data.

However, socializing in a safe context (i.e. over the phone, video-chat, etc.) is especially important during this time of crisis. Therefore, in this narrative review, we suggest the term 'distant socializing' as more apt expression, to promote physical distancing measures while also highlighting the importance of maintaining social bonds. Further, articles discussing the practice, implementation, measurement, and mental health effects of physical distancing are reviewed. Physical distancing is associated with psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety and depression), suicidal ideation, and domestic violence. Further, unemployment and job insecurity have significantly increased during COVID-19, which may exacerbate these negative mental health effects. Governments, medical institutions, and public health bodies should therefore consider increasing mental health resources both during and after the pandemic, with a specific focus on frontline workers, COVID-19 survivors, and marginalized communities.","output":"'Distant socializing,' not 'social distancing' as a public health strategy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effusion is the abnormal accumulation of fluid within a body cavity that can result from a variety of disease processes.

The mechanism of organ tropism and innate immune evasion of DPV has not been completely deciphered due to a lack of cell models to study the innate immune manipulation and pathogenicity of aquatic viruses. In the present study, we isolated five types of duck primary cells [duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), neurons, astrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocytes/macrophages] to identify appropriate cell models for DPV, using tropism infection and innate immunologic assays. Cells responded differently to stimulation with DNA viruses or RNA virus analogs. DPV infection exhibited broad tropism, as the recombinant virulent strain (CHv-GFP) infected DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, but not the PBMCs, as the expression of EGFP was negligible. The basal levels of innate immunity molecules were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lower in DEFs and astrocytes. Conversely, the titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain was higher in DEFs and astrocytes than in neurons and monocytes/macrophages. The titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain were higher compared with the virulent strain in DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes. The innate immune response was not significantly induced by either DPV strain in DEFs, neurons, or astrocytes. The virulent strain persistently infected monocytes/macrophages, but the attenuated strain did so abortively, and this was accompanied by the phenomenon of innate immune inhibition and activation by the virulent and attenuated strains, respectively. Blockage of IFNAR signaling promoted replication of the attenuated strain. Pre-activation of IFNAR signaling inhibited infection by the virulent strain. The selection assay results indicated that induction of innate immunity plays an essential role in controlling DPV infection, and monocytes/macrophages are an important cell model for further investigations. Our study provided practical methods for isolating and culturing duck primary cells, and our results will facilitate further investigations of organ tropism, innate immune responses, latent infection, and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating DPV and potentially other aerial bird pathogens.","output":"Isolation and Selection of Duck Primary Cells as Pathogenic and Innate Immunologic Cell Models for Duck Plague Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fabian Rivers, recent graduate rep on BVA Council, spares a thought for those graduating during the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Graduating in lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the binding of viral S-protein (spike protein) to human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

From human sequence databases, we identified nine ACE2 variants at ACE2-S-protein binding sites. We used both experimental assays and protein structure analysis to evaluate the effect of each variant on the binding affinity of ACE2 to S-protein. We found one variant causing complete binding disruption, two and three variants, respectively, strongly and mildly reducing the binding affinity, and two variants strongly enhancing the binding affinity. We then collected the ACE2 gene sequences from 57 nonhuman primates. Among the 6 apes and 20 Old World monkeys (OWMs) studied, we found no new variants. In contrast, all 11 New World monkeys (NWMs) studied share four variants each causing a strong reduction in binding affinity, the Philippine tarsier also possesses three such variants, and 18 of the 19 prosimian species studied share one variant causing a strong reduction in binding affinity. Moreover, one OWM and three prosimian variants increased binding affinity by >50%. Based on these findings, we proposed that the common ancestor of primates was strongly resistant to and that of NWMs was completely resistant to SARS-CoV-2 and so is the Philippine tarsier, whereas apes and OWMs, like most humans, are susceptible.

Although these pathogens activate host inflammasomes to regulate pathogen expansion, the mechanisms by which pathogen toxins contribute to inflammasome activation remain poorly understood. Here we show that activation of inflammasomes by Listeria infection is promoted by amino acid residue T223 of listeriolysin O (LLO) independently of its pore-forming activity. LLO T223 is critical for phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor ASC at amino acid residue Y144 through Lyn-Syk signaling, which is essential for ASC oligomerization. Notably, a Listeria mutant expressing LLO T223A is impaired in inducing ASC phosphorylation and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, the virulence of LLO T223A mutant is markedly attenuated in vivo due to impaired ability to activate the inflammasome. Our results reveal a function of a pathogen toxin that exacerbates infection by promoting phosphorylation of ASC.","output":"Listeria toxin promotes phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor ASC through Lyn and Syk to exacerbate pathogen expansion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women in the United States criminal legal (CL) system are at the nexus of several drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic, including incarceration, poverty, chronic illness and racism.

Methods: Uncinate process tissues were obtained from 61 chronic rhinosinusitis patients (of which, 39 had allergy and 22 did not) who were infected with HRV16 using an air-liquid interface organ culture system. The expression levels of programmed cell death-ligand (PD-L)1, PD-L2, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), IFN-?3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were evaluated in the infected nasal mucosa. Results: The HRV infection rates were not significantly different between allergy (74.4 %) and non-allergy (72.7 %) groups. In the allergy group, the expression of PD-L1 (P=0.013) and IL-10 (P=0.040) was significantly elevated in the HRV-infected tissues; there was a strong correlation between PDL1 and IL-10 (r= 0.868, P<0.001). In contrast, infected tissues from the non-allergy group displayed increased levels of IL-4 (P=0.039), IL-5 (P=0.023), and IFN-?3 (P=0.031) as well as an increased IL-4/IFN-?3 ratio after HRV infection (P=0.043). Conclusion: This study shows that, regardless of the presence of allergy, HRV infection rates are similar in the nasal mucosa of patients with CRS.

Using simple randomization, we assigned them to two groups. Multimedia and live demonstrations were used in the intervention (n=21) and control (n=23) groups, respectively. Knowledge of students was assessed using pre-test and post-test. Practical skills were compared using the students' final semester scores. The Individual Development and Educational Assessment questionnaire was used to assess the students' reaction to instruction. For data analysis, mean and standard deviation, and independent and paired t-tests were used. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: In terms of knowledge, the pre-test scores of the intervention and control groups were not significantly different (p-value= 0.457), and the post-test scores of the two intervention and control groups had no significant difference (p-value= 0.053); however, in both intervention and control groups there was a significant difference between the scores before and after the test, and the scores of both groups increased after training (p-value= 0.001, p-value= 0.001). In terms of practical skills, no significant difference was observed in the mean and standard deviation of the scores in the two groups (p-value=0.902). There was no significant difference in terms of the students' reaction to instruction. CONCLUSION: All students passed this course successfully. Further, their knowledge and skills were improved in both groups. Similar to the live practical demonstration, that of the multimedia led to a positive reaction to instruction in students.

Then, applying sequential auction theory, we propose first- and second-price sealed-bid sequential auction models and design quota auction pricing mechanisms. Through theoretical and numerical analysis, we obtain the equilibrium strategy and analyze the impact of selection and on developers' bidding pricing on quota. The results show that the selection can enhance the developer's quota bidding price and farmers' income. And the higher the value of selection to the developer, the higher the quota bidding price and farmer's income. Contrarily, the larger the number of developers, the smaller the quota bidding price and farmers' income. Finally, the quota bidding price and farmers' income in the second-price sealed-bid sequential auction are higher than in the first-price sealed-bid sequential auction.","output":"Auction mechanism on construction land quota with selection on land location"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic created a global, complex crisis, without a clear end in sight, presenting an existential threat to many hospitality businesses Drawing on stakeholder theory, we develop a framework for recovery strategy development for COVID-19, which engages salient stakeholders in the process of recognizing challenges, rationalizing changes needed and refashioning ways of working The framework is used to analyze the process of development of a recovery strategy for a boutique hotel in England, UK, via a case study methodology The analysis brings to the fore the interdependencies between the hotel owners and its employees, customers, governments, suppliers and communities, at local, national and international levels Moreover, the analysis shows how collaborating with these stakeholders leads to the identification of revenue streams for the hotel, operational modifications and even the development of new commercial partnerships","output":"Stakeholders of the World, Unite!: Hospitality in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the detection of the first imported case of COVID-19 in the northern sector of Ghana, we molecularly characterized and phylogenetically analysed sequences, including three complete genome sequences, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 obtained from nine patients in Ghana.

We also assessed the potential impact that long-distance transport of samples to testing centres may have on sequencing results. Here, two samples that were similar in terms of viral RNA concentration but were transported from sites that are over 400 km apart were analyzed. All sequences were compared to previous sequences from Ghana and representative sequences from regions where our patients had previously travelled. Three complete genome sequences and another nearly complete genome sequence with 95.6% coverage were obtained. Sequences with coverage in excess of 80% were found to belong to three lineages, namely A, B.1 and B.2.

This study employs the principles of the four-stage adaptive cycle to quantify the perspectives of major stakeholders regarding resilience readiness in Austrian society and to explore the implications. At the FASresearch company in Vienna, 278 representatives from 15 key sectors of Austrian society were asked to estimate the resilience of their respective sectors and identify the key resilience factors for each sector. Results pinpoint the most critical stakeholders and resilience factors, highlight the importance of quality relationships among stakeholders, and indicate that while stakeholders accurately perceive the stages of growth (r), equilibrium (K), and regeneration (), they tend to underestimate the significance of the final () stage of the adaptive cycle, characterized by disturbance and collapse of outdated systems. Improved recognition and preparation for each stage may result in the increased resilience of each sector to potential crises in the future. Notably, perspectives regarding resilience in the face of a crisis were gathered prior to the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, in addition to fulfilling an analytic-diagnostic function, resilience monitoring techniques are also intended as an adaptive tool for novel resilience management.

Drawing on archival research in Geneva and interviews with current and former WHO staff, consultants and programme partners, we identify three stages in this relationship. Although since its founding individuals within WHO occasionally engaged with religious actors, it was not until the 1970s, when the primary healthcare strategy was developed in consultation with the Christian Medical Commission, that their concerns began to influence WHO policies. By the early 1990s, the failure to roll out primary healthcare globally was accompanied by a loss of interest in religion within WHO. With the spread of HIV/AIDS however, health-related religious beliefs were increasingly recognised in the development of a major quality of life instrument by the Division of Mental Health, and the work of a WHO expert committee on cancer pain relief and the subsequent establishment of palliative care. While the 1990s saw a cooling off of activities, in the years since, the HIV/AIDS, Ebola and COVID-19 crises have periodically brought religious actors to the attention of the organisation. This study focusses on what we suggest may be understood as a trend towards a closer association between the activities of WHO and religious actors, which has occurred in fits and starts and is marked by attempts at institutional translation and periods of forgetting and remembering.","output":"Religion and the World Health Organization: an evolving relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A verifica?ao dessa altera?ao constante se d por diferentes vias, dentre as quais se destacam a sociolgica e a o do ponto de vista da atividade. 2 Pela via sociolgica (Antunes, 2020;Boltanski & Chiapello, 2009;Linhart, 2017) as mutaes sao captadas nos seus caracteres gerais, nas suas tendencias, nas suas orientaes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with SARS-COV2 between March-1-2020 and January-31-2021 to identify the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 by smoking status. RESULTS: We identified 10216 SARS-COV2-positive patients with complete documentation of smoking habits. Within 14 days of a SARS-COV2 positive test, 1150 (11.2%) patients were admitted and 188 (1.8%) died. Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized from COVID-19 than current or never smokers (21.2% former smokers; 7.3% current smokers; 10.4% never smokers, p<0.0001). In univariable analysis, former smokers had higher odds of hospitalization from COVID-19 than never smokers (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.94-2.74). This association remained significant when analysis was adjusted for age, race and gender (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.55), but became non-significant when analysis included Body Mass Index, previous hospitalization and number of comorbidities (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86-1.29). In contrast, current smokers were less likely than never smokers to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized and died from COVID-19 than current or never smokers. This effect is mediated via age and comorbidities in former smokers.","output":"Smoking and risk of COVID-19 hospitalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing a novel drug is a complex, risky, expensive and time-consuming venture. It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion USD. Fortunately, this scenario has recently changed with the arrival of new approaches. Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most representative examples of molecules identified by means of it. Key principles are illustrated through case studies including specifically successful achievements in the field of anticancer drug design to demonstrate that research advances, with the aid of in silico drug design, have the potential to create novel anticancer drugs.","output":"Application of computational methods for anticancer drug discovery, design, and optimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the modulation of Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) associated to the efficacy of Electroacupuncture (EA) in the reduction of climacteric symptoms.

These restrictions may be particularly difficult for adolescents, who rely heavily on their peer connections for emotional support. However, there has been no longitudinal research examining the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' mental health, and moderators of change, as well as assessing the factors perceived as causing the most distress. Two hundred and forty eight adolescents (Mage = 14.4; 51% girls; 81.8% Caucasian) were surveyed over two time points; in the 12 months leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak (T1), and again two months following the implementation of government restrictions and online learning (T2). Online surveys assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction at T1 and T2, and participants' schooling, peer and family relationships, social connection, media exposure, COVID-19 related stress, and adherence to government stay-at-home directives at T2 only. In line with predictions, adolescents experienced significant increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety, and a significant decrease in life satisfaction from T1 to T2, which was particularly pronounced among girls. Moderation analyses revealed that COVID-19 related worries, online learning difficulties, and increased conflict with parents predicted increases in mental health problems from T1 to T2, whereas adherence to stay-at-home orders and feeling socially connected during the COVID-19 lockdown protected against poor mental health. This study provides initial longitudinal evidence for the decline of adolescent's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that adolescents are more concerned about the government restrictions designed to contain the spread of the virus, than the virus itself, and that those concerns are associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and decreased life satisfaction.","output":"Risk and Protective Factors for Prospective Changes in Adolescent Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite tremendous resources being invested in prevention and treatment, breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer deaths in women globally.

Here, we have developed a rapid electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) sensor for quantifying the overall immune activity of the patients. Since during the cytokine storm many types of cytokines are elevated in the blood, there is no need for specific detection of a single type of cytokine and the collective behavior is just measured without any electrode functionalization.

This systematic review and meta-analysis addressed the effect of mitigation measures against COVID-19 on preterm birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, and NICU admission during the first nine months of the pandemic. A search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase and SCOPUS for manuscripts published up until 24th May 2021. Studies that reported perinatal outcomes (preterm birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, NICU admission) during the COVID-19 pandemic with a pre-pandemic control period were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using ROBINS-I tool. RevMan5 was used to perform meta-analysis with random-effects models. A score of the stringency of mitigation measures was calculated from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Thirty-eight studies of moderate to serious risk of bias were included, with varied methodology, analysis and regional mitigation measures, using stringency index scores. There was no overall effect on preterm birth at less than 37 weeks (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92C1.00).

Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a seed gene; ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells. Surprisingly, this 166-gene signature was conserved in all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes classified disease severity, inspiring the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP signatures, respectively. The ViP signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and apoptosis determines severity/fatality. Precise therapeutic goals were formulated and subsequently validated in high-dose SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters using neutralizing antibodies that abrogate SARS-CoV-2?ACE2 engagement. IL15/IL15RA were elevated in the lungs of patients with fatal disease, and plasma levels of the cytokine tracked with disease severity.

METHODS A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P < 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%).

METHODS: Based on county data from the nationwide tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Slovakia between 31.10.C1.11. 2020 we calculate a lower confidence bound for the specificity. As positive test results were not systematically verified by PCR tests, we base the lower bound on a worst case assumption, assuming all positives to be false positives. RESULTS: 3,625,332 persons from 79 counties were tested. The lowest positivity rate was observed in the county of Ro?ava where 100 out of 34307 (0.29%) tests were positive. This implies a test specificity of at least 99.6% (97.5% one-sided lower confidence bound, adjusted for multiplicity).

The primary objective of the study was to identify the total direct expenditure of patients during febrile neutropenia with clinical consequences and the secondary aim was to find out the factors associated with higher cost. Materials and Method: This was a single-centered hospital-based study in the largest and only specialized cancer care centre in Bangladesh in the government sector. This prospective study was done in the inpatients department of the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital from April 2020 to January 2021. The primary outcome was the out-of-pocket patient payments (adjusted by government subsidy) per FN episode. Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression were conducted to identify the factors associated with higher costs. Results and Discussions: A total of 101 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean (SD) age was 33.49 (15.79) years. Of the 101 participants, 63.4% were male.Among the patients, 13.9% died during the episode and 86.1% recovered. Having co-morbidities and COVID-19 were associated with an increased risk of death. The mean cost was US$ 999.44 (499.05) and the mean length of hospital stay was 21.98 (9.3) days.

We sought to determine the relationship between compliance with this program and risk factor control in SAMMPRIS. METHODS SAMMPRIS aggressive medical management included a telephonic lifestyle modification program provided free of charge to all subjects (n = 451) during their participation in the study. Subjects with fewer than 3 expected lifestyle-coaching calls were excluded from these analyses. Compliant subjects (n = 201) had greater than or equal to 78.5% of calls (median % of completed/expected calls). Noncompliant subjects (n = 200) had less than 78.5% of calls or refused to participate. Mean risk factor values or % in-target for each risk factor was compared between compliant versus noncompliant subjects, using t tests and chi-square tests. Risk factor changes from baseline to follow-up were compared between the groups to account for baseline differences. RESULTS Compliant subjects had better risk factor control throughout follow-up for low-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure (SBP), hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c), non-high-density lipoprotein, nonsmoking, and exercise than noncompliant subjects, but there was no difference for body mass index. After adjusting for baseline differences between the groups, compliant subjects had a greater change from baseline than noncompliant subjects for SBP did at 24 months and HgA1c at 6 months.

This study aims to analyze the role of probiotics on severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In the current retrospective single-center study, we collected data of 311 consecutive severe patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 3rd to Feb 20th, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and medication characteristics were compared and analyzed between patients with or without probiotics. RESULTS: In total, 93 of the 123 patients (75.61%) who were treated with probiotics survived to hospital discharge with the median inpatient day of 32 days and mean virus clearance time of 23 days, which were significantly longer than those of patients without probiotics. There were no bias in laboratory parameters, except for IL-6 and ESR, which were significantly higher in patients treated probiotics. We tracked the dynamic changes of 8 selected laboratory parameters (IL-6, CRP, total T lymphocytes, NK cells, B lymphocyte, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio) and found that probiotics could not reduce the increased IL-6 levels but possessed the ability to moderate the immunity and decreased the incidence of secondary infection in COVID-19 patients.

Whether this equates to reduced vaccine effectiveness in SOTR or impacts disease severity is not yet known. We used the IDSA Emerging Infections Network (EIN) to identify SARS-CoV-2 cases in vaccinated SOTR. We describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: On 4/7/21, we requested case reports via the EIN listserv of COVID-19 infection following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in immunocompromised individuals. Case reports were collected until June 7(th). Online data collection included patient demographics, dates of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration and clinical data related to COVID-19 infection. We performed a descriptive analysis of these patient factors and compared differences between early onset (< / = 21 days after completing vaccine series) and late onset infection ( > 21 days after completing vaccine series). RESULTS: As of 6/7/21, 34 cases of COVID-19 infection after vaccination in SOTR were submitted. Most cases (79%) occurred in individuals who were fully vaccinated. Only 3 cases (8.5%) occurred in SOTR within their first year after transplantation. Clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The vaccine administration date was known for 26 SOTR among whom symptoms occurred a median of 26.5 days (IQR 21.75 days, range 5-79 days) after completing the COVID-19 vaccine series. Twenty-three SOTR (68%) required hospitalization of which 12 had critical illness. Outcome data was available for 29 individuals of whom 20 (69%) demonstrated improvement. When comparing SOTR with early versus late onset COVID-19 infection in relation to vaccination timing, there were no differences in disease severity (80% vs 75% with severe or critical disease, p=NS) or outcome (30% vs 31% died or deteriorating, p=NS). Table 1: Characteristics of Solid Organ Transplant Recipients with COVID-19 Infection Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infections after vaccination are occurring in SOTR, including cases of critical illness, suggesting reduced vaccine effectiveness within this vulnerable population.

Blood products are precious resources especially in the African context and this has been especially compounded during the Covid-19 pandemic. Concurrent to this during the Covid-19 level 5 lockdown in South Africa from 26 March - 30 April 2020, a decrease in trauma admissions to state hospitals was noted. The aim of this data collection was to assess whether lowered blood product issuance was seen during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Method: Areas at Tygerberg Hospital with trauma patients were identified, namely: the A1W intensive care unit (Surgical ICU), Trauma Front Room (Trauma Admissions), Trauma Resuscitation unit (Trauma Resus Area) and J7(Trauma Ward). Data of blood product issuance (red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma) for these 4 areas was provided by the Western Cape Blood Service for the period 26 March-30 April 2018, 2019 and 2020. This included the stage 5 Covid-19 South African lockdown, as well as Easter for all three years which is traditionally associated with raised trauma admissions. This data was quantitative. Results: 201 products were issued in 2018 versus 103 for the same period in 2020 for the 4 trauma areas in Tygerberg Hospital. The surgical ICU received the most products over 3a?years with 183 of the product issuances. Discussion: As expected there was a significant decrease in blood product (red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma) issuance during the 2020 period which paralleled the lowered trauma numbers. This represented a significant cost saving of over R150 000 despite increased yearly costs for blood products over the same period.

CD38, a major mammalian NAD(+) glycohydrolase (NADase), expresses on T cells following activation and appears to be an essential modulator of intracellular NAD(+) levels. The enzymatic activity of CD38 in the process of generating the second messenger cADPR utilizes intracellular NAD(+,) and thus limits its availability to different NAD(+) consuming enzymes (PARP, ART, and sirtuins) inside the cells. The present review discusses how the CD38-NAD(+) axis affects T cell activation and differentiation through interfering with their signaling and metabolic processes.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study randomly selected health examinees who underwent health check-up at 16 health promotion centres in 13 Korean cities across the country between late September and early December 2020. Residual serum samples were obtained from 4085 subjects (2014 men and 2071 women). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Elecsys, Mannheim, Germany). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Fisher's exact test was used to compare the seroprevalence according to sex, age group and region. The relative risks of being seropositive according to the characteristics of the study subjects were analysed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 0.39% (95% CI=0.20% to 0.58%): 0.30% (95% CI=0.06% to 0.54%) for men and 0.48% (95% CI=0.18% to 0.78%) for women.

We present three numerical justifications for skip connections: as time discretisations in explicit schemes, as extrapolation mechanisms for accelerating those methods, and as recurrent connections in fixed point solvers for implicit schemes. Last but not least, we also motivate uncommon design choices such as nonmonotone activation functions. Our findings give a numerical perspective on the success of modern neural network architectures, and they provide design criteria for stable networks.","output":"Translating Numerical Concepts for PDEs into Neural Architectures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monte Carlo simulations and integral equation techniques allow for the flexible and efficient computation of drag and diffusion coefficients for virus mimetic particles.

Methods: The data were retrieved from an online panel of full-time employees (E- COCO- J). The analysis included participants who were employed and were not vaccinated at baseline (June 2021) but received vaccination at a four-month follow-up (October 2021). An 11-item scale measured the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. Four types of psychosocial working conditions (i.e., job demands, job control, and supervisor and coworker support) were measured using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between the psychosocial working conditions and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, adjusting for gender, age, educational attainment, marital status, occupation, chronic disease, dose of vaccination, anxiety from potential side effects of vaccines, fear and worry about COVID-19, and psychological distress at baseline. Results: Overall, 747 employees were included in the analysis. The average number of side effects was 3.78 (SD=2.19): Arm pain (81.1%), fatigues (64.1%), muscle pains (63.3%), and fever (37.5 degrees Celsius +) (53.5%) were reported more frequently. Coworker support score was significantly and negatively associated with the numbers of side effects (standardized {beta}=-0.122, p=0.017). Women, young age, second time vaccination, and high psychological distress were significantly associated with several side effects. Conclusions: Employees with low coworker support may be more likely to have side effects after COVID-19 vaccinations. The findings of this study could inform employees with low coworker support that increasing workplace support may reduce the side effects.","output":"The effect of job strain and worksite social support on reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccine: a prospective study of employees in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical features of the patients on HD with COVID-19 and determine the prognostic factors.

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study including all hospitalised patients 18 years with EWS recorded at hospitals in the Central Denmark Region during the year 2016. The primary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death within 2 days following an initial EWS. Prognostic accuracy was examined using sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV). Discriminative accuracy was examined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). RESULTS: Among 97 332 evaluated patients, 1714 (1.8%) experienced the primary outcome. The qSOFA 2 was less sensitive (11.7% (95% CI: 10.2% to 13.3%) vs 25.1% (95% CI: 23.1% to 27.3%)) and more specific (99.3% (95% CI: 99.2% to 99.3%) vs 97.5% (95% CI: 97.4% to 97.6%)) than EWS 5. The NPV was similar for the two scores (EWS 5, 98.6% (95% CI: 98.6% to 98.7%) and qSOFA 2, 98.4% (95% CI: 98.3% to 98.5%)), while the PPV was 15.1% (95% CI: 13.8% to 16.5%) for EWS 5 and 22.4% (95% CI: 19.7% to 25.3%) for qSOFA 2.

We aimed to explore the changes in ECG parameters after treatment with triple combination therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19. METHODS This retrospective, single-center case series analyzed 91 patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 at Ankara Gazi Mus-tafa Kemal State Hospital of Ankara City, Turkey, from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Forty-three patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine+oseltamivir+azithromycin (Group 1) and 48 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine+oseltamivir+levofloxacin (Group 2). Heart rate, P wave duration, P wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, corrected QT interval (QTc), QTc dispersion (QTD), delta QTc, Tp-e, Tp-e dispersion, and Tp-e/QTc ratio were all calculated from the baseline and posttreatment 12-lead ECG recordings. RESULTS The QTc, QRS duration, Tp-e, PR interval, and P wave duration were significantly increased after treatment (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p=0.001; p=0.001). The posttreatment C-reactive protein level was significantly lower than at baseline in Group 1 (p=0.014). At admission, 30% of patients had QT prolongation, and 4.3% of them had a QT duration >500 ms. Both Group 1 and Group 2 showed significant prolongation of the QTc interval (Group 1; p<0.001 vs. Group 2; p<0.001), QRS duration (Group 1; p=0.006 vs. Group 2; p=0.014), Tp-e (Group 1; p=0.036 vs. Group 2; p<0.001), and PR interval (Group 1; p=0.002 vs. Group2; p=0.05). The QTD was significantly decreased in Group 1 (p<0.001). None of the patients experienced any overt ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate QT prolongation in a population of COVID-19 patients treated with triple combination therapy.

Pad weighting tests have been recommended in the evaluation of post-radical prostatectomy urinary incontinence severity, being considered the 24HPT gold standard. Some authors consider that the longer the testing, the better assessment. We propose a self-filled pad weight, the 7DPT. METHODS A prospective study of incontinent male patients after radical prostatectomy. We carried out the study in two phases. All patients underwent urodynamic study. The first phase evaluated the feasibility and reliability of 7DPT. The second evaluated the correlation between 7DPT, 24HPT, and ICIQ-SF questionnaire in a larger sample. RESULTS First phase: 32 patients were recruited. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with good agreement between mean 7DPT and 24HPT. The number of pads and mean 7DPT showed a good correlation. Second phase: 72 patients were screened, 51 (71%) met inclusion criteria. Mean 7DPT and 24HPT showed a strong association. Mean 7DPT and 24HPT correlated moderately with ICIQ-SF score. 7DPT and 24HPT agreement with ICIQ-SF groups was slight. As 7DPT captures better days with maximum urinary leakage, up to 12 patients would have been misclassified according to 24HPT (number need to treat for 7DPT was seven).

We previously reported the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain BH10 by human IFITM1, 2 and 3. It is unknown whether other HIV-1 strains are similarly inhibited by IFITMs and whether there exists viral countermeasure to overcome IFITM inhibition. We report here that the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain (HIV-1(NL4-3)) is not restricted by IFITM1 and its viral envelope glycoprotein is partly responsible for this insensitivity. However, HIV-1(NL4-3) is profoundly inhibited by an IFITM1 mutant, known as (117C125), which is deleted of 9 amino acids at the C-terminus. In contrast to the wild type IFITM1, which does not affect HIV-1 entry, the (117C125) mutant diminishes HIV-1(NL4-3) entry by 3-fold. This inhibition correlates with the predominant localization of (117C125) to the plasma membrane where HIV-1 entry occurs. In spite of strong conservation of IFITM1 among most species, mouse IFITM1 is 19 amino acids shorter at its C-terminus as compared to human IFITM1 and, like the human IFITM1 mutant (117C125), mouse IFITM1 also inhibits HIV-1 entry. This is the first report illustrating the role of viral envelope protein in overcoming IFITM1 restriction.

A total of 1378 participants were tested across four study sites. ResultsCompared to standard of care RT-PCR testing, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the Atila iAMP test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were 76.2% and 94.9%, respectively, and increased to 88.8% and 89.5%, respectively, after exclusion of an outlier study site. Sensitivity varied based on the anatomic collected site. Sensitivity for nasopharyngeal was 65.4% (range across study sites:52.8%-79.8%), mid-turbinate 88.2%, saliva 55.1% (range across study sites:42.9%-77.8%) and anterior nares 66.7% (range across study sites:63.6%-76.5%).

Epidemiological studies have reported a drastic increase in mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and feelings of disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study is embedded within the larger CovSocial project which sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during the pandemic. The current second phase will investigate the efficacy of brief online mental training interventions in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing psychological resilience and social capacities. It further provides a unique opportunity for the prediction of intervention effects by individual biopsychosocial characteristics and preceding longitudinal change patterns during the pandemic in 2020/21. METHODS: We will examine the differential effects of a socio-emotional (including Affect Dyad) and a mindfulness-based (including Breathing Meditation) intervention, delivered through a web- and cellphone application. Participants will undergo 10 weeks of intervention, and will be compared to a retest control group. The effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated in a community sample (N = 300), which is recruited from the original longitudinal CovSocial sample. The pre- to post-intervention changes, potential underlying mechanisms, and prediction thereof, will be assessed on a wide range of outcomes: levels of stress, loneliness, depression and anxiety, resilience, prosocial behavior, empathy, compassion, and the impact on neuroendocrine, immunological and epigenetic markers. The multi-method nature of the study will incorporate self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches, and biological, hormonal and epigenetic markers assessed in saliva.

All crew members were followed up for a minimum of 10 weeks, regardless of test results or the absence of symptoms. RESULTS: The crew was predominantly young (mean age, 27 years) and was in general good health, meeting U.S. Navy standards for sea duty. Over the course of the outbreak, 1271 crew members (26.6% of the crew) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by rRT-PCR testing, and more than 1000 infections were identified within 5 weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed infection. An additional 60 crew members had suspected Covid-19 (i.e., illness that met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists clinical criteria for Covid-19 without a positive test result). Among the crew members with laboratory-confirmed infection, 76.9% (978 of 1271) had no symptoms at the time that they tested positive and 55.0% had symptoms develop at any time during the clinical course.

Dhaka, Bangladesh was chosen as the research area of this study, as Bangladesh is a developing country with pollution; moreover, the level of residents environmental perception was assessed, and their environmental attitudes and awareness were examined in relation to their demographic characteristics. A face-to-face questionnaire survey involving 400 respondents was conducted across various zones of the study area. The mean score, standard deviation, and p value of each respondents answer were calculated separately using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Then, a grand mean, average standard deviation, and combined p values for environmental perception and attitude themes were computed theme-wise. Descriptive statistics were produced to illustrate the respondents level of environmental awareness. The study results revealed that the respondents had a moderate to high level of perceived knowledge about the causes and effects of environmental pollution. They also had an intention to reduce the environmental pollution in their surroundings. The score differences (p < .05) across the age groups, education levels, occupation types, and income groups were nearly all significant, except for those pertaining to the gender of the respondents.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives are to evaluate the implementation of community-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) and its effectiveness on cognition, gait, and balance in healthy older adults. METHODS: A single-blind randomized controlled trial with baseline and follow-up assessments was conducted at two community centers in Singapore. Healthy community-dwelling adults aged 55 years and older participated in a 10-week CCT program with 2-hour instructor-led group classes twice a week. Participants used a mobile app to play games targeting attention, memory, decision making, visuospatial abilities, and cognitive flexibility. Implementation was assessed at the participant, provider, and community level (eg, reach, implementation, and facilitators and barriers). Effectiveness measures were the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Color Trails Test 2 (CTT-2), Berg Balance Scale, and GAITRite walkway measures (single and dual task gait speed, dual task cost, and single and dual task gait variability index [GVI]). RESULTS: A total of 94 healthy community-dwelling adults participated in the CCT program (mean age 68.8 [SD 6.3] years). Implementation measures revealed high reach (125/155, 80.6%) and moderate adherence but poor penetration of sedentary older adults (43/125, 34.4%). The effectiveness data were based on intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis. In the ITT analysis, single task GVI increased (b=2.32, P=.02, 95% CI [0.30 to 4.35]) and RBANS list recognition subtest deteriorated (b=C0.57, P=.01, 95% CI [C1.00 to C0.14]) in both groups. In the PP analysis, time taken to complete CTT-2 (b=C13.5, P=.01, 95% CI [C23.95 to C3.14]; Cohen d effect size = 0.285) was faster in the intervention group. Single task gait speed was not statistically significantly maintained in the intervention group (b=5.38, P=.06, 95% CI [C0.30 to 11.36]) and declined in the control group (Cohen d effect size = 0.414). PP analyses also showed interaction terms for RBANS list recall subtest (b=C0.36, P=.08, 95% CI [C0.75 to 0.04]) and visuospatial domain (b=0.46, P=.08, 95% CI [C0.05 to 0.96]) that were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: CCT can be implemented in community settings to improve attention and executive function among healthy older adults.

Trauma by inducing inflammation and activating proteolytic pathways may potentiate the effects of mechanical ventilation on the diaphragm. In a blunt chest trauma with concomitant injuries we tested the hypothesis that trauma via inflammation further activates the proteolytic pathways and worsens atrophy in the diaphragm. MATERIAL AND METHODS Piglets were separated into 2 groups and underwent 72hrs of mechanical ventilation. One group received a polytrauma (PT) by unilateral femur fracture, blunt chest trauma with lung contusion, laparotomy with standardized liver incision and a predefined haemorrhagic shock. The second mechanically ventilated group (MV) did not receive any trauma. A non-ventilated group (Con) served as control.Diaphragmatic fibre dimensions, Western Blot analyses of proteolytic pathways and lipid peroxidation and mRNA levels of cytokines and NFkB subunit p65 were measured. RESULTS Active Caspase-3 was significantly increased in MV (p = 0.019), and in PT (p = 0.02) compared to Con. NFkB subunit p65, was up-regulated in PT (p = 0.010) compared to Con. IL-6 mRNA increased significantly in PT compared to Con (p = 0.0024) but did not differ between Con and MV. CONCLUSION Trauma and mechanical ventilation induced proteolysis and atrophy in the diaphragm, but only polytrauma induced an inflammatory response in the diaphragm. The additional traumatic inflammatory stimulus did not increase the levels of the pre-mentioned variables. These data underline that inflammation is not a major contributor to VIDD.

Age-related changes in muscle mass and body composition along with medical comorbidities including stroke, dementia, and depression place elderly adults at high risk for developing malnutrition and frailty. This loss of function and decline in muscle mass (ie, sarcopenia) can be associated with reduced mobility and ability to perform the task of daily living, placing the elderly at an increased risk for falls, fractures, and subsequent institutionalization, leading to a decline in the quality of life and increased mortality. There are a number of modifiable factors that can mitigate some of the muscle loss elderly experience especially when hospitalized. Due to this, it is paramount for providers to understand the pathophysiology behind malnutrition and sarcopenia, be able to assess risk factors for malnutrition, and provide appropriate nutrition support.

In this study, we designed a novel multi-antigen subunit vaccine which can induce innate, humoral and cellular immune responses. Alpha hemolysin, enterotoxins A and B were selected as protective antigens for combining into a triple antigen chimeric protein (HAB). Immunoinformatics analysis predicted HAB protein as a suitable vaccine candidate for inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. Tertiary structure of the HAB protein was predicted and validated through computational approaches. Docking studies were performed between the HAB protein and mice TLR2 receptor. Furthermore, we constructed and generated recombinant HAB (r-HAB) protein in E. coli and studied its toxicity, immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a mouse model. Triple antigen chimeric protein (r-HAB) was found to be highly immunogenic in mouse as the anti-r-HAB hyperimmune serum was strongly reactive to all three native exotoxins on Western blot. In vitro toxin neutralization assay using anti-r-HAB antibodies demonstrated > 75% neutralization of toxins on RAW 264.7 cell line. Active immunization with r-HAB toxoid gave ~ 83% protection against 2  lethal dosage of secreted exotoxins. The protection was mediated by induction of strong antibody responses that neutralized the toxins. Passive immunization with anti-r-HAB antibodies gave ~ 50% protection from lethal challenge. In conclusion, in vitro and in vivo testing of r-HAB found the molecule to be nontoxic, highly immunogenic and induced excellent protection towards native toxins in actively immunized and partial protection to passively immunized mice groups.

We also seek to understand the association of temperature and geographic coordinates with viral genomics. Epidemiological data along with temperature, latitude, longitude, and preparedness index were collected for different countries and US states during the early stages of the pandemic. Our worldwide epidemiological analysis showed a significant correlation between temperature and incidence, mortality, recovery cases and active cases. The same tendency was found with latitude, but not with longitude. In the US, we observed no correlation between temperature or latitude and epidemiological variables. Interestingly, longitude was correlated with incidence, mortality, active cases, and hospitalization. An analysis of mutational change and mutational change per time in 55 453 aligned SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed these parameters were uncorrelated with temperature and geographic coordinates. The epidemiological trends we observed worldwide suggest a seasonal effect for the disease that is not directly controlled by the genomic makeup of the virus.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data obtained from the review of medical charts of all consecutive patients treated with CERAB technique for AIOD between January 2016 and December 2019 in San Giovanni-Addolorata Hospital (Rome, Italy). Clinical examination, duplex ultrasound with ankle-brachial index measurement and contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography were performed preoperatively. A clinical and ultrasound follow-up was carried out at one month and then half yearly after the intervention to evaluate patients' clinical status, limb salvage, target lesion revascularization rate, primary and secondary patency rate. RESULTS: During the study period, 24 patients (14 men, 58.3%; 10 women, 41.7%; median age 59 years, range 37-79 years) underwent CERAB for AIOD (TASC II C 29.2%, TASC II D 70.8%). Indications for treatment were: intermittent claudication in 18 patients (75%) and critical limb ischemia in 6 (25%). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Perioperative minor complications occurred in three cases (12.5%). One patient reported an intraoperative iliac rupture requiring adjunctive covered stenting. Median hospital length of stay was two days (range 1-9). No patient died perioperatively nor at the last follow-up. At a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-48 months), mean ankle-brachial index increased significantly (from 0.62  0.15 before the procedure to 0.84  0.18) (P < 0.001) and target lesion revascularization rate was 12.5%. At two years, the limb salvage rate was 100%, and primary and secondary patency rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively.

There is no correlation of vaccination percentage and Gini coefficient and the correlation with GDP is decreasing in time. The most striking is the comparison of Eastern European and South American countries; the latter group of countries shows significantly higher vaccination percentage while having a lower or comparable GDP and higher Gini coefficient. The analysis suggests that timely and reliable information about the COVID-19 cases and the associated deaths plays a key role in achieving population-wide vaccine acceptance.","output":"Vaccine hesitancy strongly correlates with COVID-19 deaths underreporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), also known as porcine coronavirus HKU15, was reported in China in 2012 and identified in the U.S. in early 2014. Since then, PDCoV has been identified in a number of U.S. states and linked with clinical disease including acute diarrhea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable pathogens. Since PDCoV was just recently linked with clinical disease, few specific antibody-based reagents were available to assist in diagnosis of PDCoV and limited serological capabilities were available to detect an antibody response to this virus. Therefore, the overall objective of this project was to develop and validate selected diagnostic reagents and assays for PDCoV antigen and antibody detection. RESULTS: The nucleoprotein of PDCoV was expressed as a recombinant protein and purified for use as an antigen to immunize mice for polyclonal, hyperimmune sera and monoclonal antibody (mAb) production. The resulting mAbs were evaluated for use in fluorescent antibody staining methods to detect PDCoV infected cells following virus isolation attempts and for immunohistochemistry staining of intestinal tissues of infected pigs. The same antigen was used to develop serological tests to detect the antibody response to PDCoV in pigs following infection. Serum samples from swine herds with recent documentation of PDCoV infection and samples from expected na?ve herds were used for initial assay optimization. The tests were optimized in a checkerboard fashion to reduce signal to noise ratios using samples of known status. Statistical analysis was performed to establish assay cutoff values and assess diagnostic sensitivities and specificities. At least 629 known negative serum samples and 311 known positive samples were evaluated for each assay. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 96.1 % and diagnostic specificity (DSp) of 96.2 %. The fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) showed a DSe of 95.8 % and DSp of 98.1 %. Both ELISA and FMIA detected seroconversion of challenged pigs between 8C14 days post-infection (DPI). An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test was also developed using cell culture adapted PDCoV for comparative purposes. CONCLUSION: These new, specific reagents and serological assays will allow for improved diagnosis of PDCoV. Since many aspects of PDCoV infection and transmission are still not fully understood, the reagents and assays developed in this project should provide valuable tools to help understand this disease and to aid in the control and surveillance of porcine deltacoronavirus outbreaks.","output":"Development of monoclonal antibodies and serological assays including indirect ELISA and fluorescent microsphere immunoassays for diagnosis of porcine deltacoronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies reported that COVID-19 patients with cancer had higher rates of severe events such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (MV) assistance, and death during the COVID-19 course compared to the general population.

Thus, in this study, we intend to reveal the outcome of COVID-19 in hematologic cancer patients and compare their outcomes with COVID-19 patients with solid cancers. The data of 926 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, including 463 hematologic cancer patients and an age-gender paired cohort of 463 solid cancer patients, were investigated retrospectively. The frequencies of severe and critical disease, hospital and ICU admission, MV assistance were significantly higher in hematologic cancer patients compared with the solid cancer patients (p = 0.001, p = 0.045, p = 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). The hospital stay was longer in patients with hematologic cancers (p = 0.001); however, the median ICU stay was 6 days in both groups. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 14.9% in patients with hematologic cancers, and it was 4.8% in patients with solid cancers, and there was a statistically significant difference regarding CFR between groups (p = 0.001). Our study revealed that COVID-19 patients with hematologic cancers have a more aggressive course of COVID-19 and have higher CFR compared to COVID-19 patients with solid cancers and support the increased susceptibility of patients with hematologic cancers during the outbreak.","output":"Patients with hematologic cancers are more vulnerable to COVID-19 compared to patients with solid cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The heme oxygenase (HO) system is believed to be a crucial mechanism for the nervous system under stress conditions.

The first identified isoform of the HO system, HO-1, is an inducible protein that is highly expressed in peripheral organs and barely detectable in the brain under normal conditions, whereas HO-2 is a constitutive protein that is highly expressed in the brain. Several lines of evidence indicate that HO-1 dysregulation is associated with brain inflammation and neurodegeneration, including Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases. In this review, we summarize the essential roles that the HO system plays in ensuring brain health and the molecular mechanism through which HO-1 dysfunction leads to neurodegenerative diseases and disruption of nervous system homeostasis.

The University of British Columbia (UBC) MD Undergraduate Program (MDUP) is the sixth largest medical school in North America. MDUP students and faculty developed a joint response to these disruptions to address the curriculum and public health challenges that the pandemic posed. After clinical activities were suspended in March 2020, third- and fourth-year MDUP students formed a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team (MSRT) to support frontline physicians, public health agencies, and community members affected by the pandemic. A nimble organizational structure was developed across 4 UBC campuses to ensure a rapid response to meet physician and community needs. Support from the faculty ensured the activities were safe for the public, patients, and students and facilitated the provision of curricular credit for volunteer activities meeting academic criteria. As of June 19, 2020, more than 700 medical students had signed up to participate in 68 projects. The majority of students participated in projects supporting the health care system, including performing contact tracing, staffing public COVID-19 call centers, distributing personal protective equipment, and creating educational multimedia products. Many initiatives have been integrated into the MDUP curriculum as scholarly activities or paraclinical electives for which academic credit is awarded. This was made possible by the inherent flexibility of the MDUP curriculum and a strong existing partnership between students and faculty. Through this process, medical students were able to develop fundamental leadership, advocacy, communication, and collaboration skills, essential competencies for graduating physicians. In developing a transparent, accountable, and inclusive organization, students were able to effectively meet community needs during a crisis and create a sustainable and democratic structure capable of responding to future emergencies.

However, a rise in COPD hospitalisations may indicate a considerable increase in fatality rate in public health. The current study focuses on the association between consecutive ambient air pollution (CAAP) and COPD hospitalisation to offer predictable early guidance towards estimates of COPD hospital admissions in the event of consecutive exposure to air pollution. Big data analytics were collected from 3-year time series recordings (from 2015 to 2017) of both air data and COPD hospitalisation data in the Chengdu region in China. Based on the combined effects of CAAP and unit increase in air pollutant concentrations, a quasi-Poisson regression model was established, which revealed the association between CAAP and estimated COPD admissions. The results show the dynamics and outbreaks in the variations in COPD admissions in response to CAAP. Cross-validation and mean squared error (MSE) are applied to validate the goodness of fit. In both short-term and long-term air pollution exposures, Z test outcomes show that the COPD hospitalisation risk is greater for men than for women; similarly, the occurrence of COPD hospital admissions in the group of elderly people (> 65 years old) is significantly larger than that in lower age groups. The time lag between the air quality and COPD hospitalisation is also investigated, and a peak of COPD hospitalisation risk is found to lag 2 days for air quality index (AQI) and PM10, and 1 day for PM2.5. The big data-based predictive paradigm would be a measure for the early detection of a public health event in post-COVID-19.

The possible role that children attending primary school may play in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To gain a better understanding of the possible role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study was conducted from September 21 to December 31, 2020, in a primary school in Lige, Belgium, among a volunteer sample of 181 children, parents, and school employees. EXPOSURES: Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection once a week for 15 weeks through throat washing, performed with 5 mL of saline and collected in a sterile tube after approximately 30 seconds of gargling. Quantitative reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In case of test positivity, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire aimed at determining the timing of symptom onset and symptom duration. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequencing was also performed. Confirmed cases were linked based on available information on known contacts and viral sequences. RESULTS: A total of 181 individuals participated in this study, including 63 children (34 girls [54.0%]; mean [SD] age, 8.6 [1.9] years [range, 5-13 years]) and 118 adults (75 women [63.6%]; mean [SD] age, 42.5 [5.7] years [range, 30-59 years]). Forty-five individuals (24.9%) tested positive: 13 children (20.6%; 95% CI, 10.6%-30.6%) and 32 adults (27.1%; 95% CI, 19.1%-35.7%) (P = .34). Children were more often asymptomatic compared with adults (6 [46.2%; 95% CI, 19.1%-73.3%] vs 4 of 31 [12.9%; 95% CI, 1.3%-24.5%]; P = .04). The median duration of symptoms was shorter in children than in adults (0.00 days [IQR, 0.00-1.00 days] vs 15.00 days [IQR, 7.00-22.00 days]). A reconstruction of the outbreak revealed that most transmission events occurred between teachers and between children within the school. Of the observed household transmission events, most seemed to have originated from a child or teacher who acquired the infection at school. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the implementation of several mitigation measures, the incidence of COVID-19 among children attending primary school in this study was comparable to that observed among teachers and parents. Transmission tree reconstruction suggests that most transmission events originated from within the school. Additional measures should be considered to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at school, including intensified testing.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 After COVID-19 Screening and Mitigation Measures for Primary School Children Attending School in Lige, Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are readily incorporated into the synthesis pathways of A. baumannii membrane phospholipids, where they contribute to reduced bacterial fitness and increased antimicrobial susceptibility. Here we examine the impact of PUFA membrane modification on membrane organisation and biophysical properties using coarse grained MARTINI simulations of chemically representative membrane models developed from mass-spectrometry datasets of an untreated, arachidonic acid (AA) treated and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treated A. baumannii membranes. Enzymatic integration of AA or DHA into phospholipids of the A. baumannii membrane resulted in modulation of membrane biophysical properties. Membrane thickness decreased slightly following PUFA treatment, concomitant with changes in the lateral area per lipid of each lipid headgroup class. PUFA treatment resulted in a decrease in membrane ordering and an increase in lipid lateral diffusion. Changes in lateral membrane organisation were observed in the PUFA treated membranes, with a concurrent increase in ordered cardiolipin domains and disordered PUFA containing domains. Notably, separation between ordered and disordered domains was enhanced and was more pronounced for DHA relative to AA, providing a possible mechanism for greater antimicrobial action of DHA relative to AA observed experimentally. Furthermore, the membrane active antimicrobial, pentamidine, preferentially adsorbs to cardiolipin domains of the A. baumannii model membranes. This interaction, and membrane penetration of pentamidine, was enhanced following PUFA treatment. Cumulatively, this work explores the wide-ranging effects of PUFA incorporation on the A. baumannii membrane and provides a molecular basis for bacterial inner membrane disruption by PUFAs.","output":"Dynamics of the Acinetobacter baumannii inner membrane under exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease infection (COVID-19) outbreak that was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 had led to an internationally variable but concerning incidence of COVID-associated acute kidney injury (AKI), with prevalence reported as high as 46% in large cohorts of hospitalized patients.

The palette of action of these forces ranges from mechanical pressures on organ primordia at the microscopic level up to the twisting of a peduncle that promotes resupination of a flower at the macroscopic level. Here, we argue that without these forces acting during the ontogenetic process, the actual flower phenotype would not be achieved as it is. In this review, we concentrate on mechanical forces that occur at the microscopic level and determine the fate of the flower shape by the physical constraints on meristems at an early stage of development.

However, there is a need to develop behavioral strategies that can effectively increase adherence to these guidelines, especially for young adults, who report particularly poor adherence. Across several domains of prevention science, norms-based interventions have successfully motivated constructive health behavior by correcting normative misperceptions, but these strategies are only relevant when these misperceptions are widespread. We examined the accuracy of young adults' perceptions of peers' adherence to CDC-recommended behavioral guidelines (i.e., perceived social norms) to assess the rationale for employing norm-correcting strategies. Young adult college students (N = 539; Mage = 19.5 years) self-reported their level of adherence to a list of preventive behavioral guidelines and estimated the norms regarding the extent to which other young adults adhered to these guidelines. We measured adherence and perceived norms for each guideline in terms of adherence frequency, ranging from 0 to 100% of the time. We found that young adults, on average, underestimated the extent to which other young adults adhere to each of the recommended preventive behaviors. That is, young adults tended to think that other young adults are failing to adhere to CDC guidelines, whereas our self-reported data showed adherence frequency may be quite high. Moreover, we found positive associations between self-reported adherence and perceptions of others' adherence-that is, those who underestimated others' adherence also self-reported lower adherence to guidelines. Findings from this study establish proof-of-concept for the development of norms-based strategies designed to improve young adults' adherence to preventive behavioral guidelines that are both specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and that prepare for future contagious outbreaks.","output":"Young Adults Underestimate How Well Peers Adhere to COVID-19 Preventive Behavioral Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The organoselenium compound ebselen has recently been investigated as a treatment for COVID-19, however&lt;br&gt;efforts to model ebselen in silico have been hampered by the lack of a efficient and accurate method to assess&lt;br&gt;its binding to biological macromolecules.

Despite all benefits, there might be some threats for younger groups spending their time in quarantine. This study aims to determine the impacts of lockdown and school closure on children's major lifestyle aspects, especially their leisure and sleep pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, an online questionnaire was distributed from 14th to 31st of March 2020 among the schools and students from the first grade to the 12th grade (before university) in Fars province, southern Iran. The questionnaire consisted of five sections which included data regarding the students' general information, activity priorities, adherence to quarantine, attitude toward school closure, and sleep patterns. RESULTS: In our study, 20,697 filled questionnaires were received from the participants with an average age of 13.76 years; 29.7% of them were male, 80.6% were from urban areas, and 83.3% were from public schools. The overall first preference of students during school closure was mobile and computer games (30.1%), followed by studying (26.6%) and watching television (13.8%). Our results demonstrated that the majority of students adhered to social distancing and there was also a significant correlation among education levels and desire for schools to be closed till the end of the semester (P = 0.015). Also, regarding sleep patterns, the majority (53.5%) had above 12 h of sleep throughout the day. CONCLUSION: It seems that lockdown following COVID-19 pandemic has changed various aspects of the students' lifestyle remarkably, especially by increasing screen time and even sleep duration and pattern. We believe that certain strategies should be implemented by the Health and Educational Ministry to control not only the visible side effects of the quarantine period, but also the collateral consequences on their psychological and mental health.","output":"Students' attitude and sleep pattern during school closure following COVID-19 pandemic quarantine: a web-based survey in south of Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has pushed the medical system to its breaking point.

However, little is known about outcomes in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed between 2002 and 2019 for all adult patients undergoing isolated mitral valve (MV) surgery. Patients with PH (mean pulmonary artery pressure &#8805; 25 mmHg) were stratified by FS or MIMVS and nearest-neighbor propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 591 surgeries (317 MIMVS, 274 FS) met inclusion criteria during the study period. Nearest neighbor propensity matching generated 112 well-matched pairs. Cardiopulmonary bypass (137 vs 89.5 min, P < 0.001), cross clamp (102 vs 63 min, P < 0.001), and total operative times (241 vs. 178.5 min, p < 0.001) were longer for the MIMVS group.

According to meta-analysis data, 9.8C20% of COVID-19 patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, where diarrhoea is the most frequent, and about 50% shed viruses with high titre through their faeces, where a first faecal transmission was reported. Furthermore, gut inflammation, intestinal damage, and weakening of the gut mucosal integrity that leads to increased permeability has been shown in different studies for COVID-19 patients. This can lead to increased inflammation and bacteraemia. Low mucosal integrity combined with low intestinal damage is a good predictor for disease progression and submission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Several pilot studies have shown that the gut microbiome of COVID-19 patients is changed, microbial richness and diversity were lower, and opportunistic pathogens that can cause bacteraemia were enriched compared to a healthy control group. In a large proportion of these patients, dysbiosis was not resolved at discharge from the hospital and one study showed dysbiosis is still present after 3 months post COVID-19. Consequently, there might be a link between dysbiosis of the gut microbiome in COVID-19 patients and chronic COVID-19 syndrome (CCS).

The majority of respondents were female (83%), and the most common age group was 31 to 40ayears (52.2%). Nurses constituted 86.3% of the respondents. HCWs reported higher anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic which increased from 4.91aa2.84 to 8.6aa2.27 on an 11-point Likert scale compared to other viral outbreaks. HCWs believed that their own preparedness as well as that of their hospital's intensive care unit or emergency room was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic (2012-2015). About 58% of HCWs attended one or more simulations concerning the management of COVID-19 patients in their intensive care unit/emergency room, and nearly all had undergone N95 mask fit testing.

In human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), synergistic mutations in its protease and the protease substrate C the Group-specific antigen (Gag) polyprotein C work together to confer drug resistance against protease inhibitors and compensate the mutations affecting viral fitness. Some Gag mutations can restore Gag-protease binding, yet most Gag-protease correlated mutations occur outside of the Gag cleavage site. To investigate the molecular basis for this, we now report multiscale modelling approaches to investigate various sequentially cleaved Gag products in the context of clinically relevant mutations that occur outside of the cleavage sites, including simulations of the largest Gag proteolytic product in its viral membrane-bound state. We found that some mutations, such as G123E and H219Q, involve direct interaction with cleavage site residues to influence their local environment, while certain mutations in the matrix domain lead to the enrichment of lipids important for Gag targeting and assembly. Collectively, our results reveal why non-cleavage site mutations have far-reaching implications outside of Gag proteolysis, with important consequences for drugging Gag maturation intermediates and tackling protease inhibitor resistance.","output":"The impact of Gag non-cleavage site mutations on HIV-1 viral fitness from integrative modelling and simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Beginning in December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a pneumonia epidemic that began in Wuhan, China, and is rapidly spreading throughout the whole world.

Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition, which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19, the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure. METHODS: High-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients. Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission. In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied. If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided. If <2 bottles/d of ONS are consumed for 2 consecutive days and/or respiratory conditions are worsening, supplemental/total parenteral nutrition is prescribed. CONCLUSION: We are aware that our straight approach may be debatable. However, to cope with the current emergency crisis, its aim is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in patients with COVID-19, which might be overlooked despite being potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population.","output":"Early nutritional supplementation in non-critically ill patients hospitalized for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Rationale and feasibility of a shared pragmatic protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seeking to examine the implications of social distancing, isolation and the silencing of public spaces brought about by the COVID-19 epidemic, I offer an interpretation of Kafkas short story The Silence of the Sirens contrasting it to the Homeric original.

By contrast, in Kafkas telling of the story, the Sirens fall silent. A solitary Odysseus, indifferent to them, sails by peacefully, his ears blocked, his great eyes staring in the distance.

Kafkas character, by contrast, proposes a different archetype, one akin to the Stoics homo viator, the individual who sails through lifes adversities by accepting them and turning them into a source of inner strength and wisdom. In this way, Kafka offers two things: first, an insightful explanation of why silence and isolation can be deadly when they leaving us alone with our darkest fears and fantasies, and second, an archetype of hope that is attuned to our times on how to cope with pain and anxiety.","output":"Kafka and the COVID-19 epidemic: Why the Sirens silence is more deadly than their song"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Live vaccines are attractive vehicles for antigen delivery as a strategy to immunize against heterologous pathogens. The live vaccine MTBVAC is based on rational attenuation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with the objective of improving BCG protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. However, the development of recombinant mycobacteria as antigen-presenting microorganisms has been hindered due to their fastidious genetic manipulation. In this study, we used MTBVAC as a genetic platform to deliver diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis toxoids, which are the immunogenic constituents of the DTP vaccine. When using nonoptimal genetic conditions, the expression of these immunogens was barely detectable. Accordingly, we pursued a rational, step-by-step optimization of the genetic components to achieve the expression and secretion of these toxoids. We explored variants of the L5 mycobacteriophage promoter to ensure balanced antigen expression and plasmid stability. Optimal signal sequences were identified by comparative proteomics of MTBVAC and its parental strain. It was determined that proteins secreted by the Twin Arginine Translocation pathway displayed higher secretion in MTBVAC, and the Ag85A secretion sequence was selected as the best candidate. Because the coding regions of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis toxoids significantly differ in G + C content relative to mycobacterial genes, their codon usage was optimized. We also placed a 3xFLAG epitope in frame with the C-terminus of these toxoids to facilitate protein detection. Altogether, these optimizations resulted in the secretion of DTP antigens by MTBVAC, as demonstrated by western blot and MRM-MS.

We suggested taking time-varying SIR models with unreported infection rates (UIR)to estimate the factual COVID-19 cases in the United States.MethodsSIR integrated with unreported infection rates (SIRu) of fixed time effect and SIR with time-varying parameters (tvSIRu)were applied to estimate and compare the value of transmission rate(TR), UIR, and infection fatality rate (IFR) based on US county-level COVID-19 data. ResultsBased on US county-level COVID-19 data from January 22 (T 1 ) to August 20 (T 212 ) in 2020, SIRu was first tested and verified by a general OLS regression. The further regression of SIRu at the country-level showed that the average values of TR, UIR, and IFR were 0.034,19.5, 0.51% respectively. The range of TR, UIR, IFR of all states ranged were 0.007-0.157 (mean=0.048) ,7.31-185.6 (mean=38.89), and 0.04%-2.22% (mean=0.22%). Among time-varying transmission rate equations, the power function showed better fitness, which indicated a decline in TR decreasing from 227.58 (T 1 ) to 0.022 (T 212 ). The general equation of tvSIRu showed that both the UIR and IFR were gradually increasing, wherein, the UIR has an estimate of 9.1(95%CI = 5.7-14.0), and IFR was 0.70% (0.52%-0.95%) at T 212 .InterpretationDespite the decline in TR and IFR, the UIR of the United States is still on the rise, which had been supposed to decrease with sufficient tests or improved countersues.

Different countries have since enforced varying levels of lockdowns and guidelines for their populations to follow in a serious effort to mitigate the spread. Up until recently, the majority of these regulations and policies were established on the assumption that the dominant routes of transmission of this virus are through droplets and fomite contact. However, there is now a substantial amount of research pointing towards the strong possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can spread through airborne means. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently recognized this, which poses the question of whether our collective methods of lessening transmission risk and keeping people safe have been sufficient. This paper is a comprehensive review of the evidence on SARS-CoV-2 being an airborne disease, through different epidemiological, experimental, and animal-model based published research. Studies opposing this evidence have also been discussed. The majority of these studies are favoring the high plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission, and therefore the many implications of aerosol transmission have been discussed in this paper to suggest effective mitigation and control strategies.","output":"Clearing the air about airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can affect several organs, including the brain. In the brain, specifically, viral infection can cause dyshomeostasis of some trace elements that promote complex biochemical reactions in specialized neurological functions. OBJECTIVE: Understand the neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 and the relationship between trace elements and neurological disorders after infection, and provide new insights on the drug development for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: The main databases were used to search studies published up September 2021, focusing on the role of trace elements during viral infection and on the correct functioning of the brain. RESULTS: The imbalance of important trace elements can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 neurovirulence and increase the neurotoxicity since many neurological processes can be associated with the homeostasis of metal and metalloproteins. Some studies involving animals and humans have suggested the synapse as a vulnerable region of the brain to neurological disorders after viral infection. Considering the combined evidence, some mechanisms have been suggested to understand the relationship between neurological disorders and imbalance of trace elements in the brain after viral infection. CONCLUSION: Trace elements play important roles in viral infections, such as helping to activate immune cells, produce antibodies, and inhibit virus replication. However, the relationship between trace elements and virus infections is complex since the specific functions of several elements remain largely undefined. Therefore, there is still a lot to be explored to understand the biochemical mechanisms involved between trace elements and viral infections, especially in the brain.","output":"Trace element homeostasis in the neurological system after SARS-CoV-2 infection: Insight into potential biochemical mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intestinal epithelium is a major site of interaction with pathogens. In bovine intestinal epithelial cells (BIECs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in innate immune responses against enteric pathogens. This study is aimed at establishing a stable bovine intestinal epithelial cell line that can be maintained by a continuous passage so that studies on innate immune responses against various enteric pathogens can be performed. The main goal was to establish pure cultures of primary and immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cells from the ileum and then characterize them biochemically and immunologically. Mixed epithelial and fibroblast bovine ileal intestinal cultures were first established from a 2-day old calf. Limiting dilution method was used to obtain a clone of epithelial cells which was characterized using immunocytochemistry (ICC). The selected clone BIEC-c4 was cytokeratin positive and expressed low levels of vimentin, confirming the epithelial cell phenotype. Early passage BIEC-c4 cells were transfected with either simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen or human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), or human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16E6/E7 genes to establish three immortalized BIEC cell lines. The expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6/E7 genes in immortalized BIECs was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence assays also confirmed the expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6 proteins. The immortalized BIECs were cytokeratin positive and all except HPV-BIECs expressed low levels of vimentin. A growth kinetics study indicated that there were no significant differences in the doubling time of immortalized BIECs as compared to early passage BIEC-c4 cells. All four BIEC types expressed TLR 1-10 genes, with TLR 3 and 4 showing higher expression across all cell types. These newly established early passage and immortalized BIEC cell lines should serve as a good model for studying infectivity, pathogenesis and innate immune responses against enteric pathogens.","output":"Development and biochemical and immunological characterization of early passage and immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cell lines from the ileum of a young calf"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health endorsements during the present COVID-19 pandemic has led the governments of largely affected countries to imply policies that restrict social mobility to slow COVID-19 spread.

The degree to which each element contributes to the improvement of upper limb function remains unclear. It has been suggested that low-frequency rTMS applied to a healthy cerebrum activates neural activity in the contralateral hemispheric area surrounding the lesion. Intensive OT performed in parallel to rTMS promotes the functional remodeling of the cerebrum to help with rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES: However, this has not been demonstrated using NEURO?. Therefore, we aimed to compare the effects of the NEURO? and OT-only protocols in patients with hemiparesis following stroke. Methods: Thirty-seven patients with upper limb paralysis following stroke were recruited and hospitalized for treatments and randomly divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 16 patients who underwent NEURO? for the first 2 weeks, and Group B consisted of 21 patients who underwent OT-only for the first 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of hospitalization, the treatments of Groups A and B were reversed for the subsequent 2 weeks of treatment. Improvement in upper limb motor function in Groups A and B at 2 and 4 weeks after the start of treatment was evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA) and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). Results: Group A, who underwent NEURO? first during their initial 2-week hospitalization, showed significantly greater improvement than that in Group B, who underwent OT-only first (P = .041 for FMA and P < .01 for WMFT).

AdC68-19S is an investigational chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68) vector-based vaccine which encodes the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity, biodistribution and safety profiles of the candidate vaccine AdC68-19S in Sprague Dawley (SD) rat and rhesus macaque under GLP conditions. To characterize the biodistribution profile of AdC68-19S, SD rats were given a single intramuscular injection of AdC68-19S 2  10(11) VP/dose. Designated organs were collected on day 1, day 2, day 4, day 8 and day 15. Genomic DNA was extracted from all samples and was further quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). To characterize the toxicology and immunogenicity profiles of AdC68-19S, the rats and rhesus macaques were injected intramuscularly with AdC68-19S up to 2  10(11)vp/dose or 4  10(11)vp/dose (2 and fourfold the proposed clinical dose of 1  10(11)vp/dose) on two or three occasions with a 14-day interval period, respectively.

MethodsUsing an electronic laboratory information system, employees were divided into three groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2 naive and unvaccinated, (2) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) vaccinated. Person-days were measured from the date of the employee first test and truncated at the end of the observation period. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as two positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in a 30-day period. Individuals with fewer than 14 days of follow up were excluded. Incidence estimates and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson Exact equation. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used as a measure of association between groups. Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station, TX). ResultsWe identified 4313, 254 and 739 employee records for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

However, limited data exist on systemic O(2) utilization. The objective of this study was to examine systemic O(2) utilization in a case series of patients with this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 24, and April 9, 2020, 8 patients intubated for severe COVID-19 respiratory failure had near-simultaneous drawing of arterial blood gas (ABG), central venous blood gas (cVBG), and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) at a mean of 6.1 days into hospitalization. Three patients were managed with indirect cardiac output (CO) monitoring by FloTrac sensor and Vigileo monitor (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). The oxygen extraction index (OEI; SaO(2)-ScvO(2)/SaO(2)) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF; CaO(2)-CvO(2)/CaO(2)  100) were calculated. Values for hyperoxia (ScvO(2)  90%), normoxia (ScvO(2) 71C89%), and hypoxia (ScvO(2)  70%) were based on the literature. Mean values were calculated. RESULTS: The mean partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) was 102 with a mean fraction of inspired O(2) (FiO(2)) of 44%. One patient was hyperoxic with a reduced OEI (17%). Five patients were normoxic, but 2 had a reduced OEF (mean 15.9%). Two patients were hypoxic but had increased systemic O(2) utilization based on OEF or OEI. CONCLUSION: In select patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure, O(2) delivery (DO(2)) was found to exceed O(2) utilization.

The present study aims to meet the imperative necessity of effective COVID-19 drug treatment with a computational multi-target drug repurposing approach. This study focused on screening the FDA-approved drugs derived from the fungal source and its derivatives against the SARS-CoV-2 targets. All the selected drugs showed good binding affinity towards these targets, and out of them, bromocriptine was found to be the best candidate after the screening on the COVID-19 targets. Further, bromocriptine is analyzed by molecular simulation and MM-PBSA study. These studies suggested that bromocriptine can be the best candidate for TMPRSS2, Main protease, and RdRp protein.

In this work, a trajectory-based pedagogy was used to enhance the associative learning and it was integrated with a trajectory based adaptive assessment to evaluate the students learning in the Power Plant Instrumentation Course of seventh semester. Evaluation was done in two modes;as a regular IRT mode, where students scored on their performance against individual question, and in trajectory-based assessment, students scored on the performance of previous question. For both assessments, scores were calculated as 'Learning coefficients.' Analysis of these learning coefficients demonstrated that in absence of innovative teaching pedagogy and assessment techniques, students may score good grades, but these are insufficient to measure the Course Learning outcomes.

The initiative included provider education on eligibility criteria;workflow changes such as aspirin screening by ancillary staff, automated electronic medical record reminders and inclusion of aspirin screening criteria in clinic note templates;and standardized patient counseling. Patients were included in the analysis if they were >18 years old, English speaking, and < 28 weeks gestation at initial prenatal visit. The primary outcome was aspirin screening rate for new OB patients seen January-June 2021 (post-initiative) compared to September 2019-February 2020 (pre-initiative). We selected a pre-initiative time period remote from the post-initiative period to avoid confounding from workflow changes during the COVID pandemic. Bivariate comparisons assessed demographic differences across groups. Multivariable regression models controlling for race and insurance compared aspirin screening and prescription rates across time periods. Provider literacy was also compared pre- and post-intervention. Results: The 138 patients in the post-initiative group differed in race and insurance status from the 136 patients in the pre-initiative group (Table 1). Screening rate for the post-initiative group was 92.0% vs 62.5% for the pre-initiative group (Table 2;aOR 7.00, 95% CI 3.34-14.67). 85.7% of patients eligible for aspirin received a prescription post-initiative vs 36.8% of patients pre-initiative (aOR 10.13, 95% CI 5.11-20.09).

However, there has been no comprehensive review of the evidence to confirm the relationship between efficiency and fiscal space. Methods We conducted a systematic review to synthesize evidence on whether efficiency gains increase fiscal space for health. We searched bibliographic databases for specific keywords - namely, fiscal space, efficiency and health - and identified 22 articles that examined links between efficiency gains and fiscal space for health. The articles, which encapsulated 28 case studies, were included in the analysis. Results The 28 case studies varied widely with regard to how efficiency was evaluated, the extent to which efficiency was explored, and how efficiency gains could be achieved. Half of the studies assessed both technical and allocative efficiency, and the other half assessed technical efficiency only. The indicators to examine potential inefficiencies varied substantially among studies. The most frequently cited inefficiencies stemmed from public financial management (budget implementation, budget allocation and strategic purchasing) and governance issues, even though these were characterized in various ways. The second most cited set of inefficiencies that caused health systems to function poorly were those related to health service delivery. Procurement and delivery of input factors was also mentioned in some studies as a source of inefficiency. Though most studies conceded that efficiency gains were a potential means to improve fiscal space for health, very few quantified the potential gains or explored practical mechanisms to translate efficiency gains into fiscal space for health. Conclusions While the conceptual link between efficiency gains and fiscal space for health may be assumed, there is no direct empirical evidence proving that efficiency gains translate into more resources for the health sector. Mechanisms to translate efficiency gains into fiscal space are barely explored in the fiscal space literature. Public financial management rules and related rules for reallocating funds within the sector need to be further examined to guide countries in the transformation of efficiency gains into more resources for health.","output":"Improving fiscal space for health from the perspective of efficiency in low- and middle-income countries: What is the evidence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: We studied the trend of antimicrobial resistance and consumption at Saint George Hospital University Medical Center (SGHUMC), a tertiary care center in Beirut, Lebanon, with a focus on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

We considered MarchCDecember 2020 a surrogate of COVID-19. We considered one culture/patient for each antimicrobial susceptibility and excluded Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus coagulase-negative, and Corynebacterium species. We analyzed the trends of the overall isolates, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of blood isolates (BSI), difficult-to-treat (DTR) BSI, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) BSI, and restricted antimicrobial consumption as daily-defined-dose/1000 PD. DTR implies resistance to carbapenems, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and additional antimicrobials where applicable. Results and Discussion: After applying exclusion criteria, we analyzed 1614 blood cultures out of 8314 cultures. We isolated 85 species, most commonly Eco, at 52%. The isolation density of total BSI in 2020 decreased by 16%: 82 patients were spared from bacteremia, with 13 being DTR. The isolation density of CRE BSI/1000 PD decreased by 64% from 2019 to 2020, while VREfm BSI decreased by 34%. There was a significant decrease of 80% in Ab isolates (p-value < 0.0001).

Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a holistic hospital intensive rehabilitation program, based on CR, on C-19 patients (P), after acute care, to improve their fitness, in order to return to their life in the best conditions. Methods: In the period april-august 2020, 30 P (mean age 73 years, 60% male) were admitted to the rehabilitation centre at a mean distance of 3111 days from the onset of C-19;34% of them had undergone prolonged invasive ventilation, 34% non invasive ventilation and 32% required high flow oxygen. Comorbidities were: hypertension (77%), diabetes (13%) and chronic coronary syndrome (10%);18 P were unable to stand, and 12 showed impaired trunk control. No P had impaired LVEF or significant valvular disease. Initially, the program focused on training for trunk and sitting control;then on exercises for straightening the upper and lower limbs. From the second week, started a CR training on the cycle ergometer 10- 20 minutes a day for 6 days a week, similar protocol to that used in P with heart failure. The aerobic training was of moderate intensity, not exceeding 40-60% of the maximum heart rate, Borg scale 10-12, starting with zero load, gradually increasing by 10-15 watts and up to a minimum target of 25-30 watts. The impact of the protocol on motor functions [MRC Muscle Strenght Scale, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)] on functional capacity [6 Minutes Walking Test (6MWT)] on anxiety (A) and depression (D) [Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAMD)] and on basic activities of daily life [Barthel Index (BI)] were evaluated. The assessment was done on the admission (T0), at the discharge (T1, on average after 31 days) and after a follow-up of 55 days (T3). Results: The results are shown in the table below. Only 4 P were able to perform the 6MWT at T0. The motor function improves rapidly and then reaches a plateau and its trend is reflected in the BI. Functional capacity, on the other hand, improves significantly even at a distance. A and D decreased rapidly but increased over time. Conclusions: A rehabilitation protocol, centered on CR, induces a rapid increase in motor capacity, even in severely compromised subjects such as C-19. The improvement in fitness over time, as demonstrated by the 6MWT, probably is due to the severe muscle deconditioning, for the long stay in acute care. The long-term worsening of A and D may depend on various causes: no longer living in a protected and safe place, the fear of relapse, returning home and discovering new deaths and mournings. A program, CR-like, can counteract many of the negative consequences of C-19;however these P deserve an outpatient rehabilitation to maintain and consolidate the positive results over time.

A complete cDNA clone of a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) DI RNA, NE-1, containing a single nucleotide deletion in the 5 region of the ORF was obtained and analyzed. Due to this single nucleotide deletion, a DI-specific protein of 7.5-kDa was made from NE-1, in contrast to the 88-kDa protein made from the wild-type DI RNA. NE-1 RNA was efficiently replicated after transfection into MHV-infected cells. However, after one passage of NE-1 RNA-containing virus, the 88-kDa wild-type protein was synthesized, indicating that the large ORF was restored during NE-1 DI RNA replication. Sequence analysis of NE-1 DI RNA from infected cells demonstrated that in approximately half of the DI RNA population, the ORF was restored by RNA recombination between NE-1 DI RNA and helper virus genomic sequence. The sequences of other DI RNAs contained an additional nontemplated A? at the five-A? sequence nine nucleotides upstream of the deletion site, resulting in a stretch of six consecutive A? s. In these \\"edited\\"-type DI RNAs, the original nucleotide deletion was maintained and no RNA recombination was observed. This \\"editing\\" produced an ORF of the same size as the wild-type DI RNA. We conclude that the DI RNA with a large ORF has a selective advantage. There was no significant difference in replication efficiency among these RNAs when they replicated alone. However, cotransfection of two DI RNA species and time course experiments suggested that homologous interference and other mechanism(s) during the early stage of virus multiplication are responsible for the accumulation of DI RNAs containing the large ORF.","output":"Generation and Selection of Coronavirus Defective Interfering RNA with Large Open Reading Frame by RNA Recombination and Possible Editing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing (December 2020), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already caused more than one million deaths worldwide, and therefore, it is imperative to find effective treatments.

SARS-CoV-2 can also invade the brain and cause neuro-inflammation with dramatic neurological manifestations, such as viral encephalitis.

Several pathways/mechanisms could explain the link between viral infection and development of psychiatric diseases, especially neuro-inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is important to find molecules with anti-inflammatory properties that penetrate easily into the brain. For instance, some antidepressants have anti-inflammatory action and pass easily through the blood brain barrier.

METHODS: In summer 2020 a convergent parallel-mixed methods' approach was adopted. It includes 3 focus groups in skiing resorts of Tyrol and Vorarlberg, a quantitative complete online survey, with mayors of municipalities, managing directors of all cable cars companies as tourism associations and 22 qualitative expert interviews with this target groups. RESULTS: There were 105 out of 375 mayors of municipalities, 57 out of 140 managing directors of all cable cars companies and 37 out of 41 tourism associations of Tyrol and Vorarlberg participating in the online survey. The demand for a standardized risk management in tourism was high, the willingness to compromise low. Inconsistent legal regulations, economic losses, acknowledging risks and taking responsibility for the own area of influence were conflicting topics. CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty about legal requirements was widespread and therefore mitigating strategies and measures were often classified as a disturbance. Economic concerns where far more prevalent than concerns about public health, blaming other decision-makers was a common strategy. According to the results authorities where advised to: -reduce complexity and increase transparency within the communication -demonstrate uniformity without exceptions; -show solidarity to facilitate willingness to compromise; -provide future perspectives.

Public Health England initiated a study, COVID-19 Surveillance in School KIDs (sKIDs), in primary schools when they partially reopened from June 1, 2020, after the first national lockdown in England to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence, and seroconversion in staff and students. METHODS: sKIDs, an active, prospective, surveillance study, included two groups: the weekly swabbing group and the blood sampling group. The swabbing group underwent weekly nasal swabs for at least 4 weeks after partial school reopening during the summer half-term (June to mid-July, 2020). The blood sampling group additionally underwent blood sampling for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to measure previous infection at the beginning (June 1-19, 2020) and end (July 3-23, 2020) of the summer half-term, and, after full reopening in September, 2020, and at the end of the autumn term (Nov 23-Dec 18, 2020). We tested for predictors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity using logistic regression. We calculated antibody seroconversion rates for participants who were seronegative in the first round and were tested in at least two rounds. FINDINGS: During the summer half-term, 11 966 participants (6727 students, 4628 staff, and 611 with unknown staff or student status) in 131 schools had 40 501 swabs taken. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 41 (one of 24 463; 95% CI 01-218) per 100 000 students and 125 (two of 16 038; 15-450) per 100 000 staff. At recruitment, in 45 schools, 91 (112%; 95% CI 79-151) of 816 students and 209 (151%; 119-189) of 1381 staff members were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, similar to local community seroprevalence. Seropositivity was not associated with school attendance during lockdown (p=013 for students and p=020 for staff) or staff contact with students (p=037). At the end of the summer half-term, 603 (739%) of 816 students and 1015 (735%) of 1381 staff members were still participating in the surveillance, and five (four students, one staff member) seroconverted. By December, 2020, 55 (51%; 95% CI 38-65) of 1085 participants who were seronegative at recruitment (in June, 2020) had seroconverted, including 19 (56%; 34-86) of 340 students and 36 (48%; 34-66) of 745 staff members (p=060).

For instance, digital health technologies are capable of measuring environmental pollution and predicting its adverse health effects. Several health conditions, including chronic airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can be exacerbated by pollution. These diseases impose substantial health burdens with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, efforts have been made to develop digital technologies to alleviate such conditions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated the application of telemedicine and telemonitoring for patients with chronic airway diseases. This article reviews current trends and studies in digital technology utilization for investigating and managing environmental exposure and chronic airway diseases. First, we discussed the recent progression of digital technologies in general environmental healthcare.

METHODS Thirty-five older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus were assigned to 2 groups according to their frailty status: exercise training group (prefrail or frail; n = 21; 74.7 [4.5] y; 33.3% male) and control group (robust; n = 14; 73.1 [3.9] y; 42.9% male). The exercise training group followed a multicomponent training program focusing on muscle power: supervised (5 wk) and unsupervised (6 wk). The primary outcomes, including PA and sitting time, perceived disability, and HRQoL, were assessed at the baseline and after 11 weeks. RESULTS At the end of confinement, there were significant decreases in PA in both groups (P < .05). Thus, sitting time increased more in the control group than in the exercise training group (P < .05). The HRQoL measures remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS Muscle power training before and during mandatory COVID-19 self-isolation in type 2 diabetes mellitus older adults (1) attenuates the COVID-19 domiciliary confinement-related increase in sitting time and (2) slightly decreases the self-reported levels of disability and maintains HRQoL.","output":"Effects of Power Training on Physical Activity, Sitting Time, Disability, and Quality of Life in Older Patients With Type 2 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Confinement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The worldwide spread of COVID-19 (new coronavirus found in 2019) is an emergent issue to be tackled.

The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional study design and used qualitative research methods.

Three superordinate themes were derived: (1) Drivers to help-seeking; (2) Barriers to help-seeking; and (3) Experiences of services. The findings indicate difficulties in help-seeking for IPVA among civilian partners of military personnel due to stigma, fear, dependency, poor understanding of IPVA, lack of appropriate and timely support, and a perceived lack of victim support. Difficulties in help-seeking were perceived by participants to be amplified by military culture, public perceptions of the military, military protection of personnel and the lack of coordination between civilian and military judicial services.

Combined with many trends that were already under way pre-pandemic, the current situation has generated significant disruption and underscored the need for change within and across AMCs. In this article, the authors explore some of the major issues and propose actionable solutions in 3 areas of concentration. First, the impact on medical students is considered, particularly the tradeoffs associated with online learning and the need to place greater pedagogical emphasis on virtual care delivery and other skills that will be increasingly in demand. Solutions described include greater utilization of technology, building more public health knowledge into the curriculum, and partnering with a wide range of academic disciplines. Second, leadership recruiting, vital to long-term success for AMCs, has been complicated by the crisis. Pressures discussed include adapting to the dynamics of competitive physician labor markets as well as attracting candidates with the skill sets to meet the requirements of a shifting AMC leadership landscape. Solutions proposed in this domain include making search processes more focused and streamlined, prioritizing creativity and flexibility as core management capabilities to be sought, and enhancing efforts with assistance from outside advisors. Finally, attention is devoted to the severe financial impact wrought by the pandemic, creating challenges whose resolution is central to planning future AMC directions. Specific challenges include recovery of lost clinical revenue and cash flow, determining how to deal with research funding, and the precarious economic balancing act engendered by the need to continue distance education.

Expansion of the global population and Westernization of Asian diets have surged the number of meat eaters, which has eventually disrupted the supplyCdemand balance of meat. In contrast, some people do not eat meat for religious reasons or due to veganism. With these multiple circumstances, our society has begun to resort to obtaining protein from plant sources rather than animal origins. This protein shift urges food researchers to develop high-quality foods based on plant proteins. Meanwhile, patients with food allergies, especially gluten-related ones, are reported to be increasing. Additionally, growing popularity of the gluten-free diet demands development of foods without using ingredients of wheat origin. Besides, consumers prefer clean-label products in which products are expected to contain fewer artificial compounds. These diversified demands on foods have spurred the development of new foods in view of food-processing technologies as well as selection of the primary ingredients. In this short review, examples of foodstuffs that have achieved tremendous recent progress are introduced: effective use of plant protein realized low-carb, high protein, gluten-free bread/pasta.

Further, 4 of them (Saransk, Nizhny Novgorod, Penza, Ulyanovsk) were combined into one group  the Volga region. The study included men and women aged 30-69 years with one or more NCDs (hypertension, coronary artery disease with or without myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma and cancer in patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) who were self-isolated during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. For all patients, a questionnaire was used, which included socio-demographic parameters, behavioral risk factors, status of the underlying disease, incidence of COVID-19 and its complications. Self-assessment of the state of health was carried out using the European Quality of Life Questionnaire. Results. In every third Muscovite, the intensity of physical activity decreased, and in the groups of patients from Omsk and the Volga region, it was 45% and 43%, respectively. An increase in meal frequency and an impairment of eating habits in Moscow and Omsk was noted in 18,2% and 18,7% of participants, while in Volga region subjects, these parameters were 2 times higher (42,4%). At the same time, no significant changes of alcohol consumption and smoking was revealed in the cohorts. Hypertensive crises during a pandemic were noted in all three subgroups, but more of them were recorded in the Volga region  in every third patient (p<0,05 compared to Moscow), in the Omsk group  in every fourth patient, and among Muscovites  no more than 5%. Clinical deterioration in patients with angina was noted in 15% of cases, while the smallest number was noted in Omsk subjects (5,3%), three times less than in other subgroups. Changes in intensity and regimen of hypoglycemic therapy were noted in patients from Omsk, while 30% of them (p<0,05 compared with the Volga region) increased the doses of medications taken. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was registered in the group with the largest number of Volga region patients  14,1% (p<0,05 compared to Omsk), while 17% of patients in this group increased the dose of drugs.

The model adopts the form of a nonlinear susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered system, and we investigate it both analytically and numerically. Analytically, we obtain the equilibrium points in the presence and absence of the coronavirus. We also calculate the reproduction number and provide conditions that guarantee the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibria. To that end, various tools from analysis will be employed, including Volterra-type Lyapunov functions, LaSalles invariance principle and the RouthCHurwitz criterion. To simulate computationally the dynamics of propagation of the disease, we propose a nonstandard finite-difference scheme to approximate the solutions of the mathematical model.

Previous work with the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has shown that a major determinant of the N-M interaction maps to the carboxy-terminal domain 3 of the N protein. To explore other domain interactions of the MHV N protein, we expressed a series of segments of the MHV N protein as fusions with green fluorescent protein (GFP) during the course of viral infection. We found that two of these GFP-N-domain fusion proteins were selectively packaged into virions as the result of tight binding to the N protein in the viral nucleocapsid, in a manner that did not involve association with either M protein or RNA. The nature of each type of binding was further explored through genetic analysis. Our results defined two strongly interacting regions of the N protein. One is the same domain 3 that is critical for M protein recognition during assembly.

In the context of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada, we characterized trends in daily cannabis use in the overall sample and various population subgroups, and examined risk characteristics associated with daily cannabis use. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was operationalized using data from six waves of a national, online survey of adults residing in Canada who spoke English (N = 6,021; May-08 2020 to December-01 2020). Trends were characterized using the Cochran-Armitage test and risk characteristics were identified using chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Daily cannabis use in the overall sample remained stable (5.34% C 6.10%; p = 0.30). This pattern of findings extended to various population subgroups as well. The odds of daily cannabis use were higher for those who: were males (Odds Ratio; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.46; 1.15 C 1.85), were between 18 C 29 years (2.36; 1.56 C 3.57), 30 C 39 years (2.65; 1.93 C 3.64) or 40C49 years (1.74; 1.19 C 2.54), self-identified as white (1.97; 1.47 C 2.64), had less than college or university completion (1.78; 1.39 C 2.28), engaged in heavy episodic drinking (2.05; 1.62 C 2.61), had a job that increased the risk of contracting COVID-19 (1.38; 1.01 C 1.88), experienced loneliness 5C7 days in the past week (1.86; 1.26 C 2.73) and felt very worried (2.08; 1.21 C 3.58) or somewhat worried (1.83; 1.11 C 3.01) about the pandemics impact on their financial situation.

Combining historical, theoretical, and socio-empirical insights, this paper aims at expanding our understanding of the way temporality emerges and is negotiated in the contemporary practice of cryopreservation of reproductive materials. We first present an historical overview of the practice of cryo-fertility to indicate the co-production of technology and social constructions of temporality. We then apply a theoretical framework for analysing cryobiology and cryopreservation technologies as creating a new epistemic perspective interconnecting biology and temporality. Thereafter, we focus on the case of social egg freezing (SEF) to present socio-empirical findings illustrating different reproductive temporalities and their connection to the social acceptance of and expectations towards the practice. SEF is a particularly interesting case as it aims to enable women to disconnect their reproductive potential from their biological rhythms. Based on 39 open interviews with Israeli and German SEF users, the cross-cultural comparative findings reveal three types of attitudes: postponing motherhood/reproductive decisions (German users); singlehood and waiting for a partner (Israeli and German users); and the planning of and hope for multiple children (Israeli users). For theory building, this analysis uncovers temporality formations embedded in gender and reproductive moral values; including the extended present, waiting, and reproductive futurism. We conclude by discussing the contribution of our findings by advancing the theoretical framework of cryopolitics highlighting the theoretical implications and importance of gendered and cultural imaginaries (re)constructing medical technological innovations and related temporalities.","output":"The emergence of temporality in attitudes towards cryo-fertility: a case study comparing German and Israeli social egg freezing users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the relative contribution of pulmonary diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and sleep apnea) to mortality risks associated with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) independent of other medical conditions, health risks, and sociodemographic factors.

Methods CMP is a data source from Kantar, Health Division, containing data on cancer epidemiology and treatment. Once a year, Kantar performs a series of surveys with specialists in the field of interest in the United States of America (USA), Western Europe (WE), Japan, and China. The results of the survey reported in this work comprise the answers from 94 USA and 99 WE physicians about the treatment of melanoma. Results In the first-line for the BRAF wild-type population, immuno-oncology (IO) drugs including nivolumab, ipilimumab or pembrolizumab (alone or in combination) were used in 80.1% of the cases in the USA and 70.6% in WE. Conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments were used in 16.4% of the USA patients and 28.2% in WE. In the second-line in the USA, 45.8% of BRAF wild-type patients received IO drugs, while 45.0% of patients received conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments. The majority of patients with BRAF mutant advanced/metastatic melanoma were treated in the first-line with BRAF-targeted therapy (61.3% USA, 71.9% WE), and few patients received conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments (11.9% USA, 12.4% WE); the most commonly used BRAF-targeted therapy was the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib. In the second-line, BRAF mutant patients received IO drugs (45.1% USA, 53.7% WE), targeted therapy (37.6% USA, 32% WE) or conventional chemotherapy/cytokine-based treatments (14.4% USA, 11.7% WE). Conclusion The use of IO or targeted therapy for patients with advanced/metastatic melanoma is the preferred treatment strategy by physicians in the USA and WE based on BRAF mutation status.

At the same time, school closures forced children to rearrange their lives and learning processes: in Italy, schools and nurseries were closed for four months, and the incidence and quality of distance learning activities was heterogeneous across education levels and among schools. Using real-time survey data on families with under-16 children collected in April 2020, which include information on parents' market and household work, and their perception of their children's wellbeing, we estimate how the lockdown has affected children's use of time, their emotional status and their home learning, and whether the reallocation of intrahousehold responsibilities during the lockdown played a role in this process. Changes in the parental division of household tasks and childcare, mostly induced by the labor market restrictions imposed during the lockdown, point to a greater involvement of fathers in childcare and homeschooling activities. This positive variation in fathers' involvement is accompanied by an increase in children's emotional wellbeing and by a reduction in TV and passive screen time. On the other hand, the quality of children's home learning does not appear to depend on which parent is overseeing their work, but rather on the type of distance learning activities proposed by their teachers.","output":"Fathers matter: Intrahousehold responsibilities and children's wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphs are by nature unifying abstractions that can leverage interconnectedness to represent, explore, predict, and explain real- and digital-world phenomena.

Using a social practice perspective, we explore how California's Shelter-in-Place (SIP) order impacted household energy activities. To do so, we conducted an online survey of California residents (n = 804) during active SIP restrictions (May 5C18, 2020). We asked respondents about changes to home occupancy patterns and household energy activities (e.g., cooking, electronics usage) due to SIP restrictions, as well as perspectives toward smart energy technologies. Households reported increased midday (10amC3pm) occupancy during SIP, and this increase is related to respondent and household characteristics, such as education and the presence of minors in the home. Examining change in the frequency of household activities during SIP, presence of minors and increased midday occupancy proved important. Finally, we considered relationships to intention to purchase smart home technologies, with the presence of minors and increased activity frequency relating to greater intention to purchase. These findings demonstrate how household activities and occupancy changed under COVID restrictions, how these changes may be related to energy use in the home, and how such COVID-related changes could be shaping perspectives toward smart home technology, potentially providing insight into future impacts on household practices and electricity demand.","output":"Exploring the effects of California's COVID-19 shelter-in-place order on household energy practices and intention to adopt smart home technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC), which is the most commonly transfused blood component, due to its ability to save a life in absence of any other blood components, can be stored up to maximum 6 weeks by following standard preservation procedure. During storage, RBC undergoes various biophysical and biochemical changes (commonly known as storage lesion) for which blood transfusion with \\"old RBC\\" shows a lot of clinical problems especially relevant to critically ill patients. Recent research on S-nitrosylation of haemoglobin to improve oxygen delivery of banked blood revealed the important role of nitric oxide (NO) in protecting storage lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we used various \\"NO donating\\" chemicals with different NO release dynamics and chemistries in RBC storage cocktails to test the effects of NO on storage lesion. Changes in different storage markers were evaluated after 7 days storage of pre-treated RBC. RESULTS: All the NO donors have shown protection against hemolysis. However, S-nitroso glutathione (GSNO) ranks first in shielding RBCs from storage lesion and additionally, it helps in elevating the value of 2, 3-di phosphoglycerate (2, 3-DPG), improving the RBC membrane fluidity and decreasing the adhesion towards endothelial monolayer. DISCUSSION: Present study reveals that NO released from NO donors confers protection against storage lesions of the RBC. Further, the study confirms that pre-treatment with GSNO, a NO donor and a nitrosylating agent, ensures the best protection to RBC during low temperature storage, when compared to other NO donor treatments.","output":"Nitric oxide donors offer protection to RBC from storage lesion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Anti-malarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine are indicated in several rheumatic diseases such as RA. Some reports have suggested hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19. Objectives: Whether hydroxychloroquine has prophylactic effects for COVID-19 in rheumatic patients. Patients and Methods: In this multicenter cohort-based observational study the preventive effect of hydroxychloroquine regarding the incidence and severity of COVID-19 was investigated in patients with RA who referred to rheumatology clinics of academic hospitals of Isfahan between April and July 2020 and already have been treated with hydroxychloroquine for more than three months. Around 215 patients with RA and current use of hydroxychloroquine were recruited and followed for three months. Patients' information was gathered using the medical record or by phone call. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 in this selected sample was 4.2% (n=9). Only one in nine patients needed hospitalization, without need for intubation or ICU care. Symptoms including dry cough, headache, body pain, malaise, dyspnea, fever, sore throat, chills, and chest pain, were reported to be statistically higher in COVID-19+ group. Conclusion: In contrast to the mortality rate in the general population of Isfahan, Iran (4.8% - until June 2020), no mortality has been reported in these patients. Therefore, it seems that the use of hydroxychloroquine has been able to reduce the incidence and severity of the disease after reaching steady-state levels.

Following progress toward global measles elimination, reducing measles mortality, and increasing introductions of measles and rubella vaccines to national programs, the measles and rubella immunization program has faced setbacks in recent years. Currently available vaccine delivery methods have complicated logistics and drawbacks that create barriers to vaccination; innovations for easier, more efficient, and safer vaccine delivery are needed. Progress can be accelerated by new technologies like microarray patches (MAPs) that are now widely recognized as a potential new tool for enhancing global immunizations efforts. Clinical trials of measles-rubella vaccine MAPs have begun, and several other vaccine MAPs are in the pre-clinical development pathway. MAPs could significantly contribute to Immunization Agenda 2030 priorities, including reaching zero-dose children; increasing vaccine access, demand, coverage, and equity; and achieving measles and rubella elimination.

However, there remains uncertainty about the efficacy of vaccines against different variants of the virus. Here we assessed efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) against lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Brazil from June 2020 until early 2021. Methods: Participants aged 18 and above were enrolled into a randomised phase 3 trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or control (1st dose: Men ACWY vaccine, 2nd dose: normal saline). Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing was performed if participants developed symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, shortness of breath, fever >37.8C, ageusia, anosmia). Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2, sequenced, and viral load determined. For those samples where a genotype could not be ascertained from sequencing, allele specific PCR was performed. The efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a NAAT positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were unblinded after the vaccine was authorised for use, and the control participants offered vaccination. Infections occurring after unblinding were excluded from analysis. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 100% x (1 C relative risk (RR)), where RR was estimated from a robust Poisson model. The trial is registered at ISRCTN89951424. Findings: 9433 participants were eligible for inclusion in the pre-specified primary efficacy population, having reached more than 14 days after a second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, of whom 307 were NAAT+, in this post-hoc analysis. From June 2020 to February 2021, the two most frequently identified lineages were P.2 (N=153) and B.1.1.28 (N=49). P.1 emerged during the study (N=18) but became dominant only after study unblinding. Viral loads were highest amongst those with P.1 infection. Vaccine efficacy (VE) for B.1.1.33 (88.2%, 95%CI 5, 99), B.1.1.28 (73%, 95% CI, 46, 86), P.2 (69% 95% CI, 55, 78) and P.1 (64%, 95% CI, -2, 87) was estimated. In participants who had received two doses of vaccine, one COVID-19 hospitalisation occurred in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 18 in the control group, with VE against hospitalisation 95% (95% CI 61, 99). There were 2 COVID-19 deaths in the control group and none in the vaccine group. Interpretation ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 provides high efficacy against hospitalisation, severe disease and death from COVID-19 in Brazil and there is strong evidence of protection being maintained against P.2, despite the presence of the spike protein mutation E484K. Real world effectiveness studies are ongoing in Brazil to further establish protection against P.1 and other emerging variants.","output":"Efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Brazil;an exploratory analysis of a randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health issue worldwide. A broad amount of information related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was disseminated by social media in Ethiopia. To date, there is limited evidence on the influence of social media use for COVID-19-related information on COVID-19 preventive practice. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the influence of social media use on the practice of COVID-19 preventive measures in Ethiopia. METHODS: This study used an anonymous Internet-based online cross-sectional survey using Google Forms to collect the data from the respondents from May 15 to June 17, 2020, in Ethiopia. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between social media use as a predictor and COVID-19 preventive practice, after adjusting for socio-demographic and risk perception of COVID-19 variables. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: A total of 372 respondents have participated in the study. From 372, a total of 208 (55.9%) respondents in this study were male. Study participants who had good use of social media to get COVID-19-related information were 9.5 times more engaged in COVID-19 preventive practices compared with study participants who had poor use of social media to get COVID-19-related information (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 9.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.70-16.13). Also, study participants who had a high-risk perception of COVID-19 were 2.6 times more engaged in COVID-19 practices compared with study participants who had a low-risk perception of COVID-19 (AOR = 2.63; 95% CI: 1.58-4.38). Study participants who were students at the time of this study were 4 times more likely to show an adequate COVID-19 preventive practice score compared with those who had another occupational status (AOR = 4.07; 95% CI: 1.66-9.98). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the use of social media networks can have a positive effect on the practice of preventive measures and public safety against COVID-19; high-risk perception contributed to preventive activities against COVID-19.

Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of the novel SARS-CoV2 infection and progression can provide potential novel targets for its prevention and/or treatment. Virus microbiota reciprocal interactions have been studied in a variety of viral infections. For example, the integrity of Coronavirus particles can be disrupted by surfactin, a bacterial surface molecule that targets other viruses, including that of influenza A. In this light, intestinal microbiota likely influences COVID-19 virulence, while from its side SARS-CoV-2 may affect the intestinal microbiome promoting dysbiosis and other deleterious consequences. Hence, the microbiota pre-existing health status and its alterations in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are likely to play an important, still underscored role in determining individual susceptibility and resilience to COVID-19. Indeed, the vast majority of COVID-19 worst clinical conditions and fatalities develop in subjects with specific risk factors such as aging and the presence of one or more comorbidities, which are intriguingly characterized also by unhealthy microbiome status. Moreover, these comorbidities require complex pharmacological regimens known as polypharmacy that may further affect microbiota integrity and worsen the resilience to viral infections. This complex situation may represent a further and underestimated risk with regard to COVID-19 clinical burden for the elderly and comorbid people. Here, we discuss the possible biological, physiopathological, and clinical implications of gut microbiota in COVID-19 and the strategies to improve/maintain its healthy status as a simple and adjunctive strategy to reduce COVID-19 virulence and socio-sanitary burden.","output":"Gut Microbiota Status in COVID-19: An Unrecognized Player?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this rapid review, we aimed to evaluate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on renal functions and mortality of patients with kidney diseases.

Contexts and practices that aim to be trauma-informed strive to attend to the complex impacts of trauma, integrating knowledge into policies and practices, and providing a sanctuary from harm. However, there is a body of critical and decolonial scholarship that challenges the ways in which trauma-informed practice prioritizes individualized interventions, reinscribes colonial power relations through its conceptualizations of safety, and obscures the role of systemic injustices. Within music therapy trauma scholarship, research has thus far pointed to the affordances of music in ameliorating symptoms of trauma, bypassing unavailable cognitive processes, and working from a strengths-based orientation. In critiquing the tendency of the dominant trauma paradigm to assign vulnerability and reinforce the individuals responsibility to develop resilience through adversity, this conceptual analysis outlines potential alternatives within music therapy. Drawing on a case example from a research project with young people in school, I elucidate the ways in which music therapy can respond to power relations as they occur within and beyond trauma-informed spaces. I highlight two overarching potentials for music therapy within a shifting trauma paradigm: (1) as a site in which to reframe perceived risk by fostering young peoples resistance and building their political agency and (2) in challenging the assumption of safe spaces and instead moving toward practices of structuring safety.","output":"The Limits of Resilience and the Need for Resistance: Articulating the Role of Music Therapy With Young People Within a Shifting Trauma Paradigm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United Kingdom was assessed as a low risk country throughout the 2003 global SARS outbreaks.

We analyzed data on 69 infections in Wuxi to describe the diseases characteristics, to analyze factors of cases clinical outcome and to evaluate the prevention and control measures. METHODS: The demographic characteristics, exposure history, time indicators and propagation dynamics in Wuxi were collected. RESULTS: The clinical severity of cases was mostly mild and normal (75.36%). Aging (relative risk [RR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.001-1.08) and fever (RR = 10.33, 95%CI: 2.75-38.78) were risk factors for disease severity. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 4.77 days (95% CI: 3.61-5.94), with a mean serial interval of 6.31 days (95% CI: 5.12-7.50). The controlled reproduction number was estimated to be 1.12 (95%CI: 0.71-1.69). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 in Wuxi has turned into a lower level, suggesting the early prevention and control measures have achieved effectiveness.

Studies distinguishing post-COVID conditions from late conditions caused by other etiologies are lacking. Using data from a large administrative all-payer database, we assessed the type, association, and timing of post-COVID conditions following COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) (release date, October 20, 2020) data, during MarchCJune 2020, 27,589 inpatients and 46,857 outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 (case-patients) were 1:1 matched with patients without COVID-19 through the 4-month follow-up period (control-patients) by using propensity score matching. In this matched-cohort study, adjusted odds ratios were calculated to assess for late conditions that were more common in case-patients compared with control-patients. Incidence proportion was calculated for conditions that were more common in case-patients than control-patients during 31C120 days following a COVID-19 encounter. RESULTS: During 31C120 days after an initial COVID-19 inpatient hospitalization, 7.0% of adults experienced at least one of five post-COVID conditions. Among adult outpatients with COVID-19, 7.7% experienced at least one of ten post-COVID conditions. During 31C60 days after an initial outpatient encounter, adults with COVID-19 were 2.8 times as likely to experience acute pulmonary embolism as outpatient control-patients and were also more likely to experience a range of conditions affecting multiple body systems (e.g. nonspecific chest pain, fatigue, headache, and respiratory, nervous, circulatory, and gastrointestinal system symptoms) than outpatient control-patients. Children with COVID-19 were not more likely to experience late conditions than children without COVID-19.

The relapse rate is high, and the negative impact on individuals, families and society is severe, therefore exploring social psychological mechanisms to reduce relapse has very important theoretical and practical value. However, the underlying mechanism by which the interaction between family and individual factors influences the tendency to relapse remain unclear. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the relationship between family intimacy and relapse tendency of people who use drugs, as well as the mediating effect of psychological capital and the role of self-efficacy in it. METHODS: A total of 817 male who use drugs were investigated via the Family Intimacy and Adaptability Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Positive Psychological Capital Questionnaire and Relapse Tendency Questionnaire. Using Hayess process macro carried out moderated mediation analysis. RESULTS: (1) The average family intimacy score of people who use drugs was low. (2) Family intimacy negatively predicted relapse tendency in people who use drugs. (3) Psychological capital mediated the relationship between family intimacy and relapse tendency. (4) The first half of the indirect effect of family intimacy on relapse tendency was regulated by self-efficacy, compared with the low level of self-efficacy, the psychological capital level with high self-efficacy is higher.

Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intra peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) was reported as an interesting alternative regarding survival compared to surgery without HIPEC and/or systemic chemotherapy. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of CRS and HIPEC for patients presenting A-GCC through an international registry. METHODS A prospective multicenter international database was retrospectively searched to identify all patients with A-GCC tumor and peritoneal metastases who underwent CRS and HIPEC through the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI). The post-operative complications, long-term results, and principal prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS The analysis included 83 patients. After a median follow-up of 47 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 34.6 months. The 3- and 5-year OS was 48.5% and 35.7%, respectively. Patients who underwent complete macroscopic CRS had a significantly better survival than those treated with incomplete CRS. The 5-year OS was 44% and 0% for patients who underwent complete, and incomplete CRS, respectively (HR 9.65, p < 0.001). Lymph node involvement and preoperative chemotherapy were also predictive of a worse prognosis. There were 3 postoperative deaths, and 30% of the patients had major complications. CONCLUSION CRS and HIPEC may increase long-term survival in selected patients with peritoneal metastases of A-GCC origin, especially when complete CRS is achieved.

Prompt and accurate virus detection enables timely treatment and effective quarantine of virus carrier, and therefore effectively reduces the possibility of large-scale spread. However, conventional virus detection techniques often suffer from slow response, high cost or sophisticated procedures. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been used as promising sensing platforms for the high-performance detection of a variety of chemical and biological substances. The unique properties of 2D materials, such as large specific area, active surface interaction with biomolecules and facile surface functionalization, provide advantages in developing novel virus detection technologies with fast response and high sensitivity. Furthermore, 2D materials possess versatile and tunable electronic, electrochemical and optical properties, making them ideal platforms to demonstrate conceptual sensing techniques and explore complex sensing mechanisms in next-generation biosensors. In this review, we first briefly summarize the virus detection techniques with an emphasis on the current efforts in fighting again COVID-19. Then, we introduce the preparation methods and properties of 2D materials utilized in biosensors, including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other 2D materials.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare two nonpharmacological respiratory treatment methods for home-isolated COVID-19 patients using a newly developed telemanagement health care system. METHODS: In this single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with stage 1 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated. Group A (n=30) received oxygen therapy with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, and Group B (n=30) received osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques. Arterial blood gases of PaO2 and PaCO2, pH, vital signs (ie, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure), and chest computed tomography scans were used for follow-up and for assessment of the course and duration of recovery. RESULTS: Analysis of the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (P<.05), with Group A showing shorter recovery periods than Group B (mean 14.9, SD 1.7 days, and mean 23.9, SD 2.3 days, respectively). Significant differences were also observed between baseline and final readings in all of the outcome measures in both groups (P<.05). Regarding posttreatment satisfaction with our proposed telemanagement health care system, positive responses were given by most of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that home-based oxygen therapy with BiPAP can be a more effective prophylactic treatment approach than osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques, as it can impede exacerbation of early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia. Telemanagement health care systems are promising methods to help in the pandemic-related shortage of hospital beds, as they showed reasonable effectiveness and reliability in the monitoring and management of patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia.

METHODS: The programmatic data of ED-based HIV testing from July 2018 to March 2021 at the Memorial Regional Hospital, Hollywood, Florida was retrospectively analyzed. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis models were developed to evaluate the immediate and gradual effects of the pandemic on the monthly number of HIV tests over time, with an interruption point at March 2020. RESULTS: 45,185 HIV tests were recorded between July 2018 and March 2021. A mean of 1,745 (SD, 266) HIV tests per month before the COVID-19 pandemic (July 2018 to Feb 2020) and a mean of 791 (SD, 187) HIV tests per month during the pandemic period (March 2020 to March 2021) was seen (p< 0.0001). As shown in Table 1, there was a slight decline trend in the number of monthly HIV test before the pandemic (estimate -10.29, p=0.541). We estimated a significant decrease in monthly HIV tests (estimate -678.48, p = 0.008), whereas the slope change after the pandemic was non-significant (estimate 4.84, p = 0.891). The number of monthly HIV tests declined significantly during the early phase of the pandemic, particularly between March 2020 and September 2020 (all p< 0.05), with an estimated 48.0% decrease in the March 2020 (estimate -678.48, p = 0.007), 43% in the April 2020 (estimate -673.65, p=0.007), and 50.7% in the May 2020 (estimate -668.83, p=0.009), compared with the same month of the pre-pandemic period (Figure 1). This decline in number of monthly HIV tests is consistent with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Florida. Number of decreased monthly HIV tests from October 2020 through March 2021 was less pronounced (all p >0.05) and returned to pre-pandemic levels.

Disruption of basic health services by the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health concern. Strategies to develop an infrastructure to meet the demands of HIV testing should be implemented to ensure the current HIV prevention during the COVID-19 period.

Coronaviruses are positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses that infect several animal species, causing symptoms that range from those similar to the common cold to severe respiratory syndrome. The Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV2 functional receptor. Measures are currently undertaken worldwide to control the infection to avoid disruption of the social and economic equilibrium, especially in countries with poor healthcare resources. In a guarded optimistic view, we hope that the undertaken preventive and treatment measures will at least contribute to contain viral diffusion, attenuate activity, or even eliminate SARS-CoV2. In this review, we discuss emerging perspectives for prevention/treatment of COVID-19 infection. In addition to vaccines under development, passive immunization is an open opportunity since patients develop neutralizing antibodies. A full spectrum of potential drugs for COVID-19 infections could in turn affect virus binding or enzymatic activities involved in viral replication and transcription.

Tapentadol is a central analgesic with an improved tolerability profile that may be particularly beneficial to the elderly CLBP. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study to comparatively assess the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol in young and elderly patients with severe CLBP. Sixtyfive young patients (< 65 years) and 87 elderly patients (&#8805; 65 years) were titrated on tapentadol extended release to their optimal dose (25-250 mg bid) over 1 month and, then, maintained at that dose for 3 months. The primary endpoint were changes from baseline in 24-h pain intensity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at month-4 of treatment (titration plus maintenance periods). Patients were assessed for several efficacy and tolerability outcomes using a battery of scales and tests for neuropathic pain intensity, quality of life and sleep, and cognitive and gastrointestinal functions. RESULTS: At pretreatment, young and elderly patients had similar pain intensities with younger patients presenting with more intense depressive and neuropathic pain symptoms, and lesser comorbidities and durations of pain (P < 0.05). Thirty-eight patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events occurring mostly during titration. Treatment with tapentadol was associated with comparable and clinically meaningful pain reductions in 24-h NRS from baseline to treatment month-4 both in young and elderly patients (- 5.3  1.4 and - 4.8  2.1; P < 0.01); a 50% pain relief was achieved in 66% and 58% of young and elderly patients. The percentage of patients with a neuropathic component decreased similarly in young and elderly patients (from 38 to 0% and from 19 to 3%; P < 0.01). Quality of life and sleep improved. The performances in global cognition and sustained attention tasks remained stable or improved across all age group.

Distant metastases are seen in 50% of cases regardless of treatment, which contributes to high mortality rates. Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) is a protein regulator of mitotic entry and cytokinesis. Increased PLK-1 expression has been shown in different tumours, which makes its inhibition a potential treatment target. To date, no study has been published to discuss the prognostic role of PLK-1 expression in patients with uveal melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed by immunohistochemistry PLK-1 expression in uveal melanoma cells collected in 158 patients treated by primary enucleation. We determined the correlation between PLK-1 levels evaluated by the immunoreactivity scale (IRS) method and detailed clinical as well as histological parameters. Additionally, we determined the association between PLK-1 expression levels and long-term prognosis. RESULTS: Elevated PLK-1 expression in tumour cells, defined as IRS > 2, was observed in 70% (111/158) of cases, whereas low expression or no expression was seen in the remaining 30% (47/158) of patients. There was a significant correlation between low PLK-1 expression and a higher clinical tumour stage (pT, p = 0.04) as well as a higher AJCC prognostic stage group (p = 0.037). We observed an inverse correlation between PLK-1 expression and tumour cell pigment content (p = 0.0019). There was no correlation between PLK-1 expression and other histological parameters such as mitotic rate or histological subtype. The Kaplan-Meier's analysis demonstrated that low PLK-1 expression was associated with significantly reduced overall survival (p = 0.0058). A similar trend, albeit not significant, was observed for disease-free survival (p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS: Downregulated PLK-1 expression is a negative prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. It warrants further, multicentre research on prognostic role of PLK-1 expression and possibility of PLK-1 inhibition in uveal melanoma.","output":"Downregulation of Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) expression is associated with poor clinical outcome in uveal melanoma patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The indiscriminate use of nitrogenous fertilizers continues unabated for commercial crop production, resulting in air and water pollution.

Overall, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Pokkali (indica) was higher than in Bengal (japonica) during low N and early N recovery treatments. Most low N DEGs in both genotypes were downregulated whereas early N recovery DEGs were upregulated. Of these, 148 Pokkali-specific DEGs might contribute to Pokkali's advantage under N stress. These DEGs included transcription factors and transporters and were involved in stress responses, growth and development, regulation, and metabolism. Many DEGs are co-localized with quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to root growth and development, chlorate-resistance, and NUE.

Methods and results 7824 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a multicentre-international prospective registry (HOPE-COVID-19). Clinical data and in-hospital complications were recorded. Antiplatelet (AP) regimen, including aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs, was obtained for each patient. During hospitalization 730 (9%) patients received AP drugs with single (93%, n = 680) or dual APT (7%, n = 50). Patients treated with APT were older (74  12 vs. 63  17 years, P < 0.01), more frequently male (68% vs. 57%, P < 0.01) and had higher prevalence of diabetes (39% vs. 16%, P < 0.01).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen pediatric patients diagnosed with SCID were tested using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the validated Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) pre- and 1-year post-HSCT. Three years post-HSCT, there were 11 patients available for testing and four patients available 5 years post-HSCT. Patients greater than 3 years of age were administered the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Both raw scores and scaled scores were analyzed. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease 1 year post-HSCT in the Bayley Mental Developmental Index (MDI) [92.5 (pre) vs. 70.81 (1 year post), p < 0.0001] and the VABS [99.73 (pre) vs. 79.87 (1 year post), p = <0.0001]. There was a significant decrease over time in the MDI [95.00 (pre) vs. 72.64 (1 year post) vs. 71.82 (3 years post), p < 0.0001], but no significant change between 1 and 3 years post-HSCT. There was no change in the Bayley Psychomotor Development Scale (PDI) [82.4 (pre) vs. 84.8 (1 year post), p = 0.68]. The PDI scores decreased over time [86.29 (pre) vs. 86 (1 year post) vs. 74.14 (3 years post), p = 0.045]. Although there was a decrease in scaled scores, there was not a loss of skills. Analysis of raw scores showed that there was an increase in the raw test scores, which indicated that these children acquired developmental skills, but at a slower rate than normal infants and toddlers. Younger children had a more significant decrease in adaptive scores compared with older children. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may reflect the effects of the isolation and prolonged hospitalization that characterizes the immediate post-transplant period. Patients miss out on social interactions and learning opportunities that normally occur at their respective stages of development. These restrictions keep patients from acquiring developmentally appropriate cognitive skills as well as gross and fine motor developmental milestones.

We performed in-depth phenotyping of neutrophil and monocyte subpopulations and measured soluble activation markers in plasma. Additionally, anti-microbial functions (phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and NETosis) were evaluated on fresh cells from patients. Neutrophils and monocytes had a strikingly disturbed phenotype, and elevated concentrations of activation markers (calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophil extracellular traps) were measured in plasma. Critical patients had increased CD13(low) immature neutrophils, LOX-1 + and CCR5 + immunosuppressive neutrophils, and HLA-DR(low) downregulated monocytes. Markers of immature and immunosuppressive neutrophils were strongly associated with severity. Moreover, neutrophils and monocytes of critical patients had impaired antimicrobial functions, which correlated with organ dysfunction, severe infections, and mortality.

METHODS: We describe a patient who developed new-onset central hypocortisolism in the convalescent phase of mild COVID-19, which has not been previously reported. RESULTS: A 47-year-old man with recent COVID-19 upper respiratory tract infection developed new-onset persistent dyspepsia and eosinophilia for which multiple investigations were normal. He was eventually diagnosed with central hypocortisolism, as evidenced by 8 AM cortisol level of 19 nmol/L (normal, 133-537 nmol/L) and adrenocorticotropic hormone of 7.1 ng/mL (normal, 10.0-60.0 ng/mL). He was started on hydrocortisone, which led to resolution of both dyspepsia and eosinophilia. At the same time, an interesting thyroid function trend was observedan initial increase in both free thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone was followed by temporary central hypothyroidism before subsequent spontaneous recovery. On follow-up 3 weeks later, the patient remained hypocortisolemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 may be associated with the delayed onset of central hypocortisolism in its convalescent phase. Although various mechanisms are possible, hypothalamic-pituitary activation during systemic illness, followed by a rebound decrease in activity after recovery, is consistent with the clinical course and thyroid function trend in this patient.

Our aim was to discriminate the components of the working pressure of the respiratory system in infants on MV with severe bronchiolitis admitted to two PICUs. METHODS: Infants younger than 1 year old with acute respiratory failure caused by severe bronchiolitis underwent neuromuscular blockade, tracheal intubation and volume controlled MV. Shortly after intubation studies of pulmonary mechanics were performed using inspiratory and expiratory breath hold. The maximum inspiratory and expiratory flow (QI and QE) as well as peak inspiratory (PIP), plateau (PPL) and total expiratory pressures (tPEEP) were measured. Inspiratory and expiratory resistances (RawI and RawE) and Time Constants (K(TI) and K(TE)) were calculated. RESULTS: We included 16 patients, of median age 2.5 (1C5.8) months. Bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus was the main etiology (93.8%) and 31.3% had comorbidities. Measured respiratory pressures were PIP 29 (26C31), PPL 24 (20C26), tPEEP 9 [8C11] cmH2O. Elastic component of the working pressure was significantly higher than resistive and both higher than threshold (tPEEP C PEEP) (P < 0.01). QI was significantly lower than QE [5 (4.27C6.75) v/s 16.5 (12C23.8) L/min. RawI and RawE were 38.8 (32C53) and 40.5 (22C55) cmH2O/L/s; K(TI) and K(TE) [0.18 (0.12C0.30) v/s 0.18 (0.13C0.22) s], and K(TI):K(TE) ratio was 1:1.04 (1:0.59C1.42). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of respiratory mechanics of infants with severe bronchiolitis receiving MV shows that the elastic component of the working pressure of the respiratory system is the most important. The elastic and resistive components in conjunction with flow profile are characteristic of restrictive diseases.

We evaluated a novel Beanguard gargle (BG)-based virus collection method that can be applied to Ag-RDT as an alternative to the current RT-PCR with an NPS for early diagnosis of COVID-19. This clinical trial comprised 102 COVID-19-positive patients hospitalized after a governmental screening process and 100 healthy individuals. Paired NPS and BG-based saliva specimens from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals were analyzed using NPS-RT-PCR, BG-RT-PCR, and BG-Ag-RDTs, whose diagnostic performance for detecting SARS-CoV-2 was compared. BG-Ag-RDTs showed high sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (100%) in 45 patients within 6 days of illness and detected all cases of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants. In 11 asymptomatic active COVID-19 cases, both BG-Ag-RDTs and BG-RT-PCR showed sensitivities and specificities of 100%. Sensitivities of BG-Ag-RDT and BG-RT-PCR toward salivary viral detection were highly concordant, with no discrimination between symptomatic (97.0%), asymptomatic (100%), or SARS-CoV-2 variant (100%) cases. The intermolecular interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and truncated canavalin, an active ingredient from the bean extract (BE), were observed in terms of physicochemical properties. The detachment of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain from hACE2 increased as the BE concentration increased, allowing the release of the virus from hACE2 for early diagnosis. Using BG-based saliva specimens remarkably enhances the Ag-RDT diagnostic performance as an alternative to NPS and enables noninvasive, rapid, and accurate COVID-19 self-testing and mass screening, supporting efficient COVID-19 management. IMPORTANCE An Ag-RDT is less likely to be accepted as an initial test method for early diagnosis owing to its low sensitivity. However, our self-collection method, Ag-RDT using BG-based saliva specimens, showed significantly enhanced detection sensitivity and specificity toward SARS-CoV-2 including the Alpha and Delta variants in all patients tested within 6 days of illness. The method represents an attractive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for the early diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.

They function as a mode of intercellular communication and molecular transfer. Exosome cargo molecules, including small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), are involved in the immune response in various organisms. However, the role of exosome-derived sncRNAs in immune responses in molluscs remains unclear. Here, we aimed to reveal the sncRNAs involved in the immune response during grafting transplantation by the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. Exosomes were successfully extracted from the P. fucata haemolymph during graft transplantation. Abundant microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were simultaneously discovered in P. fucata exosomes by small RNA sequencing. The expression patterns of the miRNAs and piRNAs at the grafting and initial stages were not substantially different, but varied significantly between the initial and later stages. Target prediction and functional analysis indicate that these miRNAs and piRNAs are related to immune response upon grafting transplantation, whereas piRNAs may also be associated with transposon silencing by targeting with genome transposon elements. This work provides the basis for a functional understanding of exosome-derived sncRNAs and helps to gain further insight into the PIWI/piRNA pathway function outside of germline cells in molluscs.","output":"Exosome-derived small non-coding RNAs reveal immune response upon grafting transplantation in Pinctada fucata (Mollusca)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Rats were injected with a fractionated 50 ml/kg dose of Fluosol?-DA 20% with and without exposure to 100% oxygen.

Strangely, ample evidences have been shown that the severity of COVID-19 infections varies widely from children (asymptomatic), adults (mild infection), as well as elderly adults (deadly critical). It has proven that COVID-19 infection in some elderly critical adults leads to a cytokine storm, which is characterized by severe systemic elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, a cytokine storm can induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, as well as multiple organ failure in aged patients. It is far from clear till now why cytokine storm induces in only COVID-19 elderly patients, and not in young patients. However, it seems that aging is associated with mild elevated levels of local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is characterized by inflamm-aging. It is highly likely that inflamm-aging is correlated to increased risk of a cytokine storm in some critical elderly patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A systematic search in the literature was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, as well as Google Scholar pre-print database using all available MeSH terms for COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, senescent cell, cytokine storm, inflame-aging, ACE2 receptor, autophagy, and Vitamin D.

DESIGN Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis. SETTING Nsambya Hospital, Uganda. PARTICIPANTS Live births and stillbirths. INTERVENTIONS PND audit. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes: perinatal mortality rate, stillbirth rate, early neonatal mortality rate. SECONDARY OUTCOMES case fatality rates (CFR) for asphyxia, complications of prematurity and neonatal sepsis. RESULTS 526 PNDs were audited: 142 (27.0%) fresh stillbirths, 125 (23.8%) macerated stillbirths and 259 (49.2%) early neonatal deaths. The ITS analysis showed a decrease in perinatal death (PND) rates without the introduction of PND audits (incidence risk ratio (IRR) (95% CI) for time=0.94, p<0.001), but an increase in PND (IRR (95% CI)=1.17 (1.0 to -1.34), p=0.0021) following the intervention. However, when overdispersion was included in the model, there were no statistically significant differences in PND with or without the intervention (p=0.06 and p=0.44, respectively). Stillbirth rates exhibited a similar pattern. By contrast, early neonatal death rates showed an overall upward trend without the intervention (IRR (95% CI)=1.09 (1.01 to 1.17), p=0.01), but a decrease following the introduction of the PND audits (IRR (95% CI)=0.35 (0.22 to 0.56), p<0.001), when overdispersion was included. The CFR for prematurity showed a downward trend over time (IRR (95% CI)=0.94 (0.88 to 0.99), p=0.04) but not for the intervention. With regards CFRs for intrapartum-related hypoxia or infection, no statistically significant effect was detected for either time or the intervention. CONCLUSION The introduction of PND audit showed no statistically significant effect on perinatal mortality or stillbirth rate, but a significant decrease in early neonatal mortality rate. No effect was detected on CFRs for prematurity, intrapartum-related hypoxia or infections. These findings should encourage more research to assess the effectiveness of PND reviews on perinatal deaths in general, but also on stillbirths and neonatal deaths in particular, in low-resource settings.","output":"Prospective study to explore changes in quality of care and perinatal outcomes after implementation of perinatal death audit in Uganda."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: this study aimed to determine the proportion of people living with HIV (PLWH) with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a large sample from a single HIV referral center in Rome, Italy; the time-frame included both the first and the second wave of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic; Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study on stored cryopreserved samples from 1 March 2020 to 30 November 2020.

The study population consisted of all major trauma patients of all age groups admitted to Christchurch Hospital over three 33-day periods: before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand. Broadly speaking, major trauma is defined as having an injury severity score ?13 or death following injury. RESULTS There was a 42% reduction in the volume of major trauma admissions during lockdown. Falls were the most common injury during lockdown, and transport-related injuries after lockdown. Alcohol intoxication was associated with 19 to 33% of all injuries across the study periods. CONCLUSION Major trauma inevitably occurred during lockdown, although at considerably lower volumes. After lockdown, once restrictions were eased, major trauma admissions reverted to pre-lockdown patterns. Injury prevention strategies can reduce avoidable pressures on hospitals at a time of pandemic.

In South Africa, the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown have highlighted the shortcomings in the protection and care of children. Children in alternative care are particularly at risk as a result of disrupted and uncoordinated service delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and impact of the pandemic and the resulting social isolation on the wellbeing and protection of children living in a residential care facility. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: We used qualitative, participatory approaches - specifically draw-and-write methods - to engage with 32 children (average age = 13.5 years) living in a residential care facility in Gauteng. FINDINGS: Children in care demonstrated an awareness of the socio-economic difficulties facing communities in South Africa, and shared deep concerns about the safety, well-being and welfare of parents and siblings. Although they expressed frustration at the lack of contact with family members, they acknowledged the resources they had access to in a residential care facility, which enabled them to cope and which ensured their safety. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We focus our discussion on the necessity of a systemic response to child welfare, including a coordinated approach by policy makers, government departments and child welfare systems to address the structural factors at the root of inequality and inadequate, unacceptable care. This response is essential not only during COVID-19 but also in pre- and post-pandemic context.","output":"'When will I be free': Lessons from COVID-19 for Child Protection in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is a scarcity of research concerning what it is about arts engagement that may activate causal mechanisms leading to effects on health and wellbeing: their active ingredients. Further, the limited studies that do exist have tended to be relevant to specific contexts and types of art forms. The aim of this study was to carry out a comprehensive mapping of potential active ingredients, construct a shared language, and propose a framework and toolkit to support the design, implementation, and evaluation of arts in health activities. Methods: Drawing upon Rapid Appraisal techniques and collaborating with 64 participants working in arts in health, we engaged in a three-phase process: 1) scoping review to inform the development of an initial framework; 2) consultation on the initial framework; and 3) analysis and construction of the INNATE framework. Results: The study identified 139 potential active ingredients within the overarching categories of project, people, and contexts. Project components relate directly to the content of the arts activity itself, intrinsic to what the activity is. The people category denotes how people interact through engagement with the activity and who is involved in this interaction, including activity facilitation. Contexts relates to the activity setting comprising the aggregate of place(s), things, and surroundings. Aligning with complexity science, ingredients may interconnect or feed into one another to prompt mechanisms, and may not be experienced as distinct by participants. Conclusions: Our mapping exercise is the most extensive to date. In relation to arts in health activities, the INNATE framework can support with: design and implementation, such as co-producing an intervention to meet the needs of a particular population; evaluation, such as facilitating the comparison of different interventions and their efficacy; and replication, scalability, and sustainability through enabling detailed reporting and articulation of what an arts in health activity entails.","output":"What are the active ingredients of arts in health activities?

This research examined the feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of delivering a 6-week yoga-based meditation intervention to clinical teams of hospice professionals (HPs) at a large non-profit hospice organization. The intervention was designed to increase mind-body integration and combat burnout. This article was written for different audiences, including research scientists who study interoception, burnout, meditation, or yoga, designers of meditation interventions, and hospice organizations looking for ways to mitigate HP burnout. (2) Methods. The intervention was launched within clinical teams, beginning with a half-hour online introduction to the program and exposure to the week 1 meditation at each team's monthly all-staff meeting. Throughout the program, HPs could access the meditations on their own via their workplace computers, tablets, and smartphones. Online pre- and post-intervention surveys were submitted by 151 HPs, 76 of whom were exposed to the intervention and completed both surveys. The surveys assessed burnout using the Professional Fulfillment Index and mind-body integration using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness scales. (3) Results. Two-thirds of HPs who were present at a staff meeting where the program was introduced went on to do a meditation on their own at least once. Half of HPs expressed a desire to continue with access to the meditations after the 6-week program ended. Due to COVID-19 work from home restrictions, three-fourth of HPs did a meditation at home, 29% in a car between patient visits (not while driving), and 23% at the office. Higher interoceptive awareness was significantly related to lower burnout, particularly lower work exhaustion. Meditation frequency was significantly related to higher interoceptive awareness but not to burnout. Interpersonal disengagement was rare and temporary. (4) Conclusions. Findings showed that the yoga-based meditation intervention was feasible and acceptable and associated with higher interoceptive awareness.

AIMS To assess the suitability of current patient-level economic models to estimate long-term economic outcomes in severe mental illness. METHOD We undertook pre-specified systematic searches in MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to identify reviews and stand-alone publications of economic models of interventions for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (PROSPERO: CRD42020158243). We screened paper titles and abstracts to identify unique patient-level economic models. We conducted a structured extraction of identified models, recording the presence of key predefined model features. Model quality and validation were appraised using the 2014 ISPOR and 2016 AdViSHE model checklists. RESULTS We identified 15 unique patient-level models for psychosis and major depressive disorder from 1481 non-duplicate records. Models addressed schizophrenia (n = 6), bipolar disorder (n = 2) and major depressive disorder (n = 7). The predominant model type was discrete event simulation (n = 9). Model complexity and incorporation of patient heterogeneity varied considerably, and only five models extrapolated costs and outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Key model parameters were often based on low-quality evidence, and checklist quality assessment revealed weak model verification procedures. CONCLUSIONS Existing patient-level economic models of interventions for severe mental illness have considerable limitations. New modelling efforts must be supplemented by the generation of good-quality, contemporary evidence suitable for model building.

The FPDE was revised from a commercial bio-potential electrode with a conductive snap using dry electrodes rather than wet electrodes that proposed reliable and robust attachment for the purpose of measurement, and attaching velcro made it wearable on the forearm for bio-potential applications. Furthermore, this study proposes a recording device to store bio-potential signal data and provides portability and low-power consumption for the proposed acquisition system. To acquire differential bio-potentials, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, the proposed recording device includes a low-power front-end acquisition chip fabricated using a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, a commercial microcontroller (MSP430F149), and a secure digital (SD) card for portable healthcare applications. The proposed system can obtain ECG signals efficiently and are comfortable to the skin. The power consumption of the system is about 85 mW for continuous working over a 3 day period with two AA batteries.

Inclusion criteria were all patients undergoing operative intervention for an emergency or urgent trauma admission within our Trauma and Orthopaedics department. Data collected included anatomical area of injury, cause of injury, operative procedure, type of anaesthesia, total theatre time, complications, and mortality at 30 days. Results A total of 159 operations were performed on 142 patients in April 2019, and 110 operations on 106 patients in April 2020 (time of national lockdown). There was a 30% decrease due to reduced numbers of road traffic accidents and sport-related injuries. The number of hip fractures and those injuring themselves from less than 2m height remained the same. Operative total theatre time increased by a mean of 14 minutes, and complications and mortality were not significantly changed. The incidence of COVID in the patients tested was 8.5%, which matched the population incidence at the time. Conclusions Orthopaedic trauma services need to be provided during a national lockdown. There was no decrease in the volume of patients sustaining falls, which includes hip fractures. Mean operating time only increases by 14 minutes with the wearing of PPE.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use machine learning to construct a model for the analysis of risk factors and prediction of mortality among ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, 123 patients with COVID-19 in the ICU of Vulcan Hill Hospital were retrospectively selected from the database, and the data were randomly divided into a training data set (n=98) and test data set (n=25) with a 4:1 ratio. Significance tests, correlation analysis, and factor analysis were used to screen 100 potential risk factors individually. Conventional logistic regression methods and four machine learning algorithms were used to construct the risk prediction model for the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. The performance of these machine learning models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Interpretation and evaluation of the risk prediction model were performed using calibration curves, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), etc, to ensure its stability and reliability. The outcome was based on the ICU deaths recorded from the database. RESULTS: Layer-by-layer screening of 100 potential risk factors finally revealed 8 important risk factors that were included in the risk prediction model: lymphocyte percentage, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, eosinophil percentage, creatinine, neutrophil percentage, and albumin level. Finally, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model established with the 8 important risk factors showed the best recognition ability in the training set of 5-fold cross validation (AUC=0.86) and the verification queue (AUC=0.92). The calibration curve showed that the risk predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual risk. In addition, using the SHAP and LIME algorithms, feature interpretation and sample prediction interpretation algorithms of the XGBoost black box model were implemented. Additionally, the model was translated into a web-based risk calculator that is freely available for public usage. CONCLUSIONS: The 8-factor XGBoost model predicts risk of death in ICU patients with COVID-19 well; it initially demonstrates stability and can be used effectively to predict COVID-19 prognosis in ICU patients.","output":"Prognostic Assessment of COVID-19 in the Intensive Care Unit by Machine Learning Methods: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine is witnessing a rebirth due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing need for limited-contact or contactless care in medicine Telerehabilitation, an offshoot of telemedicine, is a valuable yet underexplored tool in the therapeutic armamentarium of patients with neurological conditions, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD) Although there is evidence in literature reporting the use of telerehabilitation and virtual reality-based services in providing rehabilitation to improve speech, swallowing, gait, and postural instability among persons with PD, the evidence is limited due to small patient numbers Teleneurorehabilitation (TNR) is an underutilized strategy that may be as effective and perhaps more feasible and affordable among Indian PD patients and also allows sustained rehabilitation In this article, we encapsulate the evidence on the utility and efficacy of TNR among persons with PD and call upon the neurology community to recognize and utilize the valuable asset that TNR may be for PD patients","output":"Teleneurorehabilitation for Parkinson's Disease: A Panacea for the Times to Come?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a serious public health emergency, especially for susceptible individuals and communities, including health care workers, patients with chronic infections, and pregnant females Generally, pregnant females are more vulnerable to respiratory infections Primary literature on the relationship between COVID-19 and pregnancy was collected from the PubMed, NCBI, and Google Scholar databases and a Google web search The relevant articles, including a few articles related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), were carefully reviewed and included in this comprehensive report The comparison of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 showed that maternal mortality and neonatal complications were more frequent in SARS and MERS than in COVID-19 The delivery outcomes of COVID-19-infected mothers were found to be better than those of mothers infected with SARS or MERS No study has reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, placenta tissue, umbilical cord blood, gastric juice, or the mother's milk Only one case report exists of a neonate being born with COVID-19 from an infected mother The current clinical research data indicate that COVID-19 has low adverse effects on pregnancy and fetal health No study supports vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus Delivery via caesarean section has been found to be significantly safer than vaginal delivery It is necessary to investigate congenital diseases in neonates at a large scale, and it is important to collect data from pregnant females and fetuses to ensure the health and safety of mothers and neonates","output":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 and its impact on pregnancy and neonates.

It stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, which affects the lungs. The process of replication and progression of the COVID-19 virus causes the formation of an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Many studies have been carried out that have demonstrated that hydrogen has strong anti-inflammatory properties. It reduces hypotension and other symptoms by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxygen mixture, enriched with Hydrogen, - helps to reduce the resistance of the respiratory tract and frees up access to the pulmonary alveolus, which improves the penetration of oxygen into the lungs. Since hydrogen is an antioxidant, it helps to reduce the burden on the immune system, helps to maintain the body's health and its ability to quickly recover. When electrolysers are used to produce an oxygen-hydrogen mixture, alkaline mist and other impurities can enter the patient's lungs and cause poisoning and chemical burns. For this reason, the use of atomic hydrogen obtained from metal hydride sources for ventilation of the lungs will be more effective for treating COVID-19 than a molecular hydrogen-oxygen mixture from an electrolyzer.

Analyses were stratified by gender, age group and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintile.Findings: In April 2020, primary care-recorded incident depression reduced by 436% (95% CI 390% to 479%), anxiety disorders by 482% (CI 446% to 515%) and antidepressant prescribing by 362% (CI 337% to 386%) compared to expected rates based on prior trends. Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were particularly stark for working-age adults and patients registered at practices in more deprived areas. Self-harm incidence was 385% (CI 357% to 413%) lower than expected in April 2020. Total self-harm contacts fell by 282% (CI 255% to 308%).

In this study we assessed the reliability and reproducibility of a simplified creatinine index (SCI) as a surrogate marker of MM and explored its predictive value on outcome. METHOD: We included all in-centre HD patients from 16 European countries with at least one SCI. The baseline period was defined as 30 days before and after the first multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy measurement; the subsequent 7 years constituted the follow-up. SCI was calculated by the Canaud equation. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were applied to assess the association of SCI with all-cause mortality. Using backward analysis, we explored the trends of SCI before death. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to analyse the agreement between estimated and measured MM. RESULTS: We included 23 495 HD patients; 3662 were incident. Females and older patients have lower baseline SCI. Higher SCI was associated with a lower risk of mortality [hazard ratio 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.82)]. SCI decline accelerated a5-7 months before death.

There are two commonly discussed mechanisms by which biodiversity loss could increase rates of infectious disease in a landscape. First, loss of competitors or predators could facilitate an increase in the abundance of competent reservoir hosts. Second, biodiversity loss could disproportionately affect non-competent, or less competent reservoir hosts, which would otherwise interfere with pathogen transmission to human populations by, for example, wasting the bites of infected vectors. A negative association between biodiversity and disease risk, sometimes called the \\"dilution effect hypothesis,\\" has been supported for a few disease agents, suggests an exciting win-win outcome for the environment and society, and has become a pervasive topic in the disease ecology literature. Case studies have been assembled to argue that the dilution effect is general across disease agents. Less touted are examples in which elevated biodiversity does not affect or increases infectious disease risk for pathogens of public health concern. In order to assess the likely generality of the dilution effect, we review the association between biodiversity and public health across a broad variety of human disease agents. Overall, we hypothesize that conditions for the dilution effect are unlikely to be met for most important diseases of humans. Biodiversity probably has little net effect on most human infectious diseases but, when it does have an effect, observation and basic logic suggest that biodiversity will be more likely to increase than to decrease infectious disease risk.","output":"Does biodiversity protect humans against infectious disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Renal stone disease is common and can cause emergency presentation with acute pain due to ureteric colic. International guidelines have stated the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether a non-invasive outpatient (shockwave lithotripsy [SWL]) or surgical (ureteroscopy [URS]) intervention should be the first-line treatment for those needing active intervention. This has implications for shaping clinical pathways. OBJECTIVE: To report a pragmatic multicentre non-inferiority RCT comparing SWL with URS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This trial tested for non-inferiority of up to two sessions of SWL compared with URS as initial treatment for ureteric stones requiring intervention. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was whether further intervention was required to clear the stone, and secondary outcomes included quality of life assessment, severity of pain, and serious complications; these were based on questionnaires at baseline, 8 wk, and 6 mo. We included patients over 16 yr with a single ureteric stone clinically deemed to require intervention. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were planned. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The study recruited between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2017. We recruited 613 participants from a total of 1291 eligible patients, randomising 306 to SWL and 307 to URS. Sixty-seven patients (22.1%) in the SWL arm needed further treatment compared with 31 patients (10.3%) in the URS arm. The absolute risk difference was 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6%, 17.8%) in favour of URS, which was inside the 20% threshold we set for demonstrating noninferiority of SWL. CONCLUSIONS: This RCT was designed to test whether SWL is non-inferior to URS and confirmed this; although SWL is an outpatient noninvasive treatment with potential advantages both for patients and for reducing the use of inpatient health care resources, the trial showed a benefit in overall clinical outcomes with URS compared with SWL, reflecting contemporary practice. The Therapeutic Interventions for Stones of the Ureter (TISU) study provides new evidence to help guide the choice of modality for this common health condition. PATIENT SUMMARY: We present the largest trial comparing ureteroscopy versus extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for ureteric stones. While ureteroscopy had marginally improved outcome in terms of stone clearance, as expected, shockwave lithotripsy had better results in terms of health care costs. These results should enable patients and health care providers to optimise treatment pathways for this common urological condition.","output":"Shockwave Lithotripsy Versus Ureteroscopic Treatment as Therapeutic Interventions for Stones of the Ureter (TISU): A Multicentre Randomised Controlled Non-inferiority Trial [Image: see text] ()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN La artritis psorisica (APs) es una forma comn de artritis inflamatoria que aparece hasta en el 40% de los pacientes con psoriasis.

ABSTRACT Psoriatic arthritis is a common type of inflammatory arthritis found in 40% of patients with psoriasis. Because skin involvement usually precedes joint involvement, dermatologists play a key role in early detection. Early diagnosis is important for reducing the risk of irreversible structural damage, attenuating the deterioration of physical function, and improving patients quality of life. This consensus statement was drafted by a group of 9 dermatologists and 1 rheumatologist to provide simple recommendations to help dermatologists screen for psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary referral center between July and September 2020. A female talker recorded sentences in three conditions: no face covering, N95 mask, and N95 mask plus a face shield. Spectral differences were analyzed between speech produced in each condition. The speech recognition in each condition for twenty-three adult patients with at least 6 months of cochlear implant use was assessed. RESULTS: Spectral analysis demonstrated preferential attenuation of high-frequency speech information with the N95 mask plus face shield condition compared to the other conditions. Speech recognition did not differ significantly between the uncovered (median 90% [IQR 89%-94%]) and N95 mask conditions (91% [IQR 86%-94%]; P = .253); however, speech recognition was significantly worse in the N95 mask plus face shield condition (64% [IQR 48%-75%]) compared to the uncovered (P < .001) or N95 mask (P < .001) conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The type and combination of protective face coverings used have differential effects on attenuation of speech information, influencing speech recognition of patients with hearing loss. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to protect patients and clinicians from spread of disease while maximizing patient speech recognition. The disruptive effect of wearing a face shield in conjunction with a mask may prompt clinicians to consider alternative eye protection, such as goggles, in appropriate clinical situations.

These are based on the number of excess deaths attributed either directly or indirectly to the epidemic. Unfortunately the data on which such comparisons rely are often incomplete and unreliable. This article discusses problems of interpretation of data even when the data is largely accurate and delayed by at most two to three weeks. This applies to the Office of National Statistics in the UK, the Statistisches Bundesamt in Germany and the Belgian statistical office Statbel. The data in the article is taken from these three sources. The number of excess deaths is defined as the number of deaths minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to country. In the UK it is the average number of deaths over the last five years, in Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium over the last 11 years. This means that in all cases the individual baselines depend strongly on the timing and intensity of adverse factors such as past influenza epidemics and heat waves. This makes cross-country comparisons difficult. A baseline defined as the number the number of deaths in the absence of adverse factors can be operationalized by taking say the 10\\\\% quantile of the number of deaths. This varies little over time and European countries within given age groups. It therefore enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries. The article criticizes the use of Z-scores which distort the comparison between countries.

Recent epidemiological data show that Black communities are being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, resulting in higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to other racial and ethnic groups. For Black women in particular, a long-standing history of systemic racism and marginalization has resulted in increased vulnerability and susceptibility to certain adverse health outcomes. Recent data show that COVID-19 knowledge rates among Black participants are low, and that Black women who become infected with COVID-19 have higher risks of complications and mortality compared to their non-Black counterparts. Given this data, there is a need to explore where and how Black women are obtaining information that pertains to COVID-19, along with the impacts that COVID-19 may be having on their daily lives. DESIGN We conducted interviews with 15 Black women who are clients at a community-based family service center to assess their understanding of COVID-19, determine how they were obtaining COVID-19 information, and evaluate the various impacts that COVID-19 was having on their lives. An initial codebook was developed based on the recorded interviews which included deductive and inductive codes. A thematic analysis of the data was then conducted using MaxQDA (Verbi Software), focusing on Black women's experiences related to COVID-19. RESULTS The majority of participants were using a combination of social media platforms and news sources to obtain information about COVID-19. Most participants (79%) expressed confusion, misunderstanding, and mistrust of the information that they were receiving about COVID-19.

Another drug that inhibits receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), which functions downstream of NOD2, also decreased the replication of these pathogenic RNA viruses. The antiviral effect of this drug was particularly potent against enteroviruses.

However, conferences carry an ecological footprint due to greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, traditional conference formats have recently not been possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein we examine the carbon footprint associated with travel by presenting delegates to the fall SPU conferences from 2013 to 2019, and the 2015 ESPU conference. METHODS: Online programs for the targeted SPU Fall meetings and the 2015 ESPU Annual Meeting were retrospectively reviewed. Variables collected included meeting location and presenter home base. Distance traveled by the presenter, and likely CO(2)e of this return trip were estimated using online calculators. Analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis-H test with pairwise comparisons to detect differences in round trip distances and CO(2)e between meeting locations. RESULTS: Six fall SPU conferences and one ESPU conference were reviewed. The majority of presenters were from the region (North America and Europe respectively), for both SPU and ESPU. The median round trip distance was 2596.34 miles (IQR 1420.96C4438.30), and the median CO(2)e 0.61 metric tons (IQR 0.36C1.02). We found that the distances traveled to conferences in the Western USA and Europe were slightly further than those to conferences in Central Canada and the Southern US. The difference in CO(2)e between these locations did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Presenter travel to and from pediatric urological conferences generates an important carbon footprint and may not be possible in the medium-term future due to a global pandemic.

This clinical study aims to: 1. characterize the type, location and intensity of pain in myeloma patients, and its effect of quality of life, and 2. investigate whether the nerve fibers in the bone of myeloma patients are altered. We will also explore whether pain intensity is correlated to blood indicators of inflammation or bone damage. Study results will help identify the mechanisms of myeloma-induced bone pain, allowing the development of new analgesics for these patients. ABSTRACT: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a bone marrow neoplasia that causes bone pain in 70% patients. While preclinical models of MM have suggested that both nerve sprouting and nerve injury may be causative for the pain, there is a lack of clinical data. Thus, the primary aims of this clinical study are: (1) to provide a deep characterization of the subjective experience of pain and quality of life in MM patients; (2) to investigate disturbances in the bone innervation of MM patients. Secondary aims include exploring correlations between pain and serum inflammatory and bone turnover biomarkers. In a prospective, observational study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04273425), patients with suspected MM requiring a diagnostic iliac crest biopsy at Sheffield Teaching Hospital (UK) are invited to participate. Consenting patients answer seven standardized questionnaires assessing pain, quality of life and catastrophizing. Bone turnover biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines are measured in fasting serum samples, and bone innervation is evaluated in diagnostic biopsies. MM patients are invited to a follow-up upon completion of first line treatment. This will be the first deep characterization of pain in MM patients and its correlation with disturbances in bone innervation. Understanding how bone turnover and inflammation correlate to pain in MM is crucial to identify novel analgesic targets for this condition.","output":"Bone Pain in Multiple Myeloma (BPMM)A Protocol for a Prospective, Longitudinal, Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first case of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

Data specific to the differences in clinical features and geographic distribution between S. notomytis infection and S. moniliformis infection are scarce. All previous cases of human S. notomytis infection were reported from Japan. This is the first case of S. notomytis infection reported from outside of Japan. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old Thai woman was admitted to Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand)-Thailand's largest university-based national tertiary referral center-in August 2020 with fever, myalgia, and polyarthralgia for 3 days, and gradually decreased consciousness for the past 1 day. Physical examination and laboratory investigations revealed septic arthritis of both knee joints, meningitis, and hepatitis. She was initially misdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly since the initial investigations were unable to detect a causative pathogen. However, S. notomytis infection was later confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a part of the 16S rRNA gene and sequencing from synovial fluid. Her clinical course was also complicated by spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess caused by S. notomytis, which was detected from tissue biopsy. Therefore, rat bite fever in this patient manifested as meningitis, septic polyarthritis, hepatitis, and spondylodiscitis. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone then switched to oral amoxicillin with complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of S. notomytis infection are similar to those demonstrated in S. moniliformis infection.

For a period of twenty years starting around 2002, Open Society Foundations (OSF) supported palliative care pioneers in the region to establish palliative care services, train health providers, and advocate for the integration into health services. OBJECTIVES: To report on the development of palliative care in Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine during the period 2017-2021 and explore the impact of OSF's sustained funding for palliative care in these countries. Activities and developments to 2017 were described in country-specific papers in 2018. METHODS: A retrospective case study analysis was used to examine how palliative care developed in each country. We reviewed theories of change, funding and advocacy strategies, implemented activities and interventions, and their outputs and outcomes, and compared them to legal, policy and service developments in practice. RESULTS: By the mid-2010s, each country had laid the foundations for rolling out palliative care-basic policies and guidelines were in place; palliative care medications were available; key health providers were trained; and training capacity and models of care had been created-but service availability remained limited. In subsequent years, advocates increasingly embraced public advocacy to hold governments accountable for meeting their commitments and to include palliative care in universal health insurance. By 2021, Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine had significantly scaled up service availability and palliative care was firmly embedded in universal health coverage in Moldova and Ukraine whereas progress in Georgia and Tajikistan was more modest. CONCLUSION: Experiences in these countries suggest that a strategy that initially emphasizes training, technical assistance, and engagement to create the building blocks for palliative care combined with or followed by public advocacy and campaigning to demand roll out of services can result in significant advances.

The second simulation aimed to assess transfer skills, communication and teamwork performance, that participants had learnt using a validated, comprehensive assessment tool. Data were analysed using unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The HFS group showed significantly better overall transfer and communication skills than LFS group (89.704.65 vs 77.193.6, <0.05 and 100 vs 88.34 (63.33C100), p=0.022, respectively). The HFS group also demonstrated significantly better teamwork performance than the standard LFS group (90 (80C900) vs 80 (70C90), p=0.028). CONCLUSION: In situ simulation training using HFS significantly showed better performance than the standard training using LFS in regards to overall transfer and communication skills as well as teamwork performance. The training using HFS may provide a valuable adjunct to improve interprofessional skills, communication and teamwork performance in transferring critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Coronaviruses are known to affect the cardiovascular system. We review the basics of coronaviruses, with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system. Observations Coronavirus disease 2019 can cause a viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications. A large proportion of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors. Factors associated with mortality include male sex, advanced age, and presence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is also strongly associated with mortality. Conclusions and Relevance Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a high inflammatory burden that can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Extensive efforts are underway to find specific vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

Respiratory droplets and contaction with infected patients are the two major transmission routes. However, the value of tear virus nucleic acid is still not clear. We dynamic detected the SARS-CoV-2 in eye sample of one COVID-19 patient with obstruction of common lacrimal ducts. METHODS: Besides the routine examination, nasopharyngeal and eye swab were continuously measured by polymerase chain reaction assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Gene detection was performed for drug use guidance, and flow cytometry was performed to analyse the lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for 22 days, but eye swabs were still continuously positive for 2 weeks after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative. The low level of lymphocyte and the high level IL-6 lasted for almost 4 weeks, then became near normal. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the existing of SARS-CoV-2, HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid. The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T>C) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased. The flow cytometry of lymphocyte subsets showed PD-1+ CD95+ cells was accounting for 94.8% in CD3+ CD8+ T subset and for 94.8% in CD3+ TCR?3?+ T subset.

Mothers with infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) face additional risk for PPD, coupled with risk factors extending beyond a NICU admision a NICU admission. The novelty of this review is the focus on maternal PPD for mothers with infants admitted to the NICU. Interventions aimed at limiting and preventing PPD in this population include: prenatal and postpartum PPD screening, PPD symptom awareness and monitoring, and trauma-informed care. RECENT FINDINGS PPD, the most frequent complication of childbirth, affects approximately 10-15% of mothers worldwide. Prevalence rates increase to 40% for mothers whose infant is admitted to the NICU. PPD can affect maternal and child health across the life course and predispose future generations. Prevalence rates are higher for racial and ethnic minorities, immigrant and refugee populations, and mothers in rural locations. Trauma-informed care is suggested at individual and organizational levels, leading to better care for those with and without a trauma history. SUMMARY Increasing PPD symptom awareness, screening for PPD, and connections with resources should begin during prenatal visits.

Secondary aims were to: (1) determine if screen use was associated with individual EDI domains scores, and (2) examine the association between screen use and EDI domains scores among a subgroup of high screen users. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was carried out using data from young children participating in a large primary care practice-based research network in Canada. Logistic regression analyses were run to investigate the association between screen use and overall vulnerability in school readiness. Separate linear regression models examined the relationships between childrens daily screen use and each separate continuous EDI domain. RESULTS: A total of 876 Canadian participants participated in this study. Adjusted logistic regression revealed an association between increased screen use and increased vulnerability in school readiness (p = 0.05). Results from adjusted linear regression demonstrated an association between higher screen use and reduced language and cognitive development domain scores (p = 0.004).

However, in the cultural context, many patients are unnecessarily referred for circumcision for physiological phimosis (adhesions). Due to parental concerns and misperceptions by general practitioners, non-retractile prepuce is one of the most common indications for referral to a paediatric surgeon in many countries. This study aimed to determine whether preputial adhesiolysis successfully managed symptomatic non-retractile foreskin and therefore prevented the need for circumcision. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of the health records of children who presented with preputial adhesion. We included 65 symptomatic patients (ballooning of the prepuce in all cases and additional dysuria in three cases) who underwent preputial adhesiolysis. All cases were followed up for 2 years. Circumcision was subsequently carried out for patients who developed fibrous scarring resulting in difficult retraction due to the development of thick adhesions or skin fissuring with persistence of symptoms. Results: Of the 65 boys, 58 (89.2%) achieved complete retraction of the prepuce. The remaining 7 boys (10.8%) presented with recurring symptoms and thick fibrosed prepuce, and they underwent circumcision due to the dense adhesions. Histopathological examination of the circumcised prepuces revealed balanitis xerotica obliterans in two cases. Conclusion: Preputial adhesiolysis is a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic preputial adhesions in boys younger than 5 years old. The procedure avoids circumcision and its associated risks.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ROTEM values reflected an increase in clot strength for the EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM assays beyond the reference range. No hyperfibrinolysis was noted. Fibrinolysis shutdown was present but did not correlate with thrombosis. 32% (14/44) of patients experienced a thrombotic episode. For every 1 mm increase of FIBTEM maximum clot formation (MCF), the odds of developing thrombosis increased 20% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0-40%, p=0.043), whereas for every 1,000 ng/mL increase in D-dimer, the odds of thrombosis increased by 70% (95% CI, 20%-150%, p=0.004), after adjustment for age and sex (AUC 0.96, 95% CI, 0.90 - 1.00). There was a slight, but significant improvement in model performance after adding FIBTEM MCF and EXTEM clot formation time (CFT) to D-dimer in a multivariable model (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer concentrations were more predictive of thrombosis in our patient population than any other parameter. ROTEM confirmed the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 intensive care unit patients. FIBTEM MCF and EXTEM CFT increased the predictability for thrombosis compared to only using D-dimer. ROTEM analysis is most useful in augmenting the information provided by the D-dimer concentration for VTE risk assessment when the D-dimer concentration is between 1,625-6,900 ng/dL, but the enhancement is modest.

Empirical studies that use microfluidic chemotaxis-chip devices with two opposing chemoattractants showed differential neutrophil migration after challenge with different LPS doses. The epigenetic alterations responsible for changes in neutrophil migratory behavior are unknown. We developed two mathematical models that evaluate the mechanistic interactions responsible for neutrophil migratory decision-making when exposed to competing chemoattractants and challenged with LPS. The first model, which considers the interactions between the receptor densities of two competing chemoattractants, their kinases, and LPS, displayed bistability between high and low ratios of primary to intermediary chemoattractant receptor densities. In particular, at equilibrium, we observe equal receptor densities for low LPS (< 15ng/mL); and dominance of receptors for the primary chemoattractant for high LPS (> 15ng/mL). The second model, which included additional interactions with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms, has an additional dynamic outcome, oscillatory dynamics for both receptors, as seen in the data. In particular, it found equal receptor densities in the absence of oscillation for super-low and high LPS challenge (< 0.4 and 1.1 <LPS< 375 ng/mL); equal receptor densities with oscillatory receptor dynamics for super-low LPS (0.5 < LPS< 1.1ng/mL); and dominance of receptors for the primary chemoattractant for super-high LPS (>376 ng/mL).

METHODS: An invitation to participate in a retrospective study was distributed globally to scientific, medical, and patient societies involved in the care and advocacy for patients with IEI. RESULTS: We gathered information on 94 patients with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their median age was 25 to 34 years. Fifty-three patients (56%) suffered from primary antibody deficiency, 9 (9.6%) had immune dysregulation syndrome, 6 (6.4%) a phagocyte defect, 7 (7.4%) an autoinflammatory disorder, 14 (15%) a combined immunodeficiency, 3 (3%) an innate immune defect, and 2 (2%) bone marrow failure. Ten were asymptomatic, 25 were treated as outpatients, 28 required admission without intensive care or ventilation, 13 required noninvasive ventilation or oxygen administration, 18 were admitted to intensive care units, 12 required invasive ventilation, and 3 required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine patients (7 adults and 2 children) died. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that (1) more than 30% of patients with IEI had mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and (2) risk factors predisposing to severe disease/mortality in the general population also seemed to affect patients with IEI, including more younger patients. Further studies will identify pathways that are associated with increased risk of severe disease and are nonredundant or redundant for protection against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with inborn errors of immunity: An international study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A genetically encoded caffeine-operated synthetic module (COSMO) is introduced herein as a robust chemically induced dimerization (CID) system COSMO enables chemogenetic manipulation of biological processes by caffeine and its metabolites, as well as caffeinated beverages, including coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks This CID tool, evolved from an anti-caffeine nanobody via cell-based high-throughput screening, permits caffeine-inducible gating of calcium channels, tumor killing via necroptosis, growth factors-independent activation of tyrosine receptor kinase signaling, and enhancement of nanobody-mediated antigen recognition for the severe acute respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein Further rationalized engineering of COSMO leads to 34C217-fold enhancement in caffeine sensitivity (EC50 = 16 9 nanomolar), which makes it among the most potent CID systems like the FK506 binding protein (FKBP)CFKBP rapamycin binding domain (FRB)Crapamycin complex Furthermore, bivalent COSMO (biCOMSO) connected with a long linker favors intramolecular dimerization and acts as a versatile precision switch when inserted in host proteins to achieve tailored function Given the modularity and high transferability of COMSO and biCOSMO, these chemical biology tools are anticipated to greatly accelerate the development of therapeutic cells and biologics that can be switched on and off by caffeinated beverages commonly consumed in the daily life ? 2020 The Authors Published by Wiley-VCH GmbH","output":"Caffeine-Operated Synthetic Modules for Chemogenetic Control of Protein Activities by Life Style"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is the most feared infectious cause of death in cats, induced by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). This coronavirus is a virulent mutant of the harmless, ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). To date, feline coronavirus (FCoV) research has been hampered by the lack of susceptible cell lines for the propagation of serotype I FCoVs. In this study, long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures were established from primary ileocytes and colonocytes by simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen- and human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT)-induced immortalization. Subsequently, these cultures were evaluated for their usability in FCoV research. Firstly, the replication capacity of the serotype II strains WSU 79C1683 and WSU 79C1146 was studied in the continuous cultures as was done for the primary cultures. In accordance with the results obtained in primary cultures, FCoV WSU 79C1683 still replicated significantly more efficient compared to FCoV WSU 79C1146 in both continuous cultures. In addition, the cultures were inoculated with faecal suspensions from healthy cats and with faecal or tissue suspensions from FIP cats. The cultures were susceptible to infection with different serotype I enteric strains and two of these strains were further propagated. No infection was seen in cultures inoculated with FIPV tissue homogenates. In conclusion, a new reliable model for FCoV investigation and growth of enteric field strains was established. In contrast to FIPV strains, FECVs showed a clear tropism for intestinal epithelial cells, giving an explanation for the observation that FECV is the main pathotype circulating among cats.","output":"Establishment of feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures for the propagation and study of feline enteric coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to identify the strategic topics and the thematic evolution structure of data mining applied to healthcare, in this paper, a bibliometric performance and network analysis (BPNA) was conducted.

In the presence of periodic modulation of the transmission rate, the dynamics varies from periodic to chaotic. The route to chaos is typically through period doubling bifurcation. There are coexisting attractors for some sets of parameters. However in the presence of quasiperiodic modulation, tori are created in place of periodic orbits and chaos appears via finite torus doublings. Strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) are created at the boundary of chaotic and torus dynamics. Multistability is found to be reduced as a function of quasiperiodic modulation strength. It is argued that occurrence of SNAs gives an opportunity of asymptotic predictability of epidemic growth even when the underlying dynamics is strange.","output":"Effects of quasiperiodic forcing in epidemic models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Morbidity and mortality rates show different patterns in European countries.

The term health diplomacy has been used to describe this growing interface between foreign policy and global health, and it encompasses both the concept of using health to further foreign policy objectives as well as the idea that diplomatic tools can be helpful for attaining public health goals. The Chinese presence in Africa has grown in the last 15 years, generating increased interest in Sino-African relations. While much has been written in recent years about the Chinese presence in Africa, the growing numbers of Africans in China have attracted considerably less attention. Many are small-scale traders and might be expected to face many of the health challenges common among foreign migrants, but their health needs have been largely unrecognised. In this paper, we consider how a health diplomacy approach could be applied to African migrants in China, and the potential advantages and limitations of this strategy. We identify areas of overlap between public health, trade and foreign policy goals that can be emphasised to generate support for improved services for African migrants in China and to engage partners from a diversity of sectors.","output":"Improving health services for African migrants in China: A health diplomacy perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies, have dramatically changed treatment strategies for several cancers. In pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies, experiments using a variety of animal species are assumed. We have identified optimal multiple reaction monitoring transitions for signature candidate peptides of nivolumab in human, mouse, and rat plasma and developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) using trastuzumab as the internal standard. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 1-200 g/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy in human plasma fulfilled Food and Drug Administration guideline criteria for bioanalytical validation. There was no need to change the measurement method in mouse plasma. On the other hand, in rat plasma, an interference peak was observed at a retention time similar to that of the surrogate peptide ASGITFSNSGMHWVR (550.75 > 661.50) employed in human and mouse plasma. Therefore, we confirmed that ASQSVSSYLAWYQQKPGQAPR (785.0 > 940.2) can be used as an alternate nivolumab surrogate peptide in rat plasma at the same concentration range as used in human and mouse plasma. Using our method, the concentration range and a gradual increase in trough value were confirmed in clinical samples from two antibody-treated patients, including one with gastric cancer and one with non-small-cell lung cancer. The time course and blood concentration transition also were evaluated in nivolumab administration experiments in mouse and rat. The present study showed that the selection of the optimal peptide is essential for accurate LC-MS/MS measurement of nivolumab concentration in human, mouse, and rat plasma.

Transanal TME (TaTME) was developed to improve oncological and functional outcomes of patients with mid and low rectal cancer. METHODS An international, multicentre, superiority, randomised trial was designed to compare TaTME and conventional laparoscopic TME as the surgical treatment of mid and low rectal carcinomas. The primary endpoint is involved CRM. Secondary endpoints include completeness of mesorectum, residual mesorectum, morbidity and mortality, local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival, percentage of sphincter-saving procedures, functional outcome and quality of life. A Quality Assurance Protocol including centralised MRI review, histopathology re-evaluation, standardisation of surgical techniques, and monitoring and assessment of surgical quality will be conducted.

Different diagnostic tools, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), lung ultrasound (LUS), and computerized tomography (CT), have been used to detect active pneumonic lesions associated with COVID-19 with their varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with a pneumonic lung lesion detected by CT that is not detected by CXR. A total of 156 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at three nationally designated South Korean hospitals with no active lesion detected by CXR but on clinical suspicion of pneumonia underwent the CT examination and were enrolled. Medical records, which included demographic and clinical features, including comorbidity, symptoms, radiological, and laboratory findings on admission, were reviewed and analyzed. The risk factors of pneumonia detected by CT for patients without an active lesion detected by CXR were investigated. Of the 156 patients without an active lesion detected by CXR, 35 (22.44%) patients were found to have pneumonia by CT. The patients with pneumonia defined by CT were older than those without (64.1 years vs. 41.2 years). Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, preexisting stroke, and dementia were more common among patients with pneumonia defined by CT than those without. Serum albumin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), stroke, and age &#8805; 70 years were significantly associated with pneumonia defined by CT after adjustment for age. In multivariable regression analysis, serum albumin level (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.123, 95% CI = (0.035-0.429)) and preexisting stroke (AOR = 11.447, 95% CI = (1.168-112.220)) significantly and independently predicted pneumonia detection by CT. Our results suggest that CT scans should be performed on COVID-19 patients negative for a pneumonic lung lesion by CXR who are suspected to be pneumonic on clinical grounds.

We observed that successful scale-up is a complex process of institutional reform. Successful scale-up: (1) depends on a carefully choreographed, problem-driven political process; (2) requires that scaled program models are drawn from solutions that are available in a given health system context and aligned with the resources, capabilities, and commitments of key health sector stakeholders; and (3) emerges from iterative cycles of learning and improvement, rather than a single, linear scale-up effort.

Meanings are generated from the perspective of hindsight, i.e. against the arrow of time. The same information can be differently interpreted by different system's parts (i,e,provided with different meanings) so that the number of options for possible system development is proliferated.

This unique organization is not found elsewhere in the nervous system. SGCs in sensory ganglia are activated by numerous types of nerve injury and inflammation. The activation includes upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein, stronger gap junction-mediated SGCCSGC and neuronCSGC coupling, increased sensitivity to ATP, downregulation of Kir4.1 potassium channels and increased cytokine synthesis and release. There is evidence that these changes in SGCs contribute to chronic pain by augmenting neuronal activity and that these changes are consistent in various rodent pain models and likely also in human pain. Therefore, understanding these changes and the resulting abnormal interactions of SGCs with sensory neurons could provide a mechanistic approach that might be exploited therapeutically in alleviation and prevention of pain. We describe how SGCs are altered in rodent models of four common types of pain: systemic inflammation (sickness behaviour), post-surgical pain, diabetic neuropathic pain and post-herpetic pain.","output":"Emerging importance of satellite glia in nervous system function and dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prosopis farcta (Banks & Sol.)

The COVAX Facility seeks to address this important issue, but the prevalence of vaccine nationalism threatens to limit the ability of the facility to meet both its funding targets and its ambitious goals for vaccine procurement. A failure to adequately address the underlying lack of infrastructure in developing countries threatens to further limit the success of the COVAX Facility. CONTEXT: Significant effort has been directed toward developing a COVID-19 vaccine, which is viewed as the route out of the pandemic. Much of this effort has coalesced around COVAX, the multilateral initiative aimed at accelerating the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and ensuring they are equitably available in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper represents the first significant analysis of COVAX, and the extent to which it can be said to have successfully met these aims. METHODS: This paper draws on the publicly available policy documents made available by the COVAX initiatives, as well as position papers and public statements from governments around the world with respect to COVID-19 vaccines and equitable access. We analyze the academic literature regarding access to vaccines during the H1N1 pandemic. Finally, we consider the WHO Global Allocation System, and its principles, which are intended to guide COVAX vaccine deployment. FINDINGS: We argue that the funding mechanism deployed by the COVAX Pillar appears to be effective at fostering at-risk investments in research and development and the production of doses in advance of confirmation of clinical efficacy, but caution that this represents a win-win situation for vaccine manufacturers, providing them with opportunity to benefit regardless of whether their vaccine candidate ever goes on to gain regulatory approval. We also argue that the success of the COVAX Facility with respect to equitable access to vaccine is likely to be limited, primarily as a result of the prevalence of vaccine nationalism, whereby countries adopt policies which heavily prioritize their own public health needs at the expense of others. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts through COVAX have greatly accelerated the development of vaccines against COVID-19, but these benefits are unlikely to flow to LMICs, largely due to the threat of vaccine nationalism.","output":"International Collaboration to Ensure Equitable Access to Vaccines for COVID-19: The ACT-Accelerator and the COVAX Facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.ekir.2020.07.010.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.ekir.2021.07.022.].","output":"Corrigendum to The Cumulative Rate of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Chinese Hemodialysis Patients [Kidney Int.

METHODS A multicenter, retrospective quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate provider response to CDS alerts triggered during ordering of QT-prolonging medications for adult patients. The primary outcome was the proportion of orders triggering QTc alerts that were continued without intervention during a specified preimplementation phase (n = 49) and during a postimplementation phase (n = 100). Patient risk factors for QTc prolongation, provider alert response, and interventions to reduce the risk of QTc-associated adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS The rate of order continuation without intervention was 82% in the preimplementation phase and 37% in the postimplementation phase, representing an 55% reduction in continued verified orders following implementation of the QT-focused CDS tool. Most alerts were initially responded to by the prescriber, with pharmacist intervention needed in only 33% of cases. There were no significant differences in patient QTc-related risk factors between the 2 study groups (P = 0.11); the postimplementation group had a higher proportion of patients using at least 2 QTc-prolonging medications (48%, compared to 26% in the preimplementation group; P = 0.02).

Our in-house produced HPL supported fibroblast growth at levels similar to those for FBS and commercial HPL products and was superior to AB human serum.

The HPL manufacturing process was validated within a GMP compliant system and the solution was stable at -80oC and -20oC for 2 years. Dermal fibroblasts expanded in vitro with HPL maintain a normal karyotype and expression of fibroblast markers, with only minor changes in their global gene expression profile.

These findings are that teachers and others base their ideas about teaching on the long apprenticeship of observation as students; they derive their satisfaction from the psychic rewards of teaching C the emotional satisfaction and feedback that teachers got from students; and they work in conservative cultures of individualism. Design/methodology/approach: The article appraises Lortie's foundational text in relation to contemporary public domain surveys and op-ed articles about the impact of the pandemic on teaching and learning. Findings: COVID-19 created conditions that undermined traditional psychic rewards, weakened the tenuous studentCteacher relationship as more students found schooling less engaging, began to give parents distorted observations of teaching online and made teacher collaboration more difficult. Research limitations/implications: Due to the current nature of the pandemic and the shortage of just-in-time original data, the research relies on rapid responses and op-ed perceptions rather than on an established body of literature and database. Practical implications: The postpandemic agenda holds out three ways to modernize Lortie's agenda in ways that advance the presence and impact of professional capital. These ways comprise new psychic rewards for students and not just teachers, a more open professionalism that is actively inclusive of parents and collaborative professionalism that has greater strength and depth.

METHODS: We conducted a 4 months prospective cohort study in the winter period 2014/2015 and recruited parents of children aged 0C6 years in 75 day care centers in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany. For all household members, we collected information on episodes of ARI and AGI. We applied prospective data collection in one study arm and retrospective data collection with a reporting period of 2 months in the other. Poisson regression was used to model monthly incidence rates for both study arms. RESULTS: In total, 100 households (including 404 persons) participated in the retrospective group and 77 households (282 persons) in the prospective group. Incidence estimates for ARI (retrospective group: 0.52 per person month, prospective group: 0.47) were higher than for AGI (retrospective group: 0.14, prospective group: 0.13). The adjusted incidence estimates were similar in both study arms for ARI (incidence rate ratio for retrospective versus prospective data collection: 1.11 [confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.99; 1.24], p = 0.42) as well as for AGI (1.10 [CI 95% 0.89; 1.37], p = 0.27).

Forty-three semi-structured interviews were carried out with 47 professionals (44 women and 3 men) from 40 different entities (September 2020April 2021). This content analysis suggests that the pandemic and its associated prevention measures have had a negative impact on women exposed to IPV and their children, which affected their social wellbeing. Professionals described burnout, difficult and slow administrative processes, and problems with coordination and access to information. These negative impacts were mitigated, in part, by the work of professionals, but this suggests that a series of key strategies are needed to improve the response capacity of the service sector to IPV in situations of crisis. These improvements are related to the availability of human and material resources; an efficient coordination network between the professionals from different sectors; existence of informal support networks in the community; protocols/procedures and prior training for better implementation; and greater flexibility and accessibility of basic services that benefit women who experience IPV.","output":"Coping with intimate partner violence and the COVID-19 lockdown: The perspectives of service professionals in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to understand the potential barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination among youth. METHODS: Open-ended questions regarding COVID-19 vaccination were posed to a national cohort of 14- to 24-year-olds (October 30, 2020). Responses were coded through qualitative thematic analysis. Multivariable logistic regression tested the association of demographic characteristics with vaccination unwillingness. RESULTS: Among 911 respondents (response rate = 79.4%), 75.9% reported willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 42.7% had unconditional willingness, and 33.3% were conditionally willing, of which the majority (80.7%) were willing if experts deemed vaccination safe and recommended. Preferred vaccine information sources were medical organizations (42.3%; CDC, WHO) and health care professionals (31.7%). Frequent concerns with vaccination included side effects (36.2%) and efficacy (20.1%). Race predicted vaccination unwillingness (Black: odds ratio = 3.31; and Asian: odds ratio = .46, compared with white, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Most youth in our national sample were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when they believe it is safe and recommended.

Robust, coordinated IgA and IgG antibody responses were preceded by bursts of spike-specific plasmablasts after both doses, but earlier and more intensely after dose two. Distinct antigen-specific MBC populations also emerged post-vaccination with varying kinetics. We identified antigen non-specific pre-vaccination MBC and post-vaccination plasmablasts after dose one and their spike-specific counterparts early after dose two that correlated with subsequent antibody levels.

In this study, we further showed that 2H6 binds stronger to the NS1 of H5N1 than A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) because of an amino acid difference at residue 48. A crystal structure of 2H6 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) has also been solved and docked onto the NS1 structure to reveal the contacts between specific residues at the interface of antibody-antigen complex. In one of the models, the predicted molecular contacts between residues in NS1 and 2H6-Fab correlate well with biochemical results. Taken together, residues N48 and T49 in H5N1 NS1 act cooperatively to maintain a strong interaction with mAb 2H6 by forming hydrogen bonds with residues found in the heavy chain of the antibody. Interestingly, the pandemic H1N1-2009 and the majority of seasonal H3N2 circulating in humans since 1968 has N48 in NS1, suggesting that mAb 2H6 could bind to most of the currently circulating seasonal influenza A virus strains. Consistent with the involvement of residue T49, which is well-conserved, in RNA binding, mAb 2H6 was also found to inhibit the interaction between NS1 and double-stranded RNA.","output":"Biochemical and structural characterization of the interface mediating interaction between the influenza A virus non-structural protein-1 and a monoclonal antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Our study aimed to describe themes of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines, race, and ethnicity to explore the context of the intersection of these topics on Twitter Methods: We utilized Twitters Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect a random 1% sample of publicly available tweets from October 2020 to January 2021 The study team conducted a qualitative content analysis from the full data set of 1110 tweets Results: The tweets revealed vaccine support through vaccine affirmation, advocacy through reproach, a need for a vaccine, COVID-19 and racism, vaccine development and efficacy, racist vaccine humor, and news updates Vaccine opposition was demonstrated through direct opposition, vaccine hesitancy, and adverse reactions Conspiracy and misinformation included scientific misinformation, political misinformation, beliefs about immunity and protective behaviors, and race extermination conspiracy Equity and access focused on overcoming history of medical racism, pointing out health disparities, and facilitators to vaccine access Representation touted pride in development and role models, and politics discussed the role of politics in vaccines and international politics Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that Twitter can provide nuances about multiple viewpoints on the vaccine related to race and ethnicity and can be beneficial in contributing to insights for public health messaging","output":"Advocacy, Hesitancy, and Equity: Exploring U.S. Race-Related Discussions of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are challenges related to collaboration among health professionals in resource-limited settings.

Although excess weight-related mortality has been studied in general, less is known about how it varies by demographic subgroup within the USA. In this study we estimated excess mortality associated with elevated body weight nationally and by state and subgroup. METHODS: We developed a nationally-representative microsimulation (individual-level) model of US adults between 1999 and 2016, based on risk factor data from 6,002,012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System respondents. Prior probability distributions for hazard ratios relating body-mass index (BMI) to mortality were informed by a global pooling dataset. Individual-level mortality risks were modelled accounting for demographics, smoking history, and BMI adjusted for self-report bias. We calibrated the model to empirical all-cause mortality rates from CDC WONDER by state and subgroup, and assessed the predictive accuracy of the model using a random sample of data withheld from model fitting. We simulated counterfactual scenarios to estimate excess mortality attributable to different levels of excess weight and smoking history. FINDINGS: We estimated that excess weight was responsible for more than 1300 excess deaths per day (nearly 500,000 per year) and a loss in life expectancy of nearly 24 years in 2016, contributing to higher excess mortality than smoking. Relative excess mortality rates were nearly twice as high for women compared to men in 2016 (219% vs 139%), and were higher for Black non-Hispanic adults. By state, overall excess weight-related life expectancy loss ranged from 175 years (95% UI 157C194) in Colorado to 318 years (95% UI 286-351) in Mississippi. INTERPRETATION: Excess weight has substantial impacts on mortality in the USA, with large disparities by state and subgroup. Premature mortality will likely increase as obesity continues to rise.

Prior to the implementation of hot spot analysis, the spatial autocorrelation results of CIR were obtained. Hot spot analysis and Anselin Local Moran's I indices were then applied to accurately locate high and low-risk clusters of COVID-19 globally. San Marino and Italy revealed the highest CMR by the end of March, though Belgium took the place of Italy as of 30th April. At the end of the research period (by 30th April), the CIR showed obvious spatial clustering. Accordingly, southern, northern and western Europe were detected in the high-high clusters demonstrating an increased risk of COVID-19 in these regions and also the surrounding areas. Countries of northern Africa exhibited a clustering of hot spots, with a confidence level above 95%, even though these areas assigned low CIR values. The hot spots accounted for nearly 70% of CIR. Furthermore, analysis of clusters and outliers demonstrated that these countries are situated in the low-high outlier pattern. Most of the surveyed countries that exhibited clustering of high values (hot spot) with a confidence level of 99% (by 31st March) and 95% (by 30th April) were dedicated higher CIR values.

First, we will cover work on 'classical' live attenuated virus vaccines as well as replication competent viral vector vaccines. Subsequently, we address replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Freeze drying and storage at 2-8 C with a shelf life of years has become the norm.

Methods Public Health England initiated SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in 18 secondary schools across six regions in September 2020. Participants provided nasal swabs for RT-PCR and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the beginning (September 2020) and end (December 2020) of the autumn term and at the start of the spring term (March 2021). Findings In March 2021, 1895 participants (1100 students, 795 staff) were tested; 5.6% (61/1094) students and 4.4% (35/792) staff had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 2020 and March 2021. Nucleoprotein antibody seroprevalence was 36.3% (370/1018) in students and 31.9% (245/769) in staff, while spike protein antibody prevalence was 39.5% (402/1018) and 59.8% (459/769), respectively, similar to regional community seroprevalence.

However, it remains under-explored and is not taken into account in health policies in Benin. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of PTSD after a road traffic accident. This will help to improve its diagnosis and management in Benin hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2020 to January 2021. Consenting victims of road traffic accidents from three hospitals across Benin, aged 18 years and above, living in the south of the country, were administered various questionnaires at 12-month follow-up. Data on PTSD were collected using a pre-tested, structured and standardized post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire, the PTSD Checklist (specific version) (PCL-S). A logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with PTSD. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) followed by a 95% confidence interval was calculated to determine the level of significance with a p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 865 patients in the cohort eligible for the 12-month follow-up, 734 (85%) participated in the study. The prevalence of PTSD was 26.43% (95% CI: 23.36C29.75). Factors associated with PTSD on multivariate analysis were female gender (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.38C3.33), hospitalization (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.21C2.89), negative impact of the accident on income (AOR = 4.22, 95% CI: 2.16C8.25), and no return to work (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.99C5.06). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PTSD is high in road accident survivors in Benin.

METHODS Data were obtained from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1988 to 1994 (N = 7817) and 1999-2002 (N = 2344). We fit Cox proportional hazard models to examine the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen with cancer mortality. RESULTS In the full Cox multivariate model, clinically raised CRP was associated with cancer mortality in NHANES 1988-1994 (> 0.99 mg/dL: 95%CI: 1.04-2.13). However, across two inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and Fibrinogen), two NHANES time periods (1998-1994 and 1999-2002) and three income levels (12 strata in total), Hazard ratio confidence intervals did not include the null only for one association: CRP and cancer mortality among low income participants from 1988 to 1994 (HR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.10-3.04).

Here, we study the problem of Lvy noise-driven escape from an almost rectangular, arctangent potential well restricted by two absorbing boundaries, mostly under the action of the Cauchy noise. We unveil analogies of the observed transient dynamics to the general properties of stationary states of Lvy processes in single-well potentials.

Yet, nitrate toxicity can be modulated by other stressors in the environment, such as elevated temperatures. Acclimation to elevated temperatures has been shown to offset the negative effects of nitrate on whole animal performance in fish, but the mechanisms underlying this cross-tolerance interaction remain unclear. In this study, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to a factorial combination of temperature (28 C or 32 C) and nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg NO3- L-1) treatments to test the hypothesis that thermal acclimation offsets the effects of nitrate via compensatory changes to the cardiorespiratory system (gills, ventricle and blood oxygen carrying capacity). Following 21 weeks of thermal acclimation, we found that fish acclimated to 32 C experienced an expansion of gill surface area and an increase in ventricular thickness regardless of nitrate exposure concentration. Exposure to nitrate (both 50 and 100 mg NO3- L-1) reduced the blood oxygen carrying capacity of silver perch due to increases in methaemoglobin concentration and a right shift in oxygen-haemoglobin binding curves in fish from both thermal acclimation treatments. These results indicate that plasticity of the gills and ventricle of warm acclimated fish are potential mechanisms which may provide cross-tolerance protection to elevated nitrate concentrations despite nitrate induced reductions to oxygen transport.","output":"Thermal plasticity of the cardiorespiratory system provides cross-tolerance protection to fish exposed to elevated nitrate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study intends to help in the battle against the transmission of COVID-19, a new human coronavirus, in any closed region of the study room, institution classroom, or laboratory.

Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen, immune cell markers (CD8, CD68 and CD56) and the complement C5b-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the viral particles in kidneys were also investigated by transmission electronic microscope (EM). RESULTS 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). The eldery patients and cases with comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001, respectively). H&E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. EM observation also demonstrated that viruses- like particles are visible in the kidneys. Viral infection not only induces CD68+ macrophages infiltrated into tubulointerstitium, but also enhances complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients. Viruses directly infect human kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage.

Understanding opioid consumption is improved by using an equianalgesic measure that controls for the strengths of all examined opioids. OBJECTIVES The research objective was to use a morphine equivalence (ME) metric to determine the extent that morphine consumption relates to the total consumption of all other study opioids. METHODS An ME metric was created for morphine and the aggregate consumption of each study opioid (Total ME), adjusted for country population to allow for uniform equianalgesic comparisons. Graphical and statistical evaluations of morphine use and Total ME consumption trends (between 1980 and 2009) were made for the global and geographic regional levels and selected developed and developing countries. RESULTS Global morphine consumption rose dramatically in the early 1980s but has been significantly outpaced by Total ME since 1996. As expected, the extent of morphine and Total ME consumption varied notably among regions, with the Americas, Europe, and Oceania regions accounting for the highest morphine use and Total ME in 2009. Developing and least developed countries, compared with developed countries, demonstrated lower overall Total ME consumption. CONCLUSION Generally, worldwide morphine use has not increased at the rate of Total ME, especially in recent years.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This ecological cohort study used longitudinal data on county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021, in 3220 counties from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: County-level daily COVID-19 case and death data from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021, were extracted from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. EXPOSURE: The Gini coefficient, a measure of unequal income distribution (presented as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a perfectly equal geographical region where all income is equally shared and 1 represents a perfectly unequal society where all income is earned by 1 individual), and other county-level data were obtained primarily from the 2014 to 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Covariates included median proportions of poverty, age, race/ethnicity, crowding given by occupancy per room, urbanicity and rurality, educational level, number of physicians per 100 000 individuals, state, and mask use at the county level. RESULTS: As of February 28, 2021, on average, each county recorded a median of 8891 cases of COVID-19 per 100 000 individuals (interquartile range, 6935-10 666 cases per 100 000 individuals) and 156 deaths per 100 000 individuals (interquartile range, 94-228 deaths per 100 000 individuals). The median county-level Gini coefficient was 0.44 (interquartile range, 0.42-0.47). There was a positive correlation between Gini coefficients and county-level COVID-19 cases (Spearman  = 0.052; P < .001) and deaths (Spearman  = 0.134; P < .001) during the study period. This association varied over time; each 0.05-unit increase in Gini coefficient was associated with an adjusted relative risk of COVID-19 deaths: 1.25 (95% CI, 1.17-1.33) in March and April 2020, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.13-1.28) in May and June 2020, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.37-1.55) in July and August 2020, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98-1.10) in September and October 2020, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81) in November and December 2020, and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96-1.07) in January and February 2021 (P < .001 for interaction).

Thus, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end (E2E) study showed that the effective combination for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces includes using an Isohelix swab collection tool, DNA/RNA Shield as a preservative, an automated system for RNA extraction, and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as the detection assay. Using this E2E approach, this study showed that, in some cases, noninfectious viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2 persisted on surfaces for as long as 8 days even after bleach treatment. Additionally, debris associated with specific built environment surfaces appeared to inhibit and negatively impact the recovery of RNA; Amerstat demonstrated the highest inhibition (>90%) when challenged with an inactivated viral control. Overall, it was determined that this E2E protocol required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm(2) to successfully detect virus from test surfaces.

Among 216 ischemic stroke patients, moderate-to-severe stroke was more represented in cohort-2020 (17.8% vs 6.2%, p = .027). Similar proportions of patients underwent reperfusion (45.9% in 2019 vs 53.4% in 2020), although a slight increase in combined treatment was detected (14.4% vs 25.4%, p = .05). Door-to-scan timing was significantly prolonged in 2020 compared with 2019 (28.4  12.6 vs 36.7  14.6, p = .03), although overall timing from stroke to treatment was preserved. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, TIA and minor stroke consistently reduced compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Longer stroke-to-call and door-to-scan times, attributable to change in citizen behavior and screening at hospital arrival, did not impact on stroke-to-treatment time.

DESIGN: Single site, prospective, single-arm study. METHODS: Subjects presenting for cataract surgery who had an interest in reducing their dependence on glasses at multiple distances were enrolled. Subjects were bilaterally implanted with a trifocal IOL and followed for 3 months post-surgery. A spectacle independence questionnaire and a quality of vision questionnaire were administered at the 3-month visit. The binocular visual acuity at distance (4 m), intermediate (60 cm) and near (40 cm) was also measured in the uncorrected and distance-corrected state. RESULTS: All but one subject reported no need for glasses for distance and intermediate work, and most (25/29) reported no need for glasses for near work. Almost all subjects reported never wearing glasses or wearing them only a little, and being able to function without glasses at any distance all or most of the time. Ninety percent of subjects (26/29) reported being completely or mostly satisfied with their vision overall, without the use of glasses or contact lenses. The mean binocular visual acuity 1 and 3 months after surgery was better than 0.1 logMAR (20/25) at all test distances in both the uncorrected and distance-corrected states. The reported quality of vision appeared similar to previously reported data for the same IOL. CONCLUSION: The trifocal IOL provided nearly all subjects with functional vision and spectacle independence for distance, intermediate and near work.

Due to the heterogeneity of virus spread, there are spatial variations in the demand for medical resources such as personal protective equipment (PPE), testing kits, and vaccines. The availability of such medical resources is critical to effective epidemic control. Although these resources can be readily transported to designated areas for fighting an epidemic, the demand is increasing and varying in space that places significant stress on the supply and allocation of medical resources. However, little has been done on the tessellation of infection distributions for resource management. In this letter, we develop new tessellation algorithms for decision support in epidemic resource allocation and management. The objective is to estimate resource locations and coverage based on the spatial analysis of heterogeneous infection distribution. First, spatial tessellation centroids are initialized through either greedy or cluster-centric approaches. Next, the locations of tessellation centroids are calibrated through a gradient learning algorithm. Lastly, the spread tessellation is computed to provide an estimation of resource coverages under the heterogeneous infection distribution. The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated using a COVID-19 case study of infection data in Pennsylvania. Experimental results show the proposed methodology effectively tessellates the spread of infectious diseases. The new spread tessellation algorithms are shown to have strong potentials for epidemic decision support in infection modelling and resource allocation.","output":"Spatial Tessellation of Infectious Disease Spread for Epidemic Decision Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause severe vascular complications associated with endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation. COVID19-specific IgG are detectable within a week of infection. Long COVID-19 has been described in patients continuing to exhibit symptoms after the virus is no longer detectable in the respiratory secretions, including fatigue, dyspnea, headache, and brain fog. The recent FAIR Health study reviewed a total of 1,959,982 COVID-19 patients for the prevalence of long COVID symptoms and reported that 23.2% had at least one post-COVID symptom [1]. The underlying biologic mechanisms of long COVID remain unclear, thus treatments are limited to symptomatic relief and supportive care. Many long COVID symptoms are consistent with systemic inflammation and impaired oxygen delivery observed in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), in turn associated with elevated blood cell adhesion and decreased red blood cell (RBC) stability. The aim of this study was to determine if deleterious changes in in blood cell properties related to adhesion and membrane stability under stress can be associated with the symptoms of long COVID-19. In this work we evaluated 7 SCD patients that were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 and tracked their recovery using semiquantitative IgG and blood cell function assays. Methods: Blood samples were collected by the Foundation for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Research from SCD (homozygous SS, n=6) patients coming for regular or urgent clinic visit with SARS-CoV-2 serological and blood cell functions tests performed per the standard of care. Semiquantitative IgG assay was performed using DXi-80 (Beckman Coulter). Flow adhesion of whole blood to VCAM-1 (FA-WB-VCAM)and P-Selectin (FA-WB-Psel) substrates were determined by counting the cells that remain adherent in a microfluidics channel after perfusion with whole blood 1:1 diluted with HBSS buffer and washed by reversed flow at 1 dyne/cm 2. Red blood cell mechanical fragility (RBC MF) was measured as hemolysis induced by an oscillating cylindrical magnet with periodic non-invasive probing of cell-free hemoglobin fraction. Six individuals with SCD recovering from SARS-Cov-2 with biomarker data available both before and for more than 3 months after the infection (17962 days) were included in the study. Results: IgG levels varied from less than 0.1 to 37, with positive values being defined as IgG > 1. The median estimated half-life of IgG decline was 53 days ranging from 25 to 90 days (the last, for the hospitalized patient). Averaged for IgG positive (IgG+) and IgG negative (IgG-) conditions, combining pre- and post-infection IgG- conditions, values of patient hemoglobin (Hb), FA-WB-VCAM, FA-WB-Psel, and RBC MF cell properties lacked statistical significance (under both a paired t-test and population statistics). Hb levels remained essentially unchanged regardless of the time from infection or IgG status. However, FA-WB-VCAM, FA-WB-Psel, and RBC MF were all significantly elevated after SARS-Cov-2 seroconversion and remained elevated despite declining IgG levels (e.g., Fig. 1). These increases in biomarker values were statistically significant for both FA-WB-VCAM and RBC MF, and were approaching significance for FA-WB-Psel (p<0065). These increases were highly patient-specific with potential return to pe-infection values observed in some cases at about 5-6 months after the infection. A qualitative review of the medical records indicated a new subjective report of fatigue in 5 of 6 patients. Longer observations are required to determine if abnormal blood cell adhesive properties and RBC membrane instability are mechanisms of long-COVID-19 pathophysiology. Conclusions: Whole blood adhesion to both p-selectin and VCAM-1 as well as RBC membrane stability can be significantly impaired in convalescent SARS-Cov-2 patients suggesting an association with long COVID-19. New and emerging treatments that modify whole blood adhesive properties and RBC membrane stability should be investigated for their potential to accelerated recovery from long COVID-19. Health F.

By using a panel of rabbit antisera against virions and five structural proteins together with a convalescent serum, the spike (S) glycoprotein was shown to be N-linked glycosylated, PNGase F-sensitive, endoglycosidase H-resistant and cleaved by Furin-like proteases into S1 and S2 subunits. The full-length S and S1/S2 subunits could form homodimers/trimers. The membrane (M) protein was partially N-linked glycosylated; the accessory protein 3a existed in three different forms, indicative of cleavage and dimerization. Furthermore, analysis of the antigenicity of these proteins and their post-translationally modified forms demonstrated that S protein induced the strongest antibody response in both convalescent and immunized animal sera. Interestingly, immunization with the inactivated vaccine did not elicit antibody response against the S2 subunit, whereas strong antibody response against both S1 and S2 subunits was detected in the convalescent serum. Moreover, vaccination stimulated stronger antibody response against S multimers than did the natural infection. This study revealed that the native S glycoprotein stimulated neutralizing antibodies, while bacterially-expressed S fragments did not.

Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has forced universities to modify their academic curriculum to adapt and overcome never before seen adversities. Herein we present the implementation of a Hybrid Virtual Clinical Model for Surgical Clerkships and its comparison against traditional face-to-face learning. Methods: : We surveyed 47 medical students prior to their first-ever clerkship using Maslachs Burnout Inventory and a questionnaire regarding their interest in surgery as a career path before and after their clerkship. Burnout rates, clinical exposure, academic performance, and surgical interest were analyzed and compared against results from prior year students on a traditional program. Results: : Baseline burnout was significantly lower in the hybrid model (15.4% vs. 2.6%, p=0.048). The same was seen on alternate burnout rates (33.3% vs. 10.3%, p=0.02), differences remained after three months of clerkship (23.1% vs. 5.1%, p=0.023). When comparing different domains such as professional fulfillment, depersonalization, and fatigue, the hybrid model did overall better. Clinical exposure hours were statistically significant between both groups (954.32 vs. 276.33, p=0.001), however, when considering virtual clinical hours, no significant differences were found. Despite the hybrid group having a lower midterm exam score (68 vs. 77.49, p=0.001), final exam scores were similar between groups (74.97 vs. 75.89, p=0.662). Conclusion: We believe our model may be useful for other programs to maximize clinical exposure while minimizing the risk of exposure, maintaining maximum academic performance, and preserving the surgical interest of rotating alumni.

Objective: To evaluate rates of antispike (anti-S) antibody response to a BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with cancer who are undergoing systemic treatment vs healthy controls. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 102 adult patients with solid tumors undergoing active intravenous anticancer treatment and 78 controls who received the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 12 days before enrollment. The controls were taken from a convenience sample of the patients' family/caregivers who accompanied them to treatment. The study was conducted between February 22, 2021, and March 15, 2021 at Davidoff Cancer Center at Beilinson Hospital (Petah Tikva, Israel). Interventions: Blood samples were drawn from the study participants. Serum samples were analyzed and the titers of the IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain were determined using a commercially available immunoassay. Seropositivity was defined as 50 or greater AU/mL. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the rate of seropositivity. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of IgG titers and identifying factors that were associated with seropositivity using univariate/multivariable analyses. Results: The analysis included 180 participants, which comprised 102 patients with cancer (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 66 [56-72] years; 58 men [57%]) and 78 healthy controls (median [IQR] age, 62 [49-70] years; 25 men [32%]). The most common tumor type was gastrointestinal (29 [28%]). In the patient group, 92 (90%) were seropositive for SARS-CoV 2 antispike IgG antibodies after the second vaccine dose, whereas in the control group, all were seropositive. The median IgG titer in the patients with cancer was significantly lower than that in the controls (1931 [IQR, 509-4386] AU/mL vs 7160 [IQR, 3129-11a?241] AU/mL; P < .001). In a multivariable analysis, the only variable that was significantly associated with lower IgG titers was treatment with chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (?, -3.5; 95% CI, -5.6 to -1.5). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients with cancer who were receiving active systemic therapy, 90% of patients exhibited adequate antibody response to the BNT162b2 vaccine, although their antibody titers were significantly lower than those of healthy controls. Further research into the clinical relevance of lower titers and their durability is required.

Thus, there is a noticeable focus on DL approaches to automate software engineering (SE) tasks such as maintenance, requirement extraction, and classification. An advanced utilization of DL is the ensemble approach, which aims to reduce error rates and learning time and improve performance. In this research, three ensemble approaches were applied: accuracy as a weight ensemble, mean ensemble, and accuracy per class as a weight ensemble with a combination of four different DL modelslong short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and a convolutional neural network (CNN)in order to classify the software requirement (SR) specification, the binary classification of SRs into functional requirement (FRs) or non-functional requirements (NFRs), and the multi-label classification of both FRs and NFRs into further experimental classes. The models were trained and tested on the PROMISE dataset. A one-phase classification system was developed to classify SRs directly into one of the 17 multi-classes of FRs and NFRs. In addition, a two-phase classification system was developed to classify SRs first into FRs or NFRs and to pass the output to the second phase of multi-class classification to 17 classes. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed classification systems can lead to a competitive classification performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Healthcare professionals have been particularly vulnerable because of the unprecedented shortage of Facepiece Respirators (FPRs), which act as fundamental tools to protect the medical staff treating the coronavirus patients. In addition, many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use devices, creating an issue related to the generation of large quantities of non-biodegradable waste. In this contribution, we describe a plasma-based decontamination technique designed to circumvent the shortages of FPRs and alleviate the environmental problems posed by waste generation. The system utilizes a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) to generate ozone and feed it through the fibers of the FPRs. The flow-through configuration is different than canonical ozone-based sterilization methods, in which the equipment is placed in a sealed ozone-containing enclosure without any flow through the mask polymer fibers. We demonstrate the rapid decontamination of surgical masks using Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as model pathogens, with the flow-through configuration providing a drastic reduction in sterilization time compared to the canonical approach. We also demonstrate that there is no deterioration in mask structure or filtration efficiency resulting from sterilization. Finally, we show that this decontamination approach can be implemented using readily available tools, such as a plastic box, a glass tube, few 3D printed components, and the high-voltage power supply from a plasma globe toy.

Relief of dyspnoea and improvement in quality of life can be achieved with either talc pleurodesis or insertion of an indwelling tunneled pleural catheter (IPC). The former requires a lengthy hospital stay and the latter is associated with lower pleurodesis rates. In response to limited hospital bed capacity, we developed a pragmatic approach in managing MPE by combining thoracoscopic talc poudrage and insertion of IPC into a single day case procedure. We present data on the safety and efficacy of this approach. Methods: Patients who had undergone the abovementioned procedure between 2017 and 2020 were analyzed. Demographic data, hospital length of stay (LOS), histological diagnosis, rates of pleurodesis success and procedural related complications were collated. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. Results: Forty-five patients underwent the procedure. Mean age was 68.5  10.4 years and 56% were male.

This population is therefore particularly vulnerable to the negative health effects caused by household air pollution, including negative pregnancy outcomes and other health issues throughout life. The Midwife Project, a collaboration between research and health teams in the UK and Uganda, began in 2016 to implement an education program on lung health for mothers in Uganda, to reduce the health risks to women and children. Education materials were produced to guide midwives in the delivery of health messages across four rural health centres, and mixed-methods results of knowledge questionnaires and interviews demonstrated knowledge acquisition, acceptability and feasibility. This qualitative follow-up study aimed to improve understanding of the longer term impact of this education program from the perspective of midwives, village health team members and mothers, in consideration of rolling the program out more widely in rural Uganda. METHODS Purposive sampling was carried out to recruit consenting antenatal or postnatal women, midwives and village health team members who had been involved in an education session. Individual interviews were conducted with 12 mothers and four village health team members, and four focus groups were conducted with 10 midwives in total. Interviews and focus groups were conducted across all four health centres by two researchers and six translators as appropriate depending on language spoken (English or Lusoga). These were semi-structured and directed by topic guides. Reflective and observational notes were also made. A thematic analysis was carried out by two researchers, along with production of a narrative for each mother, to enrich understanding of each individual story. RESULTS Midwives and village health teams had continued with the program well past the project end date and all mothers expressed making, or intending to make, changes, suggesting long-term feasibility and acceptability. Main themes generated were ability to change and changes made, ability to change dictated by money, importance of practical education, perceived health improvements, and passing on knowledge. Additional findings were that some education topics seemed to be overlooked, and there was a lack of clarity about the village health team role for the purposes of this program. Some mothers had been motivated to overcome financial barriers, for example by reconstructing cooking areas cheaply themselves. However, information given in the program about building advice and potential financial gains was inconsistent. CONCLUSION Recommendations for future biomass smoke education should include explicit building advice, emphasis on financial gains, encouragement to share the knowledge acquired and clarification of the village health team role. These program changes will improve focus and relevancy, optimise impact and, with behaviour change and implementation strategy in mind, could be used for widespread rollout in rural Uganda.

The current study prospectively evaluated parenting behaviors during the pandemic (N=87). Results indicated that all negative affect emotions investigated were positively associated with controlling parenting behaviors. However, only COVID-related fear predicted changes in controlling parenting behaviors across timepoints.

Conventional vaccinology (isolate, inactivate and inject) approaches are time consuming, laborious and expensive; therefore, the use of computational vaccinology tools are imperative, which can facilitate the design of new and promising vaccine candidates. RESULTS: In current investigation, initially 5548 proteins of P. falciparum genome were carefully chosen for the incidence of signal peptide/ anchor using SignalP4.0 tool that resulted into 640 surface linked proteins (SLP). Out of these SLP, only 17 were predicted to contain GPI-anchors using PredGPI tool in which further 5 proteins were considered as malarial antigenic adhesins by MAAP and VaxiJen programs, respectively. In the subsequent step, T cell epitopes of 5 genome derived predicted antigenic adhesins (GDPAA) and 5 randomly selected known malarial adhesins (RSKMA) were analysed employing MHC class I and II tools of IEDB analysis resource. Finally, VaxiJen scored T cell epitopes from each antigen were considered for prediction of population coverage (PPC) analysis in the world-wide population including malaria endemic regions. The validation of the present in silico strategy was carried out by comparing the PPC of combined (MHC class I and II) predicted epitope ensemble among GDPAA (99.97%), RSKMA (99.90%) and experimentally known epitopes (EKE) of P. falciparum (97.72%) pertaining to world-wide human population. CONCLUSIONS: The present study systematically screened 5 potential protective antigens from P. falciparum genome using bioinformatics tools. Interestingly, these GDPAA, RSKMA and EKE of P. falciparum epitope ensembles forecasted to contain highly promiscuous T cell epitopes, which are potentially effective for most of the world-wide human population with malaria endemic regions. Therefore, these epitope ensembles could be considered in near future for novel and significantly effective vaccine candidate against malaria.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) on respiration and hemodynamics in post cardiac surgery patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A single-center randomized control trial was performed. In total, 138 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were prospectively screened. Ultimately 39 patients met the inclusion criteria and were randomized into two groups: 19 patients were managed with pressure control ventilation (PCV) and 20 patients were managed with APRV. Respiratory mechanics after 4 h, hemodynamics within the first day, and Chest radiograph score (CRS) and blood gasses within the first three days were recorded and compared. RESULTS: A higher cardiac index (3.1  0.7 vs. 2.8  0.8 L?min(C1)?m(2); p < 0.05), and shock volume index (35.4  9.2 vs. 33.1  9.7 ml m(C2); p < 0.05) were also observed in the APRV group after 4 h as well as within the first day (p < 0.05).

One of the CTH intervention components is a series of communications campaigns to promote the implementation of EBPs, increase demand for naloxone and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and decrease stigma toward people with opioid use disorder and the use of EBPs, especially MOUD. This paper describes the approach to developing and executing these campaigns. METHODS: The HCS communication campaigns are developed and implemented through a collaboration between communication experts, research site staff, and community coalitions using a three-stage process. The Prepare phase identifies priority groups to receive campaign messages, develops content for those messages, and identifies a call to action that asks people to engage in a specific behavior. In the Plan phase, campaign resources are produced, and community coalitions develop plans to distribute campaign materials. During the Implement stage, these distribution plans guide delivery of content to priority groups. Fidelity measures assess how community coalitions follow their distribution plan as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation. An evaluation of the communication campaigns is planned. CONCLUSIONS: If successful, the Prepare-Plan-Implement process, and the campaign materials, could be adapted and used by other communities to address the opioid crisis. The campaign evaluation will extend the evidence base for how communication campaigns can be developed and implemented through a community-engaged process to effectively address public health crises.","output":"Health Communication Campaigns to Drive Demand for Evidence-based Practices and Reduce Stigma in the HEALing Communities Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recovery of the public transportation system is critical for both social re-engagement and economic rebooting after the shutdown during pandemic like COVID-19.

However, the practical uses are limited due to high costs and the risk of anti-drug antibody responses. Attempts to develop anti-TNF- vaccines have generated encouraging data in animal models, however, data from clinical trials have not met expectations. In present study, we designed a TNF- epitope-scaffold immunogen DTNF7 using the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin, named DTT as a scaffold. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the grafted TNF- epitope is entirely surface-exposed and presented in a native-like conformation while the rigid helical structure of DTT is minimally perturbed, thereby rendering the immunogen highly stable. Immunization of mice with alum formulated DTNF7 induced humoral responses against native TNF-, and the antibody titer was sustained for more than 6 months, which supports a role of the universal CD4 T cell epitopes of DTT in breaking self-immune tolerance. In a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, DTNF7-alum vaccination markedly delayed the onset of collagen-induced arthritis, and reduced incidence as well as clinical score. DTT is presumed safe as an epitope carrier because a catalytic inactive mutant of diphtheria toxin, CRM197 has good clinical safety records as an active vaccine component.

Herein, the radiolytic degradation of antibiotic Cephalosporin C (CEP-C) in different water matrices was comprehensively investigated using gamma radiation at various experimental conditions. The results revealed that CEP-C oxidation obeyed pseudo first-order kinetics, and 100%, 94.9%, 67.0%, 44.6% and 34.5% removal of CEP-C with 10-200 mg/L was achieved at 0.4 kGy, respectively. The degradation was faster at higher absorbed dose and acidic conditions (pH = 3.5). The inorganic anions, including SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-, had negative influence on the degradation of CEP-C, the corresponding rate constant decreased from 4.603 to 3.667, 1.677 and 2.509 kGy-1 respectively in the presence of SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-. The analysis of intermediate products indicated that CEP-C was oxidized to generate about 10 intermediate products. Besides, it was inferred that the thioether sulfur oxidation, -lactam ring opening, acetyl dissociation from dihydrothiazine ring and D--aminohexylamide group abscission were the major reaction mechanisms of CEP-C degradation by gamma radiation. Importantly, the antibacterial activity of CEP-C could be completely vanished by gamma radiation alone, while more toxic intermediate products might be formed. Addition of hydrogen peroxide and peroxymonosulfate could significantly improve the CEP-C degradation, and reduce the toxicity of intermediates of CEP-C degradation.

A screening tool is valuable as the healthcare community balances protection of medical personnel and conservation of PPE. There is little existing literature on the efficacy of prehospital COVID-19 screening tools. The objective of this study was to determine the positive and negative predictive value of an emergency infectious disease surveillance tool for detecting COVID-19 patients and the impact of positive screening on PPE usage. Methods: This study was a retrospective chart review of prehospital care reports and hospital electronic health records. We ed records for all 911 calls to an urban EMS from March 1CJuly 31, 2020 that had a documented positive screen for COVID-19 and/or had a positive COVID-19 test. The dispatch screen solicited information regarding travel, sick contacts, and high-risk symptoms. We reviewed charts to determine dispatch-screening results, the outcome of patients COVID-19 testing, and documentation of crew fidelity to PPE guidelines. Results: The sample size was 263. The rate of positive COVID-19 tests for all-comers in the state of Massachusetts was 2.0%. The dispatch screen had a sensitivity of 74.9% (confidence interval [CI], 69.21-80.03) and a specificity of 67.7% (CI, 66.91-68.50). The positive predictive value was 4.5% (CI, 4.17-4.80), and the negative predictive value was 99.3% (CI, 99.09-99.40). The most common symptom that triggered a positive screen was shortness of breath (51.5% of calls). The most common high-risk population identified was skilled nursing facility patients (19.5%), but most positive tests did not belong to a high-risk population (58.1%). The EMS personnel were documented as wearing full PPE for the patient in 55.7% of encounters, not wearing PPE in 8.0% of encounters, and not documented in 27.9% of encounters. Conclusion: This dispatch-screening questionnaire has a high negative predictive value but moderate sensitivity and therefore should be used with some caution to guide EMS crews in their PPE usage.

While physical activity (PA) is proposed as a cost-effective method to alleviate problems after moderate to severe TBI, there is no review to date that synthesizes the evidence for PA in the community-based context. Further, although sex- and gender-based considerations in research are considered requisite to good science, there is no review on PA and TBI that has included this explicit focus. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to map and synthesize the current evidence identified through a systematic search of community-based PA interventions for individuals of all ages with moderate to severe TBI and provide an overview of that evidence by asking the following research questions: (1) what are the characteristics of community-based PA programs for individuals with moderate to severe TBI, (2) what are the reported health-related outcomes and measurement tools used to evaluate them, and (3) what considerations have been given to sex and/or gender? METHODS: Searches will be conducted of six academic databases for peer-reviewed articles. Two reviewers will independently screen the articles for inclusion and extract data for the analysis. The extracted data will be coded according to the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template checklist and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist to provide sufficient detail for replication. RESULTS: The abstract screening was completed by two reviewers and the extracted data were analyzed. A qualitative synthesis and description of community-based PA interventions for individuals with moderate to severe TBI will be provided. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review will generate new knowledge from published and publicly available literature. Dissemination of the results will include activities related to knowledge transfer for community-based PA after moderate to severe TBI for future research and practice.

Treatment of mouse L-2 fibroblasts with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV to a much lesser degree than that of VSV, suggesting a relatively minor role for the endocytic pathway and functional endosomes in MHV infection. Endocytosis of MHV and VSV into L-2 cells was assayed by the recovery of infectious (i.e., not uncoated) viruses from homogenates of cells harvested within the first few minutes of infection (and treated with protease to remove surface-bound virus). The results thus suggest that while a small proportion of the MHV inoculum is internalized by endocytosis, productive infection does not depend on functional endocytosis as utilized by VSV. Studies on direct virion-mediated cell fusion showed that MHV can induce fusion at pH 7.4, whereas VSV causes fusion at pH 5.0. Taken together, the above results suggest that MHV enters L-2 cells predominantly by membrane fusion with a non-acidified compartment such as the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, or endosomes (prior to their acidification). Results obtained from cell lines which differed in permissiveness to MHV infection suggested that the ability to support MHV infection does not correlate with endocytosis. Rather, nonpermissive cells, such as rat astrocytoma (C-6) and Vero cells, showed higher levels of recoverable internalized MHV than did fully permissive L-2 cells. Cells which are normally nonpermissive to MHV, could be rendered MHV-susceptible by PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus. Such PEG-mediated susceptibility to MHV infection was insensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride, supporting the idea that host cell restriction of MHV infection in C-6 and Vero cells may be due to a block in nonendosomal membrane fusion. Thus endocytic internalization of MHV, which clearly occurs in a variety of cells, does not guarantee productive infection.","output":"Differentiation of acid-ph-dependent and -nondependent entry pathways for mouse hepatitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report summarizes the outcome of a workshop held in Mysuru, India in January 2020 addressing the adverse health effects of exposure to biomass smoke (BMS) The aim of the workshop was to identify uncertainties and gaps in knowledge and possible methods to address them in the Mysuru study on Determinants of Health in Rural Adults (MUDHRA) cohort Specific aims were to discuss the possibility to improve and introduce new screening methods for exposure and effect, logistic limitations and other potential obstacles, and plausible strategies to overcome these in future studies Field visits were included in the workshop prior to discussing these issues The workshop concluded that multi-disciplinary approaches to perform: (a) indoor and personalized exposure assessment;(b) clinical and epidemiological field studies among children, adolescents, and adults;(c) controlled exposure experiments using physiologically relevant in vitro and in vivo models to understand molecular patho-mechanisms are warranted to dissect BMS-induced adverse health effects It was perceived that assessment of dietary exposure (like phytochemical index) may serve as an important indicator for understanding potential protective mechanisms Well trained field teams and close collaboration with the participating hospital were identified as the key requirements to successfully carry out the study objectives","output":"Clinical, Epidemiological and Experimental Approaches to Assess Adverse Health Outcomes of Indoor Biomass Smoke Exposure: Conclusions from An Indo-Swedish Workshop in Mysuru, January 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on data updated to May 20, 2020, in Italy the total recorded number of patients who died due to COVID-19-related reasons is 31,851.

Health authority recommends flu vaccination in a number of categories at risk of serious medical complications: subjects over 65, patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, COPD, renal failure, cancer, immunodeficiencies, chronic hepatopathies and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The peak of the seasonal flu certainly preceded the pandemic one; however, it would seem clear that for a while the two viruses have been circulating simultaneously in Italy. Hence, after its peak, Influenza-like Illness-related (ILI) deaths started to grow again. While some of the excess mortality reported in the ILI group may be attributable to COVID-19, a question arises: do we have to consider this observation as a result of a random sequence of events or a potential relationship between the two viruses play a role?

It would be of great relevance to identify patients at a very high risk of mortality as a result of an overlapping or combination of risk factors reported separately in patients died from COVID-19 or influenza. The description of the subgroup of patients at higher risk of mortality will be crucial for the prioritization and implementation of future public health prevention and treatment programmes.","output":"Simultaneous circulation of COVID-19 and flu in Italy: potential combined effects on the risk of death?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Curitiba, Brazil. METHODS: Upper respiratory samples from 1077 HCWs were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from June 16, 2020 to December 9, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 32.7% of HCWs were infected. The positivity rates in symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs were 39.2% and 15.9%, respectively. Hospital departments categorized as high-risk for exposure had the highest number of infected HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and isolation of infected HCWs remain key in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission because HCWs in close contact with COVID-19 patients are more likely to be infected than those who are not.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection among healthcare workers in a tertiary public hospital in Curitiba, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Diabetes is related to risk for heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and COVID-19. It is exacerbated by built/social environment issues, e.g., food insecurity, access to healthy foods and health care, and other poverty-related factors. Our goal is to assess the efficacy of an integrated care model for patients with poorly controlled diabetes. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We utilize an integrated, team-based approach to diabetes treatment. In a traditional care model, too little focus is on social determinants and their impacts on health and well-being. Our project involves enrollment of patients with diabetes in an intervention whereby their medical care is integrated with intensive diabetes education and provision of social and other health services, including diet and nutrition, exercise, provision of foods and nutritional supplements, and other support services as needed to achieve optimal health and to reduce morbidity and unnecessary hospitalization and emergency room visits. Subjects are underserved patients treated through our non-profit community clinic partners. We track metrics including individual outcomes, organizational outcomes, and collective impact. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We anticipate that patients enrolled in this study will demonstrate significant improvements in diabetes control and management. Clinical improvements will include better glycemic control, improved hypertension and dyslipidemia management, reduced complications, and increased preventive measures including foot, eye and oral health exams and monitoring of microalbuminuria. Overall, we anticipate decreased frequency of hospitalizations and readmissions as well as decreased frequency of emergency care visits for treatment of diabetes-related issues. We expect patients to experience enhanced self-efficacy, increased physical activity, and improved quality of life. Their outcomes will be compared to controls receiving the standard medical regimen, matched on age, race, gender, and time of onset. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These activities will improve understanding of factors influencing diabetes outcomes at individual and upstream levels. It will inform food distribution and models of care for improved patient outcomes, including social determinants of health and will establish new protocols for community-based provision of health care to our most vulnerable.","output":"A Team-based Approach to an Integrated Model of Diabetes Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to online teaching from home, I am using that time for my research work.

As a result, RP patients usually suffer from reduced night vision, loss of peripheral vision, decreased visual acuity, and impaired color perception. Although photoreceptor cell death is the primary outcome of RP, the underlying mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Ferroptosis is a novel programmed cell death, with characteristic iron overload and lipid peroxidation. Recent studies, using in vitro and in vivo RP models, discovered the involvement of ferroptosis-associated cell death, suggesting a possible new mechanism for RP pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the association between ferroptosis and photoreceptor cell damage, and its implication in the pathogenesis of RP. We propose that ferroptotic cell death not only opens up a new research area in RP, but may also serve as a novel therapeutic target for RP.","output":"Cell Ferroptosis: New Mechanism and New Hope for Retinitis Pigmentosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many complex problems require a multi-criteria decision, such as the COVID-19 pandemic that affected nearly all activities in the world. In this regard, this study aims to develop a multi-criteria decision support system considering the sustainability, feasibility, and success rate of possible approaches. Therefore, two models have been developed: Geo-AHP (applying geo-based data) and BN-Geo-AHP using probabilistic techniques (Bayesian network). The ranking method of Geo-APH is generalized, and the equations are provided in a way that adding new elements and variables would be possible by experts. Then, to improve the ranking, the application of the probabilistic technique of a Bayesian network and the role of machine learning for database and weight of each parameter are explained, and the model of BN-Geo-APH has been developed. In the next step, to show the application of the developed Geo-AHP and BN-Geo-AHP models, we selected the new pandemic of COVID-19 that affected nearly all activities, and we used both models for analysis. For this purpose, we first analyzed the available data about COVID-19 and previous studies about similar virus infections, and then we ranked the main approaches and alternatives in confronting the pandemic of COVID-19. The analysis of approaches with the selected alternatives shows the first ranked approach is massive vaccination and the second ranked is massive swabs or other tests. The third is the use of medical masks and gloves, and the last ranked is the lockdown, mostly due to its major negative impact on the economy and individuals.

We investigated the impact of a variety of stressful life events on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility. Methods: We analyzed data from a large prospective cohort study of men (n = 1,437) in the Boston area (assessed in 1985, 1988, and 1991). Main outcomes were measures of depression, anxiety and hostility symptoms. We used the Elders Life Stress Inventory (ELSI) to measure stressful life events in the past 12 months and examine their association with symptoms of depression, anxiety and hostility. First, we analyzed the association of stressful life events with symptom changes; second, we categorized stressful life events into finance/work, health, relationships, loss, living situations events; and third, we estimated the specific association between relationship events and depression, anxiety and hostility symptoms using multilevel models. Results: The most frequent stressful life events were health, relationship, and financial events. Depression, anxiety, and hostility symptoms were relatively stable among men who did not experience these life events. However, those who reported life events in the past 12 months had a greater increase in symptoms of depression (+0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) and of hostility (+0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.09) than those who did not. Additionally, we found a significant decrease in hostility (?0.05; 95% CI: ?0.08 to ?0.01) in those experiencing no life events. Conclusion: Relationship events were more important than any other type of events, and were significantly associated with increased depression and hostility in aging men.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ANGII in patients with shock on MCS. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A single-center, quaternary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised critically ill patients on MCS. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included in this retrospective analysis. The median age was 54 years (44.8, 68.3) and 78.6% were men. Six patients were receiving venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, 4 patients were receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and 4 patients were on left ventricular assist devices. Five patients (36%) achieved hemodynamic response to ANGII at 3 hours, defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg or a 10-mmHg increase in MAP with a decrease or no change in total vasopressor dose. Overall, the median MAP increased from 61 mmHg (51, 73) at baseline to 66 mmHg (58, 71) at 3 hours, and the median norepinephrine dose decreased from 0.45 g/kg/min (0.28, 0.6) at baseline to 0.2 g/kg/min (0.18, 0.32) at 3 hours. The in-hospital mortality rate was 78.6%. Two patients experienced severe adverse drug events and 1 patient had a sentinel thrombotic event. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that ANGII may provide a salvage treatment option in patients on MCS with refractory vasodilatory shock. There are several safety considerations with the use of ANGII in these patients.

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis, a severe fungal infection, is an emerging public health concern during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The global burden of CKD is increasing, and is projected to become the 5th most common cause of years of life lost globally by 2040. CKD is a major cause of catastrophic health expenditure. The costs of dialysis and transplantation consume 2-3% of the annual healthcare budget in high-income countries. Crucially, kidney disease can be prevented and progression to end-stage kidney disease can be delayed with appropriate access to basic diagnostics and early treatment. This year World Kidney Day continues to raise awareness of the increasing burden of kidney diseases worldwide and to strive for kidney health for everyone, everywhere. During the pandemic with COVID 19 patients kidneys are also damaged, apart from the respiratory tract and other organs. It can lead to an increase in acute renal failure and consequent chronic kidney insufficiency, as well as number of deaths.

Despite the general use of this concept, to date, there is no clear and objective description to accurately explain what it is. In this work, we have decoded and gave clarity to the concept of hair transparency via a technical model (validated for both Japan and China markets) composed of measurable parameters of hair property using a single device. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS A comprehensive study composed of various tests was used, starting with a qualitative identification of key parameters via in-depth workshop discussions with over 40 Japanese stylists and a panel of 12 consumers. These identified parameters (luminosity, color visibility, and Shine) were then translated into technically measurable parameters of the hair fiber (Diffused light intensity, ratio of RGB channel intensities of Diffused light, and luster) via a single instrument-Hair SAMBA (a dual-polarized imaging system). Afterward, 10 carefully selected anchor shades were used as visual stimuli in an online pairwise comparison (PC) study with 100 Japanese stylists to generate quantitative transparency perception data of the swatches. Technical parameters of these swatches were measured by SAMBA and consolidated with the PC output, for the creation and validation of the mathematical model. After, with another PC study (N = 100) in China, with seven shades from Japan study and 6 additional Chinese market shades, the applicability of the model in China market was validated. CONCLUSION We have clarified and quantified the concept of hair transparency through a consumer centric approach and with objective data. Our findings will enable the development of optimum transparent shades which better suits consumer needs. Lastly, we would like to highlight the beauty of digitalization in the study: The digital evaluation pathways chosen allowed us to collect quantitative consumer data from two countries for the creation of a robust model under the impact of COVID-19 and would definitely be the way to go for our future consumer evaluation studies.","output":"Hair transparency decoding in Asia: From stylists' perception to in vitro measurement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.","output":"Social Contacts and Mixing Patterns Relevant to the Spread of Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular disease, the management of which requires the continuous provision of multidisciplinary therapies Owing to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, regular contact with ALS patients at our center was severely restricted and patient care was at risk by delay of supportive therapies We established a triage system based on the D50 disease progression model and were thus able to identify a prospective cohort with high disease aggressiveness (D50 &lt; 30) Thirty-seven patients with highly aggressive disease were actively offered follow-up, either via telephone or on-site, depending on their disease-specific needs and abilities We describe here the procedures, obstacles, and results of these prescient efforts during the restrictions caused by COVID-19 in the period between March and June 2020 In conclusion, four patients with highly aggressive disease were initiated with non-invasive ventilation and two received a gastrostomy We could show that a comparable amount of advanced care was induced in a retrospective cohort within a similar time period one year prior to the COVID-19 outbreak Our workflow to identify high-risk patients via D50 model metrics can be easily implemented and integrated within existing centers It helped to maintain a high quality of advanced care planning for our ALS patients","output":"Triage of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Application of the D50 Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Administration of a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria(R), AstraZeneca) is associated with a certain risk for vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.

Systemic symptoms of anaphylaxis from allergy, although rare, can be life threatening. Several decades ago it was inconceivable that an athlete who had asthma could perform competitively, let alone win Olympic gold medals. Today, with proper diagnosis, education, and optimal therapeutic management, the allergic athlete can achieve great strides in all sports endeavors. To avoid seasonal allergic flares and maximize performance, the physician providing care for an athlete who has seasonal allergies must be aware of the climatic patterns of aeroallergen expression, and adjust exercise and pharmacologic regimens accordingly.

RESULTS: Even prior to the pandemic, Black individuals were disproportionately impacted by psychosocial stress. However, the compounding effect of pre-existing and current pandemic psychosocial stressors may be a mechanism by which racial disparities are exacerbated and result in higher rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in Black women. CONCLUSION: We recommend continued monitoring of data related to racial disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity throughout the pandemic.

Underdiagnosis of depression has been attributed to many reasons, including stigma surrounding mental health, limited access to medical care, and barriers due to cost. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if low-burden personal health solutions, leveraging person-generated health data (PGHD), could represent a possible way to increase engagement and improve outcomes. METHODS: Here, we present the development of PSYCHE-D (Prediction of Severity Change-Depression), a predictive model developed using PGHD from more than 4000 individuals, which forecasts the long-term increase in depression severity. PSYCHE-D uses a 2-phase approach. The first phase supplements self-reports with intermediate generated labels, and the second phase predicts changing status over a 3-month period, up to 2 months in advance. The 2 phases are implemented as a single pipeline in order to eliminate data leakage and ensure results are generalizable. RESULTS: PSYCHE-D is composed of 2 Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithmCbased classifiers that use a range of PGHD input features, including objective activity and sleep, self-reported changes in lifestyle and medication, and generated intermediate observations of depression status. The approach generalizes to previously unseen participants to detect an increase in depression severity over a 3-month interval, with a sensitivity of 55.4% and a specificity of 65.3%, nearly tripling sensitivity while maintaining specificity when compared with a random model. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that low-burden PGHD can be the basis of accurate and timely warnings that an individuals mental health may be deteriorating.

Both the C15 and cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 S were palmitoylated. Fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75 and zinc finger DHHC domain-containing palmitoyltransferase (ZDHHC) inhibitor 2-BP reduced the palmitoylation of S.

METHODS: A mouse model of liver fibrosis induced by CCl(4) was conducted to assess the effect of resveratrol on liver fibrosis. The changes of gut microbiota in liver fibrotic mice after resveratrol intervention were assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The mechanism of the gut microbiota dysregulation in liver fibrosis was investigated by Sirius red staining, immunohistochemical assay, bacterial translocation (BT), EUB338 fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, trans-epithelial electrical resistance analysis and paracellular permeability analysis. RESULTS: Resveratrol relieved CCl(4)-induced liver fibrosis. Besides, resveratrol restrained the gut microbiota Staphylococcus_lentus and Staphylococcus_xylosus in the liver fibrotic mice, and the Staphylococcus_xylosus and Staphylococcus_lentus facilitated the occurrence of BT and the cultures of them enhanced the permeability of intestine. The in vivo assay corroborated that the excessive Staphylococcus_xylosus and Staphylococcus_lentus canceled the protecting effect of resveratrol on liver fibrosis, and Staphylococcus_xylosus or Staphylococcus_lentus alone had a limited impact on the liver injury of normal mice.

Hitherto, more than 45,374 cases and over 4300 deaths have been reported among COVID-19 patients across India from April 2021 to July 21, 2021.

In India, Rhizopus arrhizus has been related to be the most common species to cause human mucormycosis, followed by Apophysomyces variabilis, Rhizopus microsporus, and R. homothallicus. Accurate sample identification of human pathogenic Mucorales species is challenging especially due to the frequent lack of diagnostic morphological features. Traditionally, the culture-based approach has been extensively used to isolate and characterize human pathogenic Mucorales. However, this may not be an appropriate approach to objectively isolate and characterize all species, as the germination and growth of fungal spores are highly dependent on culture media and environmental conditions. Therefore, a robust approach to the accurate and rapid identification of human pathogenic Mucorales species is a prerequisite. The metagenomic approach comprehensively sequences and analyzes all genetic material in a complex biological sample and, consequently, this could be an appropriate approach to objectively characterize human pathogenic Mucorales taxa without the need for in vitro culture. The precise identification of the species will not only be useful for the correct diagnosis of this disease, but also for the development of antifungal drugs specific for each species.

This could impede established family-centered care and may affect the mental health of the next of kin. The aim of this study was to explore symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) in the next of kin of ICU patients. METHODS: In this prospective observational single-center study, next of kin of ICU patients were interviewed by telephone, using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to assess symptoms of acute stress disorder during the ICU stay and PTSD symptoms at 3 months after the ICU stay. The primary outcome was the prevalence of severe PTSD symptoms (IES-R score  33) at 3 months. The secondary outcomes comprised the IES-R scores during the ICU stay, at 3 months, and the prevalence of severe symptoms of acute stress disorder during ICU stay. An inductive content analysis was performed of the next of kins comments regarding satisfaction with patient care and the information they were given. RESULTS: Of the 411 ICU patients admitted during the study period, 62 patients were included together with their next of kin. An IES-R score > 33 was observed in 90.3% (56/62) of next of kin during the ICU stay and in 69.4% (43/62) 3 months later.

The aims of this study were to determine the accuracy of the latest generation ventilators to deliver chosen parameters in various typical conditions and to provide clinicians with a comprehensive report on their performance. METHODS Thirteen modern intensive care unit ventilators were evaluated on the ASL5000 test lung with and without leakage for: (i) accuracy to deliver exact tidal volume (VT) and PEEP in assist-control ventilation (ACV); (ii) performance of trigger and pressurization in pressure support ventilation (PSV); and (iii) quality of non-invasive ventilation algorithms. RESULTS In ACV, only six ventilators delivered an accurate VT and nine an accurate PEEP. Eleven devices failed to compensate VT and four the PEEP in leakage conditions. Inspiratory delays differed significantly among ventilators in invasive PSV (range 75-149 ms, P=0.03) and non-invasive PSV (range 78-165 ms, P<0.001). The percentage of the ideal curve (concomitantly evaluating the pressurization speed and the levels of pressure reached) also differed significantly (range 57-86% for invasive PSV, P=0.04; and 60-90% for non-invasive PSV, P<0.001). Non-invasive ventilation algorithms efficiently prevented the decrease in pressurization capacities and PEEP levels induced by leaks in, respectively, 10 and 12 out of the 13 ventilators. CONCLUSIONS We observed real heterogeneity of performance amongst the latest generation of intensive care unit ventilators. Although non-invasive ventilation algorithms appear to maintain adequate pressurization efficiently in the case of leakage, basic functions, such as delivered VT in ACV and pressurization in PSV, are often less reliable than the values displayed by the device suggest.","output":"Multifaceted bench comparative evaluation of latest intensive care unit ventilators."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, rapid and sensitive diagnosis of viral infection is a critical deterrent to the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

There is still limited psychological research on police officers, especially prison officers in the process of enforcing the law. The present study aims to identify prevalence and influencing factors on mental health status among frontline prison officers in China during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a sample of 981 frontline prison officers was conducted using snowball sampling approach. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 4 parts: (i) informed consent form;(ii) socio-demographic section;(iii) work and life situations during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic;(iv) the Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify factors influencing mental health status. Results: The prevalence of being prone to mental health problems (GHQ-12 score >= 4) was 33.43% among frontline prison officers. The results of GHQ-12 factors analysis indicated that the prison officers suffered from psychological issues was related to anxiety and depression, which main symptoms were unhappy and depressed, lost sleep over worry and constantly under strain. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that male (OR = 1.573, 95% CI:1.385-1.853), lockdown shift inside the prison(OR = 2.203, 95% CI:2.139-2.297), more night shifts (OR = 2.163, 95% CI:2.031-2.317;OR = 2.749, 95% CI:2.194-2.901), more smoking (OR = 1.100, 95% CI:1.037-2.168), poor self-reported physical condition (OR = 1.947, 95% CI:1.478-2.250), chronic or serious illness history(OR = 1.870, 95% CI:1.314-2.660;OR = 2.214, 95% CI:1.460-2.812) were risk factors for mental health among frontline prison officers, while regular diet (OR = 0.779, 95% CI:0.539-0.928), more physical exercise (OR = 0.702, 95% CI:0.548-0.899;OR = 0.641, 95% CI:0.316-0.887), more communication with family members (OR = 0.437, 95% CI:0.295-0.616) were protective factors. Conclusion: Chinese frontline prison officers experienced different psychological stress coming from the prevention and control of this epidemic. Therefore, continued surveillance of psychological problems and targeted mental health care for frontline prison officers were urgent.

HCoV-HKU1, a human coronavirus identified in a clinical sample from a patient with severe pneumonia, has been a major challenge for successful propagation on all immortalized cells tested to date. To determine if HCoV-HKU1 could replicate in in vitro models of human ciliated airway epithelial cell cultures (HAE) that recapitulate the morphology, biochemistry, and physiology of the human airway epithelium, the apical surfaces of HAE were inoculated with a clinical sample of HCoV-HKU1 (Cean1 strain). High virus yields were found for several days postinoculation and electron micrograph, Northern blot, and immunofluorescence data confirmed that HCoV-HKU1 replicated efficiently within ciliated cells, demonstrating that this cell type is infected by all human coronaviruses identified to date. Antiserum directed against human leukocyte antigen C (HLA-C) failed to attenuate HCoV-HKU1 infection and replication in HAE, suggesting that HLA-C is not required for HCoV-HKU1 infection of the human ciliated airway epithelium.

Here, we developed an rLCMV vaccine expressing the Mtb antigens TB10.4 and Ag85B. In mice, rLCMV elicited high frequencies of polyfunctional Mtb-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses. CD8 but not CD4 T cells were efficiently boosted upon vector re-vaccination.

Importantly, rLCMV immunization significantly reduced the lung Mtb burden upon aerosol challenge, resulting in improved lung ventilation. Protection was associated with increased CD8 T cell recruitment but reduced CD4 T cell infiltration upon Mtb challenge. When combining rLCMV with BCG vaccination in a heterologous prime-boost regimen, responses to the rLCMV-encoded Mtb antigens were further augmented, but protection was not significantly different from rLCMV or BCG vaccination alone.

We identified participants with a history of traditionally defined SE (TSE) (seizures 30 minutes) and operationally defined SE (OSE) (seizures 10 minutes) by chart review. We assessed familial aggregation of TSE and OSE using 2 analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS One hundred fifty-five (7%) participants in 1,043 families had 1 episode of TSE. Two hundred fifty (11%) had 1 episode of OSE. In a 2 analysis, the number of family units with 2 members having TSE (odds ratio [OR] 4.79, 95% CI 2.56-8.97) or OSE (OR 4.23, 95% CI 2.67-6.70) was greater than expected by chance. In GEE models adjusting for sex, broad epilepsy class (GE or NAFE), age at onset, and duration of epilepsy, TSE in a proband predicted TSE in a first-degree relative (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.24-6.22), and OSE in a proband predicted OSE in a first-degree relative (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.65-5.15). The results remained significant in models addressing epilepsy severity by incorporating the number of antiseizure medications used or epilepsy surgery.

As the approach uses the interrelationship of single cells for comparison, the resulting statistic is robust and capable of distinguishing between true biological variation and rotational symmetry generation during dimensionality reduction. Further, the test provides a valid distance between single cell datasets, allowing the organisation of multiple samples into a dendrogram for quantitative comparison of complex datasets.

Reduced immunity, combined with steroid usage to prevent a cytokine storm along with various pre\\\\existing comorbidities can prove to be fertile ground for various secondary bacterial and fungal infection, including mucormycosis. Diagnosis of Mucor is a challenging task given the high negativity rate of various detection methods.

(1,2) Although testing was initially focused on the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic patients, this effort has now expanded to include surveillance of asymptomatic patients in order to protect health care workers and prevent nosocomial infections. There is an urgent need to understand best practices for the delivery of routine medical care during an ongoing outbreak. (3) Here we report the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients screened prior to admission or a surgical or aerosolizing procedure. Methods Beginning March 30, 2020, our hospital began screening all asymptomatic patients prior to needed surgeries and aerosolizing procedures (n=350). On April 13, 2020, we expanded this practice to universal surveillance screening of all patients prior to admission (n=349). Testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using the Washington state emergency use authorized University of Washington CDC-based laboratory-developed test or FDA authorized DiaSorin Simplexa SARS-CoV-2, Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2, or Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 tests. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Washington Medical Center (STUDY00009734). Informed consent was not required. Results For patients undergoing surgical or aerosolizing procedures, 3 of 350 patients (0.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. For patients who were asymptomatic and tested at the time of admission, 3 of 349 patients (0.9%) were positive and 2 of 349 (0.6%) were inconclusive; inconclusive results were treated as low-level positives. For asymptomatic patients tested for any other reason (e.g. exposure risk), 12 of 157 patients (7.6%) were positive and 1 of 157 (0.6%) were inconclusive. Meanwhile, of the 473 inpatients in this period who had any symptom concerning for COVID-19, 68 of 473 patients (14.3%) were positive. There was a variety of ordering services and locations in all indication categories, with no particular predominating medical service or location. During this time period the outpatient prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 active infection in our region was 3-5% (manuscript in review). Discussion The application of universal surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients prior to surgery or aerosolizing procedure shows that the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 is low (<1%) in asymptomatic patients without known exposure risk factors. The positivity rate for asymptomatic patients on admission screen was similar; both measures were notably lower than recently reported measurements during an outbreak in New York City that found a positivity rate of 13.7% in asymptomatic pregnant women. (4) The rate of sub-clinical infection likely varies with the scale of the community outbreak. Even in the context of a community-wide outbreak, our data show a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the urgent pre-procedural setting. These data reflect the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population of individuals who use medical services and provide an assessment of exposure risk to other patients and healthcare workers around the time of admission. The Greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) also recently published results from the first 18 days of home-based testing and reported no positive tests in 1392 patients reporting no COVID-19-like illness. (5) Although other studies support a large proportion of asymptomatic infections, the data from this metropolitan outbreak do not support a similar pattern. Clinical providers, especially those involved in performing procedures that have a risk of aerosolization, are asking for methods to risk-assess patients prior to the procedure. Pre-procedure testing is one option to accomplish this goal. Importantly, in the midst of an outbreak, testing prior to procedures can decrease the use of PPE, identify appropriate precautions for patients, and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection.","output":"Pre-Procedural Surveillance Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in an Asymptomatic Population Shows Low Rates of Positivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To characterize hydroxychloroquine exposure in patients with rheumatic disease receiving long-term hydroxychloroquine compared to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against the 2019 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We evaluated total hydroxychloroquine concentrations in serum and plasma from published literature values, frozen serum samples from a pediatric lupus trial, and simulated concentrations using a published pharmacokinetic model during pregnancy. For each source, we compared observed or predicted hydroxychloroquine concentrations to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The average total serum/plasma hydroxychloroquine concentrations were below the lowest SARS-CoV-2 target of 0.48 mg/L in all studies. Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/L), all studies had approximately one-tenth the necessary concentration for in-vitro viral inhibition. Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose. CONCLUSION We found that the average patient receiving treatment with hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro. Nevertheless, patients receiving hydroxychloroquine long-term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma.

This scheme involved connecting current Core Surgical Trainees (CST) doctors with keen Foundation doctors interested in applying to CST. The intermediary, buddy scheme organisers matched juniors with the tutors based on shared interest and location.26 foundation doctors (FY) joined the scheme across seven sites. The FY two doctors were given priority and were matched up with 22 CST doctors. Feedback forms were distributed to collect qualitative and quantitative data regarding their participation. The Feedback summary forms showed that the most common used contact platform was zoom (35.7%) and texting for additional support (35.7%). The average hours of contact spent were 4.2 hours. The qualitative feedback data from the FY doctors showed all their initial pre-scheme objectives were met.Effective leadership led to the initializing and distribution of a Buddy network system to offer a one-to-one contact between applicant and tutor. The initiative of the original scheme led to a large team of tutor collectively supporting and guiding our cohort of applicants.The success of the scheme was recognized by the Nottingham University Hospital (NUH)NHS trust Postgraduate Medical Education Team (PMED).

Weick and Sutcliffe (Managing the unexpected: resilient performance in an age of uncertainty. Wiley, San Francisco, 2007 [1]) argue that unexpected events often audit our resilience. Everything that was left unprepared becomes a complex problem. Leadership plays a pivotal role in managing such crisis (whether they emerge as a black swan event (Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable.

The Covid-19 pandemic for example has resulted in considerable impact on global health security, human security and the global economy. As described in (OECD in A systemic resilience approach to dealing with Covid-19 and future shocks New Approaches to Economic Challenges, 2020 [4]), the pandemic has reminded us bluntly of the fragility of some of our most basic human-made systems. Shortages of masks, tests, ventilators and other essential items have left frontline workers and the general population dangerously exposed to the disease itself. At a wider level, we have witnessed the cascading collapse of entire production, financial, and transportation systems, due to a vicious combination of supply and demand shocks.

The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region suggests the possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that promoted cross-species transmission. Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants. Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function. It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases.

Even though all ICU patients are surveilled for healthcare-associated infections (HAI), there were concerns that the routine protocol might not be sufficient for IA detection. We reviewed the electronic patient charts of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2021 for fungal co- or superinfections, comparing four diagnostic algorithms based on different recommendations for the diagnosis of IA (according to EORTC/MSG, BM-AspICU, IAPA and CAPA) to our routine surveillance protocol.

While these findings are encouraging, given competing COVID-19 treatment approaches, it is unclear if statin use should be prioritized and if its use is a cost-effective treatment options for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this study, we report on a cost-effectiveness analysis of statin-containing treatment regimens for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare statin use and no statin use among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from a United States healthcare perspective. The cycle length was one week, with a time horizon of 4 weeks. A Monte Carlo microsimulation with 20,000 samples were used. All analyses were conducted using TreeAge Pro Healthcare Version 2021 R1.1. RESULTS: The mean cost for patients receiving statins in addition to usual care was $31,623 (SD $20,331), whereas the mean cost for patients not receiving statins was $33,218 (SD $25,440). The mean effectiveness for the two cohorts were 1.73 (SD 0.96) and 1.71 (SD 1.00), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated that treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with statins was both cheaper and more effective than treatment without statins; statin-containing therapy dominates over non-statin therapy. Statin medications for the treatment of COVID-19 should be further investigated in randomized controlled trials, especially considering its cost-effective nature.

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), Okinawa diet (OkD) and Nordic diet, derived from very different regions of the world and culinary traditions, have a large whole plant food component and are associated with reduced disease risk. This review focuses on polyphenola:amicrobiome interactions as one possible common mechanistic driver linking the protective effects whole plant foods against metabolic disease across healthy dietary patterns irrespective of geography. RECENT FINDINGS: Although mechanistic evidence in humans is still scarce, animal studies suggest that polyphenol or polyphenol rich foods induce changes within the gut microbiota and its metabolic output of trimethylamine N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and small phenolic acids. These cross-kingdom signaling molecules regulate mammalian lipid and glucose homeostasis, inflammation and energy storage or thermogenesis, physiological processes determining obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. However, it appears that where in the intestine metabolites are produced, the microbiota communities involved, and interactions between the metabolites themselves, can all influence physiological responses, highlighting the need for a greater understanding of the kinetics and site of production of microbial metabolites within the gut. SUMMARY: Interactions between polyphenols and metabolites produced by the gut microbiota are emerging as a possible unifying protective mechanism underpinning diverse healthy dietary patterns signaling across culinary traditions, across geography and across domains of life.","output":"Healthy dietary patterns to reduce obesity-related metabolic disease: polyphenol-microbiome interactions unifying health effects across geography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Pakistan reported more than a million cases during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, shuffling the already resource-constrained health system that is known for its high vulnerability and lack of adaption.

METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2007-2011) was utilized to analyze outcomes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing colorectal surgery. Main outcomes were risk-adjusted inpatient morbidity, mortality, hospital charge, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 6490 patients were identified. Utilization of laparoscopic surgery in Parkinson's patients has progressively increased in frequency over the latest 5 years analyzed. The most common diagnoses were colorectal malignancy (39 %) and intestinal obstruction (20 %). Right hemicolectomy (37 %) and sigmoidectomy (30 %) were the most common operations. Laparoscopy was used in 18 % of Parkinson's patients and most commonly in the elective setting. 54.3 % of Parkinson's patients had emergency surgery compared to 38.6 % in non-Parkinson's. Overall morbidity and mortality were significantly lower after laparoscopic surgery compared to open (20 vs. 25 % and 2.1 vs. 6.6 %, respectively). Length of stay was significantly shorter (OR -1.86; p < 0.01) for laparoscopic operations, but there were no significant differences in risk-adjusted outcomes between laparoscopic and open groups. CONCLUSION PD patients have high rates of morbidity and mortality after colorectal surgery; this may be because more than half of all patients in this population undergo emergent surgery.

It has a narrow therapeutic window and wide variation in individualized dosing, and is used clinically for the treatment of thromboembolic diseases. Due to the widespread use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China and the complex composition and diverse mechanisms of action of TCM, the combination of TCM and warfarin in patients has led to fluctuations in the international normalized ratio of warfarin or bleeding. To ensure rational clinical use, we summarize the TCMs with which warfarin interacts and the possible mechanisms, with a view to providing a clinical reference. Aim of the study: To summarize the mechanisms by which Chinese herbal medicines affect the enhancement or weakening of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, to provide theoretical references for clinicians and pharmacists to use warfarin safely and rationally, and to avoid the adverse effects associated with the combination of Chinese herbal medicines and warfarin. Methods: A computerized literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (WOS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WANFANG Data was performed. Key words used in the literature search were \\"warfarin\\", \\"Chinese medicine\\", \\"traditional Chinese medicine\\", \\"Chinese patent medicine\\" etc. and their combinations in a time limit from January 1, 1990 to May 1, 2021. A total of 64 articles were obtained following the selection process, including clinical reports, pharmacological experiments and in vitro experiments which were reviewed to determine the mechanism of the anticoagulant effect of herbal medicine on warfarin. Results: The mechanisms affecting the anticoagulant effect of warfarin are complex, and herbal medicines may enhance and diminish the anticoagulant effect of warfarin through a variety of mechanisms; thus, clinical use needs to be cautious. Some herbal medicines have shown inconsistent results in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments, pharmacology and clinical studies, and should be the focus of future research. Conclusion: With the widespread use of TCM, the combination of warfarin and TCM is more common.

It is currently unknown if the experience of lockdown leads to long term changes in individual's eating behaviors. The objectives of this study were: i) to derive longitudinal trajectories of change in eating during UK lockdown, and ii) to identify risk factors associated with eating behavior trajectories. METHOD: Data from 22,374 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social study (a panel study collecting weekly data during the pandemic) were analyzed from 28th March to 29th May 2020. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to derive trajectories of change in eating. These were then associated with prior socio-economic, health-related and psychological factors using multinomial regression models. RESULTS: Analyses suggested five trajectories, with the majority (64%) showing no change in eating. In contrast, one trajectory was marked by persistently eating more, whereas another by persistently eating less. Overall, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report any change in eating. Loneliness was linked to persistently eating more (OR = 1.07), whereas being single or divorced, as well as stressful life events, were associated with consistently eating less (OR = 1.69). Overall, higher education status was linked to lower odds of changing eating behavior (OR = 0.54-0.77). Secondary exploratory analyses suggest that participants self-reported to have overweight were more commonly categorised into the group consistently eating more, whereas participants with underweigh persistently ate less. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that one third of the sample report changes in quantities eaten throughout the first UK lockdown period. Findings highlight the importance of adjusting public health programs to support eating behaviors in future lockdowns both in this and potential future pandemics.

Understanding the true impact of VTE on patients with COVID-19 will potentially improve our ability to reach a timely diagnosis and initiate proper treatment, mitigating the risk for this susceptible population during a complicated disease.","output":"Venous Thromboembolism Complicated with COVID-19: What Do We Know So Far?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SETTING: As of June 10, 2020, 37 people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing in Calgary, Alberta, had developed lab-confirmed COVID-19. Spread occurred despite standard outbreak controls at affected shelter and supportive housing sites. Among these 37 cases, drink sharing was frequently identified as a modifiable mode of possible transmission. We collaborated with emergency shelters, a supportive housing site, and street and encampment outreach groups, using mixed service delivery by health staff, non-profits, and peers with lived experience with homelessness. INTERVENTION: To empower individuals to decrease COVID-19 transmission using a harm reduction approach, we provided disposable paper cups to service providers for distribution to clients. Service providers tracked the number of cups distributed. To assess effectiveness, we interviewed staff and peers who distributed the cups. OUTCOMES: Cup distribution was highest among populations with higher rates of alcohol use, and the intervention was well received by people who drink alcohol regularly, providing unique opportunities to promote COVID-19 awareness and safer drinking practices. Providers to these populations reported enthusiastic client engagement and repeat requests for cups for safer drinking. Intervention usefulness was limited in contexts with low alcohol consumption and in the absence of paired COVID-19 education. Provider reports suggest appropriate disposal of these cups after use. IMPLICATIONS: Disposable cups are a novel, rapidly implementable, low-cost harm reduction tool to empower people experiencing homelessness to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission due to drink sharing, ideally as part of a larger harm reduction and community education strategy.","output":"Cups for COVID: rapid implementation of a harm reduction initiative to support populations experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:SARS-COV-2 is a new Beta Corona virus discovered in China (December 2019).It is responsible for an international outbreak of respiratory illness termed COVID -19 ranging from self-limiting Respiratory Tract Illness to Severe Progressive Pneumonia, Multi Organ Failure and Death.

Recently, anticoagulation has shown to decrease mortality, but it is unclear whether this contributes to increased GI bleeding. The aims of this study are: (i) to examine whether there are risk factors for GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients and (ii) to study whether there is a mortality difference between hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without GI bleeding. METHODS: This is a propensity score matched case-control study from a large health system in the New York metropolitan area between March 1st and April 27th. COVID-19 patients with GI bleeding were matched 1:1 to COVID-19 patients without bleeding using a propensity score that took into account comorbidities, demographics, GI bleeding risk factors and length of stay. RESULTS: Of 11, 158 hospitalized with COVID-19, 314 patients were identified with GI bleeding. The point prevalence of GI bleeding was 3%. There were no identifiable risk factors for GI bleeding. Use of anticoagulation medication or antiplatelet agents was not associated with increased risk of GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients. For patients who developed a GI bleed during the hospitalization, there was an increased mortality risk in the GI bleeding group (OR 1.58, P = 0.02).

The purpose of this article is to analyze the didactic aspects of the experience of using EDL methods and technological tools during a pandemic, to assess the potential positive and real negativity of this process, to develop recommendations on the rational use of modern virtual learning environments. The study is based on methods of systemic analysis, pedagogical psychology and didacticism, long-term experience of authors in the field of EDL. The analysis of two main didactic approaches in the modern EDL was carried out: classes in a virtual classroom, most of which copy traditional methods of classroom learning, and predominantly independent cognitive activities of students in learning management systems using specially trained digital educational resources. It has been shown that much of the negative aspects of EDL during the coronavirus pandemic are due to attempts to implement rudiments of the usual classroom learning system with the help of innovative electronic technologies. Recommendations have been made on the structure of the electronic distance course in modern learning management systems, which provide for the freedom to choose the time and place of study with them with the necessary regulation of the content and the learning process inherent in formal education institutions. A number of positive aspects of EDL related to its quality, ever-widening application boundaries, educational potential and economic feasibility have been considered. The importance of properly assessing possible negative aspects of EDL is shown. The reason for which is not in electronic tools, but in didacticly incorrect methods of training with them. To create new teaching methods focused on innovative electronic tools, we need research of psychological and didactic aspects of EDL in the areas of student motivation, digital educational resources development, gamification, teacher training, etc. ? 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

An obligate intracellular pathogen, C. trachomatis employs a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) for host cell entry. The tip of the injectosome is composed of the protein CT584, which represents a potential target for neutralization with vaccine-induced antibody. Here, we investigate the immunogenicity and efficacy of a vaccine made of CT584 epitopes coupled to a bacteriophage virus-like particle (VLP), a novel platform for Chlamydia vaccines modeled on the success of HPV vaccines. Female mice were immunized intramuscularly, challenged transcervically with C. trachomatis, and assessed for systemic and local antibody responses and bacterial burden in the upper genital tract. Immunization resulted in a 3-log increase in epitope-specific IgG in serum and uterine homogenates and in the detection of epitope-specific IgG in uterine lavage at low levels. By contrast, sera from women infected with C. trachomatis and virgin controls had similarly low titers to CT584 epitopes, suggesting these epitopes are not systemically immunogenic during natural infection but can be rendered immunogenic by the VLP platform. C. trachomatis burden in the upper genital tract of mice varied after active immunization, yet passive protection was achieved when immune sera were pre-incubated with C. trachomatis prior to inoculation into the genital tract. These data demonstrate the potential for antibody against the T3SS to contribute to protection against C. trachomatis and the value of VLPs as a novel platform for C. trachomatis vaccines.","output":"Immunogenicity and Protective Capacity of a Virus-like Particle Vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis Type 3 Secretion System Tip Protein, CT584"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the deaths of healthcare professionals have been increasingly reported worldwide.

Dissection of its signaling mechanisms over the past decades has led to the discovery of several novel concepts, such as tissue-specific metabolism of Ang peptides. Identification and cloning of the various receptors through which Ang II acts on almost all tissues has led to the development of specific pharmacologic inhibitors with proven clinical benefit in patients with cardiovascular disorders. Work on the G-protein-coupled Ang II Type 1 receptor has demonstrated that different receptors interact through oligomerization, compartmentalization, and transactivation, and may explain how Ang II can activate G-protein-independent pathways. Unraveling the downstream effects of Ang II in specific cell types corroborates the importance of the cellular redox state on certain signaling pathways. Finally, the effects of Ang II on cell function and phenotype, such as the expression of inflammatory cytokines and receptors promoting the recruitment of inflammatory cells into vascular tissues, have indicated its role in local inflammation as a general pathogenetic basis of cardiovascular disease. The recognition of Ang II as a contributor to such fundamental pathophysiologic mechanisms, which are believed to be a common pathway for diverse cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and diabetes, has greatly advanced our knowledge of pathologic signaling in vascular tissues and may help to eventually define novel targets for pharmacologic interventions.","output":"Angiotensin II Signaling in Vascular Physiology and Pathophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Understanding the experiences of ICU patients with COVID-19 helps to provide the unique care activities, improve the quality of care and promote health status, thereby creating a window for mutual understanding between the treatment team and the patients.

The George W. Bush administration spearheaded national pandemic planning in 2005 as part of the post-September 11 efforts to modernize the countrys disaster response capabilities. Subsequent administrations revisited and revised the various pandemic plans, including the Trump administration as recently as 2017 and 2018. Despite these detailed plans, the Trump administration was slow to respond to the emerging public health crisis or implement any of the prescribed protocols. Federal officials lost valuable time as they downplayed the risk posed by COVID-19 and repeatedly assured the American people that the virus would simply go away. By March 2020, a frightening spike in cases in the Northeast made the pandemic impossible to ignore. President Trump and other administration officials shifted tactics and began to characterize COVID-19 as the quintessential black swan C a threat that no one could have foreseen. President Trump repeatedly told the American people that no one could have predicted something like this even though official federal policy suggested a very different story. Far from being a black swan, the COVID-19 pandemic was widely anticipated and, according to many epidemiologists, inevitable.This article argues that our botched federal response was not so much a failure of policy per se, but rather a failure of political will. The federal government had a robust pandemic policy in place;it simply chose not to follow it.

Adult somatization has been linked to childhood trauma in both men and women. Among women, sexual trauma affects somatization level to a greater extent than non-sexual trauma. Early diagnosis of a somatization disorder would be of great help for both patients and society. The purpose of this scoping review is to map and summarize the literature on symptoms within somatization in women who have been sexually abused, and if any specific symptom can be linked to previous sexual abuse. MATERIAL AND METHODS A scoping review methodology was used. The databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched for original qualitative and quantitative research published between 2008 and 2019 that matched the objectives of the review. RESULTS The database search identified 195 articles, of which 43 were retrieved in full text. Seven articles were included, involving 2076 women. All studies were quantitative. The included studies were heterogeneous. Four studies showed inconsistent findings regarding a link between sexual abuse and chronic or acute pain. Two studies showed an association between sexual abuse and increased incidence of somatic symptoms. One study showed an association between sexual abuse and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. No specific somatic symptoms in somatization were identifiable within the scope of this study. CONCLUSIONS This is to our knowledge the first scoping review on sexual abuse and symptoms of somatization.

A set of arms (or items) can be partitioned into various groups that are unknown. Within each group, the observations associated to each of the arms follow the same distribution with the same mean vector. At each time step, the agent queries or pulls an arm and obtains an independent observation from the distribution it is associated to. Subsequent pulls depend on previous ones as well as the previously obtained samples. The agent's task is to uncover the underlying partition of the arms with the least number of arm pulls and with a probability of error not exceeding a prescribed constant $\\\\delta$. The problem proposed finds numerous applications from clustering of variants of viruses to online market segmentation. We present an instance-dependent information-theoretic lower bound on the expected sample complexity for this task, and design a computationally efficient and asymptotically optimal algorithm, namely Bandit Online Clustering (BOC). The algorithm includes a novel stopping rule for adaptive sequential testing that circumvents the need to exactly solve any NP-hard weighted clustering problem as its subroutines. We show through extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets that BOC's performance matches the lower bound asymptotically, and significantly outperforms a non-adaptive baseline algorithm.","output":"Optimal Clustering with Bandit Feedback"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We find ourselves at our present crossroads with a well-traveled toolkit, perhaps too well worn but with aspirational hopes and dreams for the field of sleep neurotherapeutics.

We examined the emotional characteristics of over 92 million words spoken by Canadian Members of Parliament between 2006 and 2021. The analysis brought together the Warriner, Kuperman, and Brysbaert (Behav. Res., 2013, 45, 1191-1207) database of valence (positivity) ratings for English and the Canadian Hansard, which contains a transcription of parliamentary speech. Results revealed that the positivity of words used by politicians in parliament was significantly related to both political and social variables. Politicians increased the positivity of their language after the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. Within the time of the crisis, word positivity was linked statistically to month-by-month case counts, indicating a very fine-grained sensitivity to social realities. Our analysis also revealed a fine-grained sensitivity of word valence to political realities. As expected, parties in power used more positive language than those in opposition. In addition, our analysis revealed that individual parties have characteristic levels of word positivity and that those levels change in accordance with political changes as specific as whether or not the party in power holds a majority of seats in parliament. These findings suggest that the emotional properties of words used by Members of Parliament are reliably indexed to sociopolitical dynamics. The findings also suggest that the methodology of linking individual word ratings to Hansard Documents (which are used to document Parliamentary activities in over 25 countries) can provide a key tool for the understanding of specific crises such as the COVID-19 global pandemic as well as more general social and political trends across countries and languages. ?

While wastewater-based epidemiology has been implemented as an alternative/additional monitoring tool to reduce reporting bias, the relationship between passive and wastewater surveillance data has not yet been explicitly examined. As there is strong age dependency in the symptomatic ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infections, here, we aimed to estimate i) an age-dependent association between the number of reported cases and viral load in wastewater and ii) the time lag between these time series. The viral load in wastewater was modeled as a combination of contributions from virus shedding by different age groups, incorporating the delay, and fitted with daily case count data collected from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater recorded by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. The estimated lag between the time series of viral loads in wastewater and of reported cases was 10.8 (95% confidence interval: 10.2C11.6) and 8.8 (8.4C9.1) days for the northern and southern areas of the wastewater treatment plant, respectively. The estimated contribution rate of a reported case to the viral load in wastewater in the 0C19 yr age group was 0.38 (0.35C0.41) and 0.40 (0.37C0.43) for the northern and southern areas, and that in the 80+ yr age group was 0.67 (0.65C0.69) and 0.51 (0.49C0.52) for the northern and southern areas, respectively. The estimated lag between these time series suggested the predictability of reported cases 10 days later using viral loads in wastewater.

Recent outcomes indicate that aspects of nutrition, especially lipids (exogenous or endogenous), can influence the gut microbiota composition and consequently, play an important role in the metabolic health of the host. Thus, there is an increasing interest in applying holistic analytical approaches, such as lipidomics, metabolomics, (meta)transcriptomics, (meta)genomics, and (meta)proteomics, to thoroughly study the gut microbiota and any possible interplay with nutritional or endogenous components. This review firstly summarizes the general background regarding the interactions between important non-polar dietary (i.e., sterols, fat-soluble vitamins, and carotenoids) or amphoteric endogenous (i.e., eicosanoids, endocannabinoids-eCBs, and specialized pro-resolving mediators-SPMs) lipids and gut microbiota. In the second stage, through the evaluation of a vast number of dietary clinical interventions, a comprehensive effort is made to highlight the role of the above lipid categories on gut microbiota and vice versa. In addition, the present status of lipidomics in current clinical interventions as well as their strengths and limitations are also presented. Indisputably, dietary lipids and most phytochemicals, such as sterols and carotenoids, can play an important role on the development of medical foods or nutraceuticals, as they exert prebiotic-like effects. On the other hand, endogenous lipids can be considered either prognostic indicators of symbiosis or dysbiosis or even play a role as specialized mediators through dietary interventions, which seem to be regulated by gut microbiota.","output":"Effects of Non-Polar Dietary and Endogenous Lipids on Gut Microbiota Alterations: The Role of Lipidomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic brought serious illness and death into close proximity for a large number of people, whether through personal experience, infection in family members or friends, or unremitting media coverage on the effects of the virus and widespread mortality. Because of a collective vulnerability to illness and the heightened possibility of death, more people began to contemplate what kinds of medical care they would want if they ever became seriously ill. In other words, more people began the process of advance care planning (ACP). This symposium explores how the COVID-19 pandemic shifted interest in and execution of ACP across a range of groups. The first presentation reviews survey data from a large, community-based sample of older adults about their ACP conversations before and after the start of the pandemic. Shifting to the experience of clinicians, the second presentation summarizes a survey with multidisciplinary healthcare professionals about ACP conversations in their personal lives during the pandemic and how their observations of patients influenced their own plans. The third presentation describes the reactions of undergraduate students to an ACP class exercise, including COVID-19 as a motivating factor for pursuing ACP. The final presentation concludes with a review of two clinical cases that illustrate how COVID-19 has upended traditional ACP and highlighted the need for new policies and processes, with a particular focus on ethics and equity.

In healthcare, significant changes were made to reallocate resources to cater to an increasing number of hospital admissions and prevent infection spread. Reallocation of the health care staff led to the scarcity of care in outpatient facilities, including infusion centers, until the widespread adoption of Telehealth. Treating lung cancer patients with immunochemotherapy and radiotherapy has been incredibly challenging due to the pandemic, especially in regard to balancing malignancy treatment with limiting exposure of vulnerable patients to acute lifethreatening infection. In addition, being unable to provide appropriate treatment to cancer patients can result in decreased functional capacity, loss of treatment window, and increased mortality. A multidisciplinary approach can prevent these outcomes by anticipating challenges early and streamlining resources appropriately to provide better patient care. In this study, we aimed to assess the adherence of NCCN guidelines for lung cancer at a community hospital in Philadelphia during the pandemic. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of patients diagnosed and receiving active treatment for primary lung cancer between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, at Mercy Catholic Medical Center. Fifty cases of primary lung cancer undergoing active treatment were identified. Type and staging of lung cancer, NCCN guidelines' adherence, COVID-19 exposure, and missed treatments were reviewed and analyzed. Results: Of the 50 cases reviewed, 92% had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 8% had small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Among NSCLC, 72% had adenocarcinoma, 12% had squamous cell carcinoma, and 8% had large cell carcinoma. Stage IV lung cancer consisted of 46%, followed by 34% of stage I, 14% of stage III, and 6% of stage II. NCCN guideline-directed treatment was initiated in 88% (44/50) of the total patients, with the remaining 12% of the patients either refusing treatment (8%) or were lost to followup (4%). COVID-19 infection was diagnosed in 35% of the patients, of which 60% missed less than two chemotherapy sessions and 40% of COVID-19 positive patients who required hospitalization missed more than two cycles. 28% of patients missed treatment sessions due to other factors. This resulted in 61% (27/44) of patients having a disruption in NCCN guidelinedirected treatment at some point during the pandemic. Conclusions: Our study results reflect upon the need for developing effective strategies in managing cancer patients. When possible, switching to oral regimens, redefining regimen administration intervals, postponing invasive investigations for asymptomatic patients, and utilizing telemedicine as appropriate should be considered.","output":"Assessment of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline adherence for lung cancer in a community teaching hospital during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AJOL Abstract: This study is aimed at analyzing and monitoring the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria using some selected statistical tools The data used for the study comprised of daily reported new cases of the pandemic as of 18th August 2020 The data was sourced from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) Some time-series models were used to estimate the trend and make forecasts of the prevalence of the pandemic while control charts were employed in monitoring the variations in the mean number of new COVID-19 cases reported daily The Individual values, MovingAverage and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control charts were employed for this purpose The study revealed that, although efforts to contain the spread of the virus are yielding some positive results, the daily spread of the virus in Nigeria is out of control It was recommended that the government should intensify measures to curb the spread of the virus in the country","output":"A retrospective analysis and monitoring of the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent viral pandemic in Wuhan, Hubei, China has led to the identification of a new species of beta-coronavirus, able to infect humans, the 2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome named COVID-19, which presents with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia, with acute respiratory distress syndrome and frequent death All age groups are susceptible to the infection, but children, especially infants, seem to be partially spared, having a more favorable clinical course than other age groups There is currently no clear evidence showing vertical transmission and intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 infection in fetuses of women developing COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, and even if transmission is possible, the SARS-CoV2 positivity of the mother does not require delivery by caesarean section, does not contraindicate the management of the infant in rooming-in and allows breastfeeding This review provides an overview on the biology of the virus, on the pathogenesis of the infection, with particular attention to pregnancy and neonatal age, on the clinical presentation of infection in newborns and young infants and summarizes the international recommendations currently available on the clinical care of neonates with SARS-CoV2 infection or at risk of catching the virus The main objective of the review is to provide an update especially focused to the clinical management of COVID-19 infection in the perinatal and neonatal age","output":"Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Practical Tips"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosing and treating acute coronary syndromes consumes a significant fraction of the healthcare budget worldwide.

A key factor in this is detection of behavioral types. The use of a previously developed technique for fingerprinting the behavior of game playing agents, even complex ones, permits the modelling of control strategies with necrotic behavioral control (NBC). NBC consists of reducing the fitness of agents engaging in an unacceptable behavior. The impact of applying necrosis to a number of agent behaviors is investigated. The strategies always-defect, always-cooperate, and tit-for-two-tats are used as the foci for behavior control by zeroing out the fitness of agents whose behavior is similar to those agents. Our experiments demonstrate that NBC changes the distribution of prisoner's dilemma strategies that arise both when the focal strategy is changed and when the similarity radius used to zero out agent fitness is changed.

Tailoring services to the needs of this population requires careful work to identify, monitor and evaluate areas of care;however, published work in this area to guide service priorities is limited. This paper presents work done by the Australian Youth Cancer Services to operationalise and deliver quality care to adolescents and young adults with cancer, focusing on nationally coordinated service improvement initiatives and activity data collection in four areas that are of particular concern to young people diagnosed with cancer: clinical trial enrolment, oncofertility, psychosocial care and survivorship. This account may be instructive for health services seeking to improve the delivery and monitoring of cancer care provided to adolescents and young adults. AbstractAdolescents and young adults (aged 15C25 years) diagnosed with cancer have unique medical and psychosocial experiences and care needs, distinct from those of paediatric and older adult patients. Since 2011, the Australian Youth Cancer Services have provided developmentally appropriate, multidisciplinary and comprehensive care to these young patients, facilitated by national service coordination and activity data collection and monitoring. This paper reports on how the Youth Cancer Services have conceptualised and delivered quality youth cancer care in four priority areas: clinical trial participation, oncofertility, psychosocial care and survivorship. National activity data collected by the Youth Cancer Services between 2016C17 and 2019C20 are used to illustrate how service monitoring processes have facilitated improvements in coordination and accountability across multiple indicators of quality youth cancer care, including clinical trial participation, access to fertility information and preservation, psychosocial screening and care and the transition from active treatment to survivorship. Accounts of both service delivery and monitoring and evaluation processes within the Australian Youth Cancer Services provide an exemplar of how coordinated initiatives may be employed to deliver, monitor and improve quality cancer care for adolescents and young adults.","output":"The Australian Youth Cancer Service: Developing and Monitoring the Activity of Nationally Coordinated Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the world is suffering from the deadliest consequences of COVID-19, people with autism find themselves in the worst possible situation The patients of autism lack social skills, and in many cases, show repetitive behavior Many of them need outside support throughout their life During the COVID-19 pandemic, as many of the places are in lockdown conditions, it is very tough for them to find help from their doctors and therapists Suddenly, the caregivers and parents of the ASD patients find themselves in a strange situation Therefore, we are proposing an artificial intelligence-based system that uses sensor data to monitor the patients condition, and based on the emotion and facial expression of the patient, adjusts the learning method through exciting games and tasks Whenever something goes wrong with the patients behavior, the caregivers and the parents are alerted about it We then presented how this AI-based system can help them during COVID-19 pandemic This system can help the parents to adjust to the new situation and continue the mental growth of the patients ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"A Monitoring System for Patients of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 57-year-old man who had been intubated and placed on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia was transferred to our facility.

TRALI is one of the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities and specific therapies are unavailable. Neutrophils are recognized as the major pathogenic cells, whereas T regulatory cells and dendritic cells appear to be important for protection against TRALI. The pathogenesis, however, is complex and incompletely understood. It is frequently postulated that the complement system plays an important role in the TRALI pathogenesis. In this article, we assess the evidence regarding the involvement of complement in TRALI from both human and animal studies. We hypothesize about the potential connection between the complement system and neutrophils in TRALI. Additionally, we draw parallels between TRALI and other acute pulmonary disorders of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome regarding the involvement of complement. We conclude that, even though a role for complement in the TRALI pathogenesis seems plausible, studies investigating the role of complement in TRALI are remarkably limited in number and also present conflicting findings. Different types of TRALI animal models, diverse experimental conditions, and the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota may perhaps all be factors which contribute to these discrepancies. More systematic studies are warranted to shed light on the contribution of the complement cascade in TRALI. The underlying clinical condition of the patient, which influences the susceptibility to TRALI, as well as the transfusion factor (antibody-mediated vs nonCantibody-mediated), will be important to take into consideration when researching the contribution of complement. This should significantly increase our understanding of the role of complement in TRALI and may potentially result in promising new treatment strategies.","output":"The Role of Complement in Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the article is to show the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activities of small enterprises on the example of business customers of a manufacturing company.

PARTICIPANTS: All HCWs currently working in an environment with direct exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection are eligible to participate in the trial. The trial aims to be conducted across 20-30 centres (public and private hospitals) in India. HCWs who decline consent, who have a confirmed COVID-19 infection, those who are already on chloroquine/HCQ for any indication, or if pregnant or breast-feeding, or have known QT prolongation or are on medications that when taken with HCQ can prolong the QTc will be excluded. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The interventions to be compared in this trial are standard practice (use of recommended PPE) and HCQ plus standard practice. In the standard practice arm, HCWs will use recommended PPE as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles. They will be discouraged from taking HCQ to prevent contamination and contacted every week for the duration of the study to ascertain if they have taken any HCQ. Any such use will be reported as a protocol violation. In the intervention arm, HCWs will be administered 800mg of HCQ as a loading dose on the day of randomization (as two 400mg doses 12hrs apart) and subsequently continued on 400mg once a week for 12 weeks. This will be in addition to the use of recommended PPE as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles. HCWs will collect the drug once every week from designated research and pharmacy staff at site. A weekly phone reminder will be provided to participants in this arm to ensure compliance. An ECG will be performed between 4-6 weeks in this arm and if the QTc is prolonged (greater than 450milliseconds), the drug will be stopped. Follow-up will however continue. Participants in both arms will receive a weekly phone call for evaluation of the primary outcome, to monitor protocol compliance and development of any adverse events (in the HCQ group). MAIN OUTCOMES: Participants will be followed on a weekly basis. The primary outcome is the proportion of HCWs developing laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection within 6 months of randomization. We will also evaluate a number of secondary outcomes, including hospitalization related to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection, intensive care unit or high-dependency unit admission due to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection, all-cause mortality, need for organ support ( non-invasive or invasive ventilation, vasopressors and renal replacement therapy), ICU and hospital length of stay, readmission, days off work and treatment-related adverse events. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be conducted through a password-protected, secure website using a central, computer-based randomisation program. Randomisation will be stratified by participating institutions and by the role of HCW - nursing, medical and other. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to either standard practice only or HCQ plus standard practice. Allocation concealment is maintained by central web-based randomisation BLINDING (MASKING): This is an unblinded study: study assigned treatment will be known to the research team and participant. Bias will be mitigated through an objective end point (laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection). NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 6,950 HCWs will be enrolled (3475 to the intervention) and (3475 to the standard practice group) to detect a 25% relative reduction, or 2.5% absolute reduction, in the infection rate from an estimated baseline infection rate of 10%, with 80% statistical power using a two-sided test at 5% level of significance. Available data from China and Italy indicate that the rate of infection among frontline healthcare workers varies between 4% to 12%. We therefore assumed a baseline infection rate of 10% among HCWs. This sample size allows for a potential loss to follow-up rate of 10% and a potential non-compliance rate of 10% in both the treatment and control arms.

Here, we assess the carbon footprint of household consumption in Japan during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (JanuaryCMay 2020), which were characterized by moderate confinement measures. The associated lifestyle changes did not have a significant effect on the overall household carbon footprint compared with 2015C2019 levels. However, there were significant trade-offs between individual consumption categories such that the carbon footprint increased for some categories (e.g., eating at home) or declined (e.g., eating out, transportation, clothing, and entertainment) or remained relatively unchanged (e.g., housing) for others. Furthermore, carbon footprint patterns between age groups were largely consistent with 2015C2019 levels. However, changes in food-related carbon footprints were visible for all age groups since March and, in some cases, since February. Graphical Science for society Households are major sources of greenhouse gase (GHG) emissions both directly through energy use for transport, heating, and other activities and indirectly through emissions embedded in the goods and services they consume. Changes in lifestyles and consumption patterns can have major ramifications for GHG emissions. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed profound and rapid lifestyle shifts, which makes it a natural experiment for studying the outcomes of such changes for GHG emissions. Despite shifts in the work, socialization, and consumption practices of Japanese households during the early stages of the pandemic (JanuaryCMay 2020), the overall changes in carbon footprints were negligible. Despite some trade-offs between consumption categories, the general carbon footprint patterns remained similar to 2015C2019 trends and are consistent among age groups. This has implications for decarbonization efforts in that the environmental benefits of changes in consumption patterns might not materialize automatically and be easily reversible. The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant changes in the lifestyles and household consumption patterns of Japanese households. However, these changes had negligible effects on household carbon footprints both on aggregate and in age-differentiated terms. Despite some trade-offs between consumption categories, carbon footprints reversed rapidly to the levels observed in previous years.","output":"Negligible impacts of early COVID-19 confinement on household carbon footprints in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We review the organization and contents of the 20th Gatherings in Biosemiotics.

Younger patients show the strongest effects of MHC-based driver mutation selection, with younger females showing compounded effects and nearly twice as much MHC-II based selection.

Such panics can be ascribed to the seemingly deceptive features of the COVID-19: compared to other deadly viral outspreads, it has medium transmission and mortality rates. As a result, the severity of the causative coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was deeply underestimated by the society at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on this, in this review, we define the viruses with features similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 as the Panic Zone viruses. To contain those viruses, accurate and fast diagnosis followed by effective isolation and treatment of patients are pivotal at the early stage of virus breakouts. This is especially true when there is no cure or vaccine available for a transmissible disease, which is the case for current COVID-19 pandemic. As of January 2021, more than two hundred kits for the COVID-19 diagnosis on the market are surveyed in this review, while emerging sensing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed. It is of critical importance to rationally use these kits for the efficient management and control of the Panic Zone viruses. Therefore, we discuss guidelines to select diagnostic kits at different outbreak stages of the Panic Zone viruses, SARS-CoV-2 in particular. While it is of utmost importance to use nucleic acid-based detection kits with low false negativity (high sensitivity) at the early stage of an outbreak, the low false positivity (high specificity) gains its importance at later stages of the outbreak. When a society is set to reopen from the lock-down stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critical to have antibody based immunoassay kits with high specificity to identify people who can safely return to the society after their recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Given that the emergence of mutant viruses at the beginning of 2021 has complicated current battle against the COVID-19, we also discussed approaches and guidelines to detect viral mutants in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic that started at the end of 2020. Finally, since a massive attack from a viral pandemic requires a massive defense from the whole society, we urge both government and private sectors to research and develop more affordable and reliable point-of-care testing (POCT) kits, which can be used massively by the general public (and therefore called as massive POCT) to contain Panic Zone viruses in future.","output":"Detecting the Coronavirus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A global public health emergency triggered by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic may have are markable psychological impact on the population. There is still limited psychological research on police officers, especially prison officers in the process of enforcing the law. The present study aims to identify prevalence and influencing factors on mental health status among frontline prison officers in China during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with a sample of 981 frontline prison officers was conducted using snowball sampling approach. The self-administered questionnaire consisted of 4 parts: (i) informed consent form; (ii) socio-demographic section; (iii) work and life situations during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic; (iv) the Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify factors influencing mental health status. RESULTS: The prevalence of being prone to mental health problems (GHQ-12 score  4) was 33.43% among frontline prison officers. The results of GHQ-12 factors analysis indicated that the prison officers suffered from psychological issues was related to anxiety and depression, which main symptoms were unhappy and depressed, lost sleep over worry and constantly under strain.

We test three sets of hypotheses about change over time within a relationship, using relationship-level within-between models, which compare a couple's contraceptive behaviors across different times in the relationship. First, we find that a couple is less likely to use contraception when the relationship is more intimate and/or committed and that a couple becomes less likely to use contraception over time, regardless of intimacy and commitment. Second, we find that a couple using contraception becomes increasingly likely to choose hormonal over coital methods, but this change occurs as a relationship endures and is unrelated to intimacy and/or commitment. Third, we find that a condom-using couple's consistency does not decline when there is conflict; rather, consistency of condom use declines over time regardless of the relationship's characteristics. We also demonstrate that conflict and power imbalance increase reliance on hormonal methods among those using contraception; conflict decreases consistency among withdrawal (but not condom) users; and nonmonogamy increases reliance on condoms and decreases withdrawal consistency.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications were considered as cases. Controls were defined as COVID-19 patients without major complications (discharged). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between the exposures (periodontitis, demographics and medical conditions) and outcomes (COVID-19 complications). The association was adjusted for possible confounding factors. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were performed to account for stronger risk factors of the determined complications. The results were reported using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Laboratory data (blood parameters concerning the course of COVID-19) were also compared between the case and control groups. Results The patients were divided into 40 cases and 528 controls. Among the patients with periodontitis, 12.8% (33/258) went through COVID-19 complications, whereas 2.2% (7/310) of those without periodontitis experienced complications. The adjusted OR of patients with periodontitis was 3.67 (95% CI 1.46-9.27) for all COVID-19 complications, 8.81 (95% CI 1.00-77.7) for death, 3.54 (95% CI 1.39-9.05) for intensive care unit admission and 4.57 (95% CI 1.19-17.4) for the need of assisted ventilation. After conducting subgroup analyses for age, diabetes and smoking, periodontitis was still significantly associated with all the outcomes. Laboratory biomarkers (haemoglobin A1c, white blood cells and C-reactive protein) had higher levels in COVID-19 patients with periodontitis than those without periodontal disease.

To study pulmonary involvement in detail, one of the most common resources is the use of different lung imaging modalities (like chest radiography) to explore the possible affected areas. METHODS: The study of patient characteristics like sex and age in pathologies of this type is crucial for gaining knowledge of the disease and for avoiding biases due to the clear scarcity of data when developing representative systems. In this work, we performed an analysis of these factors in chest X-ray images to identify biases. Specifically, 11 imbalance scenarios were defined with female and male COVID-19 patients present in different proportions for the sex analysis, and 6 scenarios where only one specific age range was used for training for the age factor. In each study, 3 different approaches for automatic COVID-19 screening were used: Normal vs COVID-19, Pneumonia vs COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 vs COVID-19. The study was validated using two public chest X-ray datasets, allowing a reliable analysis to support the clinical decision-making process. RESULTS: The results for the sex-related analysis indicate this factor slightly affects the system in the Normal VS COVID-19 and Pneumonia VS COVID-19 approaches, although the identified differences are not relevant enough to worsen considerably the system. Regarding the age-related analysis, this factor was observed to be influencing the system in a more consistent way than the sex factor, as it was present in all considered scenarios. However, this worsening does not represent a major factor, as it is not of great magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple studies have been conducted in other fields in order to determine if certain patient characteristics such as sex or age influenced these deep learning systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, this study has not been done for COVID-19 despite the urgency and lack of COVID-19 chest x-ray images.

Although the clinical and laboratory characteristics of this illness have been reported in patients from China and Europe, data are scant in the United States. Methods We extracted data regarding all patients hospitalized at our hospital with COVID-19 infection between March 1 and April 4, 2020. Presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, and complications were recorded from electronic medical records (EMRs). The primary composite endpoint was admission to intensive care unit (ICU), shock, or death. Results We had a total of 43 patients tested for COVID-19 at the emergency room (ER) or during hospitalization, 16 (37%) of whom were admitted with COVID-19 infection. The mean age was 65.5 years and 75% were males. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (88%), and dyspnea (81%). A loss of smell and taste sensations were reported by three (19%) patients. Low oxygen saturation was present in 38% of patients, whilst 31% were hypotensive on admission. Hyponatremia (50%), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 100%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 80%) were common.

For bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and related viruses, binding to cell surface components containing N-acetyl-9- O-acetylneuraminic acid is essential for initiation of an infection. These viruses resemble influenza C viruses because they share not only the receptor determinant, but also the presence of an acetylesterase that releases the 9- O-acetyl group from sialic acid and thus abolishes the ability of the respective sialoglycoconjugate to function as a receptor for BCoV. As in the case of influenza viruses, the receptor-destroying enzyme of BCoV is believed to facilitate the spread of virus infection by removing receptor determinants from the surface of infected cells and by preventing the formation of virus aggregates. Another coronavirus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) preferentially recognizes N-glycolylneuraminic acid. TGEV does not contain a receptor-destroying enzyme and does not depend on the sialic acid binding activity for infection of cultured cells. However, binding to sialic acids is required for the enteropathogenicity of TGEV. Interaction with sialoglycoconjugates may help the virus to pass through the sialic acid-rich mucus layer that covers the viral target cells in the epithelium of the small intestine. We discuss that the BCoV group of viruses may have evolved from a TGEV-like ancestor by acquiring an acetylesterase gene through heterologous recombination.","output":"Sialic acids as receptor determinants for coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may exacerbate existing racial/ethnic inequities in preterm birth.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 8026 Black, Latina, and White women who gave birth during the study period. A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of Black vs White disparities in VPTB or PTB in a pandemic cohort was compared with a prepandemic cohort by using electronic medical records obtained from 2 hospitals in New York City. Exposures: Women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2020, were considered the pandemic cohort, and women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2019, were considered the prepandemic cohort. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were performed using samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab at the time of admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical estimates of gestational age were used to calculate VPTB (<32 weeks) and PTB (<37 weeks). Log binomial regression was performed to estimate Black vs White risk differences, pandemic cohort vs prepandemic cohort risk difference, and an interaction term representing the DID estimator. Covariate-adjusted models included age, insurance, prepregnancy body mass index, and parity. Results: Of 3834 women in the pandemic cohort, 492 (12.8%) self-identified as Black, 678 (17.7%) as Latina, 2012 (52.5%) as White, 408 (10.6%) as Asian, and 244 (6.4%) as other or unspecified race/ethnicity, with approximately half the women 25 to 34 years of age. The prepandemic cohort comprised 4192 women with similar sociodemographic characteristics. In the prepandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.4% (20 of 451) and PTB risk was 14.4% (65 of 451) among Black infants compared with 0.8% (17 of 2188) VPTB risk and 7.1% (156 of 2188) PTB risk among White infants. In the pandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.3% (21 of 491) and PTB risk was 13.2% (65 of 491) among Black infants compared with 0.5% (10 of 1994) VPTB risk and 7.0% (240 of 1994) PTB risk among White infants. The DID estimators indicated that no increase in Black vs White disparities were found (DID estimator for VPTB, 0.1 additional cases per 100 [95% CI, -2.5 to 2.8]; DID estimator for PTB, 1.1 fewer case per 100 [95% CI, -5.8 to 3.6]). The results were comparable in covariate-adjusted models when limiting the population to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. No change was detected in Latina vs White PTB disparities during the pandemic.

Data were collected daily during the first 7 days in the ICUs, and patients were followed up for 28 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was mortality at 28 days after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included rate of SARS-related critical illness, number of tertiary care ICUs and staff placed under quarantine, and number of health care workers (HCWs) contracting SARS secondary to ICU-acquired transmission. RESULTS Of 196 patients with SARS, 38 (19%) became critically ill, 7 (18%) of whom were HCWs. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of the 38 patients was 57.4 (39.0-69.6) years. The median (IQR) duration between initial symptoms and admission to the ICU was 8 (5-10) days. Twenty-nine (76%) required mechanical ventilation and 10 of these (34%) experienced barotrauma. Mortality at 28 days was 13 (34%) of 38 patients and for those requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 13 (45%) of 29. Six patients (16%) remained mechanically ventilated at 28 days.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers indexed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science and pre-prints in Europe PMC through August 12 th, 2020 that described cases of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference. RESULTS: Five identified studies found that a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections have occurred outdoors (<10%) and the odds of indoor transmission was very high compared to outdoors (18.7 times; 95% CI 6.0, 57.9). Five studies described influenza transmission outdoors and two described adenovirus transmission outdoors. There was high heterogeneity in study quality and individual definitions of outdoor settings which limited our ability to draw conclusions about outdoor transmission risks. In general, factors such as duration and frequency of personal contact, lack of personal protective equipment and occasional indoor gathering during a largely outdoor experience were associated with outdoor reports of infection. CONCLUSION: Existing evidence supports the wide-held belief that the the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is lower outdoors but there are significant gaps in our understanding of specific pathways.","output":"Outdoor Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Respiratory Viruses, a Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Planning occupational health and wellness services and support directed toward low-wage, essential workers in the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a number of challenges across work settings.

The TCSs are generally non-essential for life, but control many virulence and antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. This, along with their absence in animals makes the TCSs an attractive target for antimicrobial therapy, whether as a stand-alone treatments or adjuvants for existing therapies.

To address the shortage of psychiatrists (and nurse practitioners and physician assistants) in emergency settings (ESs), the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry (AAEP) has established recommendations for utilizing nonprescribing mental health professionals in the evaluation and management of psychiatric patients in these contexts. METHODS: Faced with limited research on the roles and competencies of nonprescribing psychiatric emergency clinicians (PECs), a multidisciplinary committee of members of AAEP was tasked with developing recommendations for use of PECs. RESULTS: The committee developed eight recommendations regarding the role of PECs in evaluation and management of patients who present to ESs with behavioral emergencies. PECs should have the following competencies: conducting independent psychiatric and substance abuse evaluations; managing behavioral emergencies; aiding in the recognition of confounding medical illnesses, intoxication and withdrawal states, and adverse drug reactions; developing appropriate treatment plans; recognizing when consultation from a psychiatrist or emergency physician is indicated; possessing self-awareness and recognizing clinician-patient dynamics; understanding medicolegal issues, such as involuntary holds and decision-making capacity; and collaborating with clinical teams in ESs. PECs are not meant to replace psychiatrists but to extend the psychiatrist's reach. Use of PECs has already been implemented in some areas of the country. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the AAEP recommendations, ESs can address staffing shortages while ensuring safe management of patients with behavioral emergencies.

Lignin is a water-insoluble dietary fiber, but it is second only to cellulose in abundance. Celery is the main source of dietary fiber, but its quality and production are limited by various abiotic stresses. Here, AgNAC1 containing the NAM domain was identified from celery. AgNAC1 was found to be a nuclear protein. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants hosting AgNAC1 have longer root lengths and stomatal axis lengths than the wide type (WT). The evidence from lignin determination and expression levels of lignin-related genes indicated that AgNAC1 plays a vital role in lignin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the results of the physiological characterization and the drought and salt treatments indicate that AgNAC1-overexpressing plants are significantly resistive to salt stress. Under drought and salt treatments, the AgNAC1 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants presented increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and size of stomatal apertures relatively to the WT plants. The AgNAC1 served as a positive regulator in inducing the expression of stress-responsive genes.

However, next-generation vaccine design efforts have been complicated by challenges including the genetic plasticity of the virus and the immunodominance of certain epitopes in its glycoprotein antigens. Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens display 20 hemagglutinin (HA) trimers in a highly immunogenic array, and their assembly in vitro enables precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct HAs in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens displaying the four HAs of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) elicited hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody responses to vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent or superior to commercial QIV in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates. The nanoparticle immunogensbut not QIVsimultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses, including H5N1 and H7N9, by targeting the subdominant yet conserved HA stem. Unlike previously reported influenza vaccine candidates, our nanoparticle immunogens can alter the intrinsic immunodominance hierarchy of HA to induce both potent receptor-blocking and broadly cross-reactive stem-directed antibody responses and are attractive candidates for a next-generation influenza vaccine that could replace current seasonal vaccines.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital Kharian Medical College, Pakistan, in September 2020. A total of 442 participants from three different strata (faculty, students, and administration/technical staff) were enrolled using a convenient sampling technique. A rapid antibody testing method was used to detect antibodies. The Ichroma&#8482; COVID-19 Ab test is an in vitro diagnostic device that helps in the rapid identification of COVID-19 by measuring the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the blood. An automated fluorescent immunoassay system (AFIAS-6), with a clinical sensitivity of 95.8% and specificity of 96.7%, was used for qualitative analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data, and data analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Results: In total, 442 participants were included in the study: 40 (9%) faculty members, 299 (67%) students, and 103 (23.3%) administrative/technical staff. As many as 14.9% of the participants were symptomatic; 32.4% always used masks, and 14% never wore masks. Furthermore, 69.7% of participants frequently washed their hands for 20 s, and 75.6% were aware of social distancing. A total of 16.96% of participants tested positive for IgG antibodies.

However, the long-term health effects of the 13(th) FYP air pollution control policies have not been evaluated, and the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought great uncertainty regarding the evaluation of the effects. In this study, we selected 329 cities in mainland China to study the chronic health effects due to the decrease in fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) during the 13(th) FYP.

Viral detection was done by the multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Demographics and clinical diagnosis were collected for previously healthy children tested positive for HCoVs. Results: Of the 9,589 samples tested, 1 or more respiratory viruses were detected from 5,017 (52.3%) samples and 463 (4.8%) samples were positive for HCoVs (OC43 2.8%, NL63 1.4%, 229E 0.7%). All 3 types co-circulated during winter months (November to February) with some variation by type. HCoV-OC43 was the most prevalent every winter season. HCoV-NL63 showed alternate peaks in late winter (January to March) and early winter (November to February). HCoV-229E had smaller peaks every other winter. Forty-one percent of HCoV-positive samples were co-detected with additional viruses;human rhinovirus 13.2%, respiratory syncytial virus 13.0%, influenza virus 4.3%.

Herein, we describe a 48 years old man presenting with rapidly progressive cognitive decline and hyponatremia diagnosed with anti LGI1 AE, occurring shortly after the second dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine and possibly representing a severe adverse event related to the vaccination. Response to high dose steroid therapy was favorable. As millions of people worldwide are currently receiving COVID-19 vaccinations, this case should serve to increase the awareness for possible rare autoimmune reactions following this novel vaccination in general, and particularly of anti-LGI1 AE.","output":"Case Report: Anti-LGI1 Encephalitis Following COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the review of 59 publications describing the aspects of etiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics, and treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.","output":"Novel coronavirus infection/ ӧѧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧѧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This comment discusses the contribution of population movement to the spread of COVID-19, with a reference to the spread of SARS 17 years ago.

Currently there are no treatment options for it. Drug repurposing studies explored the potency of antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, against SARS-CoV-2 virus. These drugs can inhibit the viral protease, called chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, also known as Main protease (3CL(pro)); hence, we studied the binding efficiencies of 4-aminoquinoline and 8-aminoquinoline analogs of chloroquine. Six compounds furnished better binding energies than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The interactions with the active site residues especially with Cys145 and His41, which are involved in catalytic diad for proteolysis, make these compounds potent main protease inhibitors. A regression model correlating binding energy and the molecular descriptors for chloroquine analogs was generated with R(2) = 0.9039 and Q(2) = 0.8848. This model was used to screen new analogs of primaquine and molecules from the Asinex compound library. The docking and regression analysis showed these analogs to be more potent inhibitors of 3CL(pro) than hydroxychloroquine and primaquine. The molecular dynamic simulations of the hits were carried out to determine the binding stabilities. Finally, we propose four compounds that show drug likeness toward SARS-CoV-2 that can be further validated through in vitro and in vivo studies.","output":"Theoretical Insights into the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activity of Chloroquine and Its Analogs and In Silico Screening of Main Protease Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Health policies in transitioning health systems are rarely informed by the economic burden of disease due to scanty access to data. This study aimed to estimate direct and indirect costs for first-ever acute ischemic stroke (AIS) during the first year for patients residing in Cluj, Romania, and hospitalized in 2019 at the County Emergency Hospital (CEH). Methods: The study was conducted using a mixed, retrospective costing methodology from a societal perspective to measure the cost of first-ever AIS in the first year after onset. Patient pathways for AIS were reconstructed to aid in mapping inpatient and outpatient cost items. We used anonymized administrative and clinical data at the hospital level and publicly available databases. Results: The average cost per patient in the first year after stroke onset was RON 25,297.83 (EUR 5226.82), out of which 80.87% were direct costs. The total cost in Cluj, Romania in 2019 was RON 17,455,502.7 (EUR 3,606,505.8). Conclusions: Our costing exercise uncovered shortcomings of stroke management in Romania, particularly related to acute care and neurorehabilitation service provision. Romania spends significantly less on healthcare than other countries (5.5% of GDP vs. 9.8% European Union average), exposing stroke survivors to a disproportionately high risk for preventable and treatable post-stroke disability.","output":"Societal Cost of Ischemic Stroke in Romania: Results from a Retrospective County-Level Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cocaine is one of the most consumed stimulants throughout the world, as official sources report. It is a naturally occurring sympathomimetic tropane alkaloid derived from the leaves of Erythroxylon coca, which has been used by South American locals for millennia. Cocaine can usually be found in two forms, cocaine hydrochloride, a white powder, or crack cocaine, the free base. While the first is commonly administered by insufflation (snorting) or intravenously, the second is adapted for inhalation (smoking). Cocaine can exert local anaesthetic action by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thus halting electrical impulse propagation; cocaine also impacts neurotransmission by hindering monoamine reuptake, particularly dopamine, from the synaptic cleft. The excess of available dopamine for postsynaptic activation mediates the pleasurable effects reported by users and contributes to the addictive potential and toxic effects of the drug. Cocaine is metabolised (mostly hepatically) into two main metabolites, ecgonine methyl ester and benzoylecgonine. Other metabolites include, for example, norcocaine and cocaethylene, both displaying pharmacological action, and the last one constituting a biomarker for co-consumption of cocaine with alcohol. This review provides a brief overview of cocaines prevalence and patterns of use, its physical-chemical properties and methods for analysis, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and multi-level toxicity.","output":"Cocaine: An Updated Overview on Chemistry, Detection, Biokinetics, and Pharmacotoxicological Aspects including Abuse Pattern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Messenger RNA-based medicines hold immense potential, as evidenced by their rapid deployment as COVID-19 vaccines. However, worldwide distribution of mRNA molecules has been limited by their thermostability, which is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic instability of RNA molecules to a chemical degradation reaction called in-line hydrolysis. Predicting the degradation of an RNA molecule is a key task in designing more stable RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we describe a crowdsourced machine learning competition (\\"Stanford OpenVaccine\\") on Kaggle, involving single-nucleotide resolution measurements on 6043 102-130-nucleotide diverse RNA constructs that were themselves solicited through crowdsourcing on the RNA design platform Eterna. The entire experiment was completed in less than 6 months, and 41% of nucleotide-level predictions from the winning model were within experimental error of the ground truth measurement. Furthermore, these models generalized to blindly predicting orthogonal degradation data on much longer mRNA molecules (504-1588 nucleotides) with improved accuracy compared to previously published models. Top teams integrated natural language processing architectures and data augmentation techniques with predictions from previous dynamic programming models for RNA secondary structure. These results indicate that such models are capable of representing in-line hydrolysis with excellent accuracy, supporting their use for designing stabilized messenger RNAs.

To assess the hypothesized link between depression and diffuse depression of gamma oscillations, we employed gamma phase-dependent closed loop neuromodulation of cortical areas, paced by the native OB output.

This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2-3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.","output":"A quantitative model used to compare within-host SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV dynamics provides insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the evolution of COVID-19 disease, the emergence of more complications associated with COVID-19 is taking place.

Prediction rules often have reasonable ability to either rule-in or rule-out disease (or another event), but rarely both. When a prediction model is intended to be used as a prediction rule, conveying its performance using the C-statistic, the most commonly reported model performance measure, does not provide information on the magnitude of the trade-offs. Yet, it is important that these trade-offs are clear, for example, to health professionals who might implement the prediction rule. This can be viewed as a form of knowledge translation. When communicating information on trade-offs to patients and the public there is a large body of evidence that indicates natural frequencies are most easily understood, and one particularly well-received way of depicting the natural frequency information is to use population diagrams. There is also evidence that health professionals benefit from information presented in this way. Here we illustrate how the implications of the trade-offs associated with prediction rules can be more readily appreciated when using natural frequencies. We recommend that the reporting of the performance of prediction rules should (1) present information using natural frequencies across a range of cut-points to inform the choice of plausible cut-points and (2) when the prediction rule is recommended for clinical use at a particular cut-point the implications of the trade-offs are communicated using population diagrams.

As the disease has numerous symptoms ranging from a simple fever to the inability to breathe, which may lead to death. One of these symptoms is a cough which is considered one of the most common symptoms for COVID-19 disease. Recent research shows that the cough of a COVID-19 patient has distinct features that are different from other diseases. Consequently, the cough sound can be detected and classified to be used as a preliminary diagnosis of the COVID-19, which will help in reducing the spreading of that disease. The artificial intelligence (AI) engine can diagnose COVID-19 diseases by executing differential analysis of its inherent characteristics and comparing it to other non-COVID-19 coughs. However, the diagnosis of a COVID-19 infection by cough alone is an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid framework for efficiently COVID-19 detection and diagnosis using various ML algorithms from cough audio signals. The accuracy of this framework is improved with the utilization of the genetic algorithm with the ML techniques. We also assess the proposed system called CR19 for diagnosis on metrics such as precision, recall, F-measure. The results proved that the hybrid (GA-ML) technique provides superior results based on different evaluation metrics compared with ML approaches such as LR, LDA, KNN, CART, NB, and SVM.

We hypothesized that formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a purported mechanism of microbial trapping, exacerbates acute neurological injury after TBI. NET formation coincided with cerebral hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia after experimental TBI, while elevated circulating NETs correlated with reduced serum deoxyribonuclease-1 (DNase-I) activity in patients with TBI. Functionally, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the downstream kinase peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) mediated NET formation and cerebrovascular dysfunction after TBI.

We wished to determine whether SeCA125 could also be a marker of volume status in PD patients. METHODS: We contemporaneously measured SeCA125, serum N terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) and ECW by bioimpedance in adult PD patients attending for outpatient assessment of peritoneal membrane function. RESULTS: The median SeCA125 was 19 (12C33) U/mL in 489 PD patients, 61.3% male, median age 61.5 (interquartile range 50C75) years. SeCA125 was positively associated with the ratio of ECW/total body water (TBW) (r = 0.29, p < 0.001), 4-h peritoneal dialysate to serum creatinine ratio (r = 0.23, p < 0.001), NTproBNP) (r = 0.18, p < 0.001), and age (r = 00.17, p = 0.001) and negatively with 24-h PD ultrafiltration volume (r = ?0.28, p < 0.001) serum albumin (r = ?0.22, p < 0.001), and echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (r = ?0.20, p < 0.001), but not with residual renal function or C-reactive protein.

We used single-molecule real-time sequencing with tangential flow filtration for fermented cabbages after pre-filtration and transmission electron microscopy to confirm the identity of ultramicrobacteria (UMB).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the differences between ultramicrobial communities and microbial communities of fermented cabbages. Although the size of the ultramicrobial communities was smaller than that of the latter, their diversity was not lower. In addition, some UMB underwent cell shrinkage due to unfavorable environments, while others maintained their small size regardless. Major pathogens were not detected in the ultramicrobial communities of fermented cabbages. Nevertheless, several suspicious strains were detected. Our method can be used to screen food materials for the presence of UMB undetectable via conventional methods. Ultramicrobial and microbial communities were efficiently separated using tangential flow filtration and analyzed via single-molecule real-time sequencing. The ultramicrobial communities of fermented vegetables were different from conventional microbial communities. This study provides new insights into the ecology of UMB in foods.","output":"Ultramicrobacteria in various fermented cabbages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared Covid 19 to be a pandemic that poses a threat to humanity.

The idea is to recommend answerers, who are credited the highest expertise under question tags at routing time. The expertise of answerers under already replied question tags is intuitively discounted by accounting for the observed tags, votes and temporal information of their answers. Instead, the discounted expertise under not yet replied tags is predicted via a latent-factor representation of both answerers and tags. These representations are inferred by means of Gibbs sampling under a new Bayesian probabilistic model of discounted user expertise and asking-answering behavior. The devised model unprecedentedly explains the latter two CQA aspects as the result of a generative process, that seamlessly integrates probabilistic matrix factorization and network behavior characterization. An extensive comparative experimentation over real-world CQA data demonstrates that our approach outperforms several-state-of-the-art competitors in recommendation effectiveness.","output":"Collaborative Recommendation of Temporally-Discounted Tag-Based Expertise for Community Question Answering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate safety and efficacy of a novel technique for cervical stabilization. STUDY DESIGN In vivo experimental. ANIMALS Four normal adult quarterhorse crossbreed horses (2-4 years of age, > 250 kg). METHODS One mid-cervical spinal unit (C3-C4) was distracted with a porous metal interbody fusion device (IFD) and stabilized with a polyaxial pedicle screw and rod construct. Neurologic examinations were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Radiographs of the fusion site and adjoining vertebrae were obtained preoperatively and monthly. Horses were euthanized at 8 months and spinal units were evaluated for osseointegration and implant safety via micro-computed tomography (CT), histology, and histomorphometry. RESULTS The procedure was performed safely in all horses, without severe postoperative complications. Evaluation of radiographs revealed no implant failure, implant migration, or spinal unit instability in any of the horses. The presence of new bone formation around the screw and rod constructs was confirmed via micro-CT. No evidence of inflammation or iatrogenic damage was noted from histology. New bone was present within the IFD in all horses, with variable osseointegration on the cranial and caudal surfaces of the implant in 3 horses. CONCLUSION The novel technique reported in the present study was safely applied to stabilize the C3-C4 spinal unit in the horses tested here and led to variable osseointegration within 8 months.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether PEAR-004, a smartphone-based investigational digital therapeutic, improves the symptoms of an acute psychotic exacerbation of schizophrenia when it is added to standard treatments. METHODS: This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, rater-blinded, parallel group proof?of?concept study of 112 participants with moderate acute psychotic exacerbation in schizophrenia. This study was conducted in 6 clinical trial research sites in the United States from December 2018 to September 2019. The primary outcome, change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to week 12 or the last available visit, was analyzed using the mixed-effects regression model for repeated measures, applied to an intent-to-treat sample. RESULTS: The total PANSS scores slightly decreased from baseline over the study period in both groups; the treatment difference at day 85 between PEAR-004 and sham was 2.7 points, in favor of the sham (2-sided P=.09). The secondary scales found no benefit, except for transient improvement in depressive symptoms with PEAR-004. Application engagement was good, and patient and clinical investigator satisfaction was high. No safety concerns were observed. There was some evidence of study site heterogeneity for the onboarding processes and directions on PEAR-004 product use at baseline and throughout the study. However, these differences did not affect the efficacy results.

Increasing reports on deaths, cases of new infection, and socioeconomic losses are continuously coming from all parts of the world. Developing an efficacious drug and/or vaccine is currently the major goal to the scientific communities. In this context, toll-like receptors (TLRs) could be the useful targets in adopting effective therapeutic approaches. METHODS: This chapter has been written by incorporating the findings on TLR-based therapies against SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated in the recently published research papers/reviews. RESULTS: TLRs are the essential components of host immunity and play critical roles in deciding the fate of SARS-CoV-2 by influencing the immunoregulatory circuits governing human immune response to this pathogen. Hitherto, a number of multi-subunit peptide-based vaccines and pharmacological agents developed against SARS-CoV-2 have been found to manipulate TLR function. Therefore, circumventing overt immunopathology of COVID-19 applying TLR-antagonists can effectively reduce the morality caused from \\"cytokine storm\\"-induced multiorgan failure. Similarly, pre-administration of TLR- agonists may be used as a prophylaxis to sensitize the immune system of the individuals having risk of infection. A lot of collaborative efforts are required for bench-to-bench transformation of these knowledges. CONCLUSION: This chapter enlightens the potentials and promises of TLR-guided therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 by reviewing the major findings and achievements depicted in the literatures published till date.","output":"Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) as Therapeutic Targets for Treating SARS-CoV-2: An Immunobiological Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Perinatal mental disorders are a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and postpartum, and are highly treatable when identified early. However, many women, especially in low and middle-income countries, lack access to routine identification and treatment of mental illness in public health settings. The prevalence of perinatal depression and anxiety disorders, common mental disorders, is three times higher for South African women relative to women in high-income countries. The public health system has begun to integrate mental health into maternal care, making South Africa a relevant case study of perinatal mental healthcare. Yet studies are few. We sought to investigate healthcare providers perceptions of the barriers to early identification and screening of common perinatal mental disorders in public health facilities in South Africa. METHODS: Employing qualitative methods, we used purposive sampling to identify study participants, supplemented by snowball sampling. From September 2019CJune 2020, we conducted in-depth interviews with 24 key informants in South Africa. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used a thematic approach to generate initial analytical themes and then conducted iterative coding to refine them. We adapted a delivery systems framework to organise the findings, depicted in a conceptual map. RESULTS: Reported barriers to early identification and treatment of mental illness in the perinatal period encompassed four levels: (1) structural factors related to policies, systems and resources; (2) socio-cultural factors, including language and cultural barriers; (3) organisational factors, such as lack of provider preparation and training and overburdened clinics; and (4) individual patient and healthcare provider factors. CONCLUSION: Barriers act across multiple levels to reduce quality mental health promotion and care, thereby creating an environment where inequitable access to identification of mental disorders and quality mental health services was embedded into systems and everyday practice. Integrated interventions across multiple levels are essential to improve the early identification and treatment of mental illness in perinatal women in South Africa. We provide recommendations derived from our findings to overcome barriers at each of the four identified levels.

The effect of these initiatives on surgical provision is unknown. The primary objective was to determine the effect of public health policies and surgical society guidelines implemented during the pandemic on elective and emergency caseload of surgical specialities operating within South East Queensland. METHODS: This observational study utilized non re-identifiable electronic data to quantify the caseload of surgical specialities across five secondary and tertiary referral hospitals in South East Queensland prior to and during the implementation of such initiatives. All patients undergoing a surgical procedure between 1 March and 24 April 2019 and the same period in 2020 were included. Participants' demographic and clinical information, such as age, the American Society of Anesthesiologists score, surgical date and location, surgical subspecialty and procedure name, was included. RESULTS: During the 2020 time period, there were 2991 elective cases compared to 4422 surgeries occurring in the same period in 2019 (32.4% reduction). Meanwhile, 2082 emergency surgeries were performed in the 2020 period compared to 2362 in 2019 (12.0% decrease). Ophthalmology and dental/ear, nose and throat/maxillofacial surgery experienced the largest reduction in elective surgeries, whereas emergency caseload increased for vascular and cardiothoracic services, and only slightly decreased for plastics and urology. CONCLUSION: The public health initiatives and guidance implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced surgical specialties' elective caseload.

This study aims to investigate air pollutant mass concentration changes during the lockdown in Shanghai. Air pollutant mass concentration data and meteorological data during the pre-lockdown period and the level I response lockdown period were analyzed by statistical analysis and a Lagrangian particle diffusion model. The data was classified in three periods: P1 (pre-lockdown: 10 days before the Spring Festival), P2 (the first 10 days after lockdown: during the Spring Festival celebration), and P3 (the second 10 days after lockdown: after the Spring Festival). Data for the same period in 2019 were used as a reference. The results indicate that the Spring Festival holiday in 2019 resulted in a reduction in energy consumption, which led to a decrease in PM2.5 (26.4%) and NO2 (43.41%) mass concentration, but an increase in ozone mass concentration (31.39%) in P2 compared with P1. The integrated effect of the Spring Festival holiday and lockdown in 2020 resulted in a decrease in PM2.5 (36.5%) and NO2 (51.9%) mass concentrations, but an increase in ozone mass concentration (43.8%) in P2 compared with P1. After the Spring Festival, the mass concentrations of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 increased by 74.41%, 5.52%, and 53.28%, respectively in P3 compared with P2 in 2019.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. OBSERVATIONS: Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T cells are important in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This may be facilitated via anti-viral antibody responses that may prevent re-infection. However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm and vascular pathology appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS. IMPLICATIONS: In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19. In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection. However, adjustments to dosing schedules may help de-risk the chance of infection further and reduce the concerns of people with MS being treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The underpinning biology relating to multiple sclerosis disease modifying treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two hundred and twenty Escherichia coli isolates from 314 Mediterranean water buffalo calves less than 4 weeks old affected by severe diarrhoea with a lethal outcome were characterized for the presence of the virulence factors LT, ST, Stx1, Stx2, haemolysins, intimin, CNF1, CNF2, CDT-I, CDT-II, CDT-III, CDT-IV, and F17-related fimbriae (F17a, F17b, F17c, F17d).

Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment. Examining transcriptional factor activation and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, SARS-CoV-2 in the context of type I IFN induces phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased ISG proteins. In contrast, the original SARS-CoV has no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation or ISG protein increases even in the presence of type I IFN pretreatment. Next, we examined IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells finding SARS-CoV-2 had reduced viral replication relative to SARS-CoV and induced STAT1 phosphorylation late during infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the IFN-I response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dermatosurgery is a growing subspeciality due to increasing numbers of skin cancer and aesthetic procedures.

We explored the potential presence and impact of selection in such studies using data from self-report questionnaires and national registries. MethodsUsing pre-pandemic data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (mean age=27.6 (standard deviation [SD]=0.5); 49% female) and UK Biobank (UKB) (mean age=56 (SD=8.1); 55% female) with data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and death-with-COVID-19 (UKB only), we investigated predictors of selection into COVID-19 analytic subsamples. We then conducted empirical analyses and simulations to explore the potential presence, direction, and magnitude of bias due to selection when estimating the association of body mass index (BMI) with SARS-CoV-2 infection and death-with-COVID-19. ResultsIn both ALSPAC and UKB a broad range of characteristics related to selection, sometimes in opposite directions. For example, more educated participants were more likely to have data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in ALSPAC, but less likely in UKB. We found bias in many simulated scenarios. For example, in one scenario based on UKB, we observed an expected odds ratio of 2.56 compared to a simulated true odds ratio of 3, per standard deviation higher BMI. ConclusionAnalyses using COVID-19 self-reported or national registry data may be biased due to selection. The magnitude and direction of this bias depends on the outcome definition, the true effect of the risk factor, and the assumed selection mechanism.

Justice is clearly at stake, but it is unclear what justice requires in the international distribution of a scarce vaccine during a pandemic. Many are condemning vaccine nationalism as an obstacle to equitable global distribution. We argue that limited national partiality in allocating vaccines will be a component of justice rather than an obstacle to it. For there are role-based and community-embedded responsibilities to take care of ones own, which constitute legitimate moral reasons for some identity-related prioritisation. Furthermore, a good form of vaccine nationalism prioritises ones own without denying or ignoring duties derived from a principle of equal worth, according to which all persons, regardless of citizenship or identity, equally deserve vaccine-induced protection from COVID-19. Rather than dismissing nationalism as a tragic obstacle, it is necessary to acknowledge that a limited form of it is valuable and expresses moral commitments. Only then can one understand our world of competing obligations, a world where cosmopolitan duties of benevolence sometimes conflict with special obligations of community membership. Once these competing obligations are recognised as such, we can begin the work of designing sound ethical frameworks for achieving justice in the global distribution of a coronavirus vaccine and developing practical strategies for avoiding, mitigating or resolving conflicts of duty.","output":"Love thy neighbour?

METHODS The ABO blood type of 9 pedigree members were determined by serological methods. Exons 6 and 7 of the ABO gene were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. The patient and her father were also subjected to clone sequencing analysis. RESULTS Serological tests demonstrated that the proband and her younger brother had an ABw subtype, whilst her father and two daughters had Bw subtype. Clone sequencing found that the exon 7 of the ABO gene of the proband had a T>C substitution at position 695, which was identified as a BW.11 allele compared with the reference sequence B.01. This BW.11 allele was also identified in the proband's father, brother and two daughters. Due to allelic competition, the A/BW.11 and BW.11/O alleles demonstrated significantly different phenotypes. CONCLUSION The c.695T>C substitution of the ABO gene may lead to allelic competition in the Bw11 subtype.

Whether active oncologic treatment is an additional risk factor in this population remains unclear. Therefore, here we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence for the effect of active oncologic treatment on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Systematic search of databases (PubMed, Embase) was conducted for studies published from inception to July 1, 2020, with a subsequent search update conducted on 10 October 2020. In addition, abstracts and presentations from major conference proceedings (ASCO, ESMO, AACR) as well as pre-print databases (medxriv, bioxriv) were searched. Retrospective and prospective studies reporting clinical outcomes in cancer patients with laboratory confirmation or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and details of active or recent oncologic treatment were selected. Random-effects model was applied throughout meta-analyses. Summary outcome measure was the pooled odds ratio (OR) of death for active cancer therapy versus no active cancer therapy for each of the following modalities: recent surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy. RESULTS: Sixteen retrospective and prospective studies (3558 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Active chemotherapy was associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.60, 95% CI, 1.14-2.23). No significant association with risk of death was identified for active targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or recent surgery. Meta-analysis of multivariate adjusted OR of death for active chemotherapy was consistently associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.42, 95% CI, 1.01-2.01).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women compared with: (1) nonpregnant controls and (2) natural coronavirus disease 2019 infection in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 nonpregnant women) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at 2 academic medical centers. Titers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike and receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin M were quantified in participant sera (n=131) and breastmilk (n=31) at baseline, at the second vaccine dose, at 2 to 6 weeks after the second vaccine, and at delivery by Luminex. Umbilical cord sera (n=10) titers were assessed at delivery. Titers were compared with those of pregnant women 4 to 12 weeks from the natural infection (n=37) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A pseudovirus neutralization assay was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titers for the subset of women who delivered during the study period. Postvaccination symptoms were assessed via questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed-effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences among groups. RESULTS: Vaccine-induced antibody titers were equivalent in pregnant and lactating compared with nonpregnant women (pregnant, median, 5.59; interquartile range, 4.68-5.89; lactating, median, 5.74; interquartile range, 5.06-6.22; nonpregnant, median, 5.62; interquartile range, 4.77-5.98, P=.24). All titers were significantly higher than those induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy (P<.0001). Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in umbilical cord than maternal sera, although this finding did not achieve statistical significance (maternal sera, median, 104.7; interquartile range, 61.2-188.2; cord sera, median, 52.3; interquartile range, 11.7-69.6; P=.05). The second vaccine dose (boost dose) increased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific immunoglobulin G, but not immunoglobulin A, in maternal blood and breastmilk. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in nonpregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were statistically significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placenta and breastmilk.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine response in pregnant and lactating women: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background While masks are recommended for those with asthma in the era of COVID-19, there is limited research exploring the extent of and problems related to mask use in adults with asthma. Objective We sought to describe in adults with asthma: 1) the extent masks are worn and attitudes and beliefs about wearing masks; (2) participant characteristics associated with problems experienced while wearing a mask, and (3) participant experiences and recommendations regarding masks. Methods The Mask Use in Adults with Asthma online survey was conducted with 501 adults with asthma primarily (96.6%) from the United States. A Mask Effects Scale (MES) was compiled from items addressing problems experienced wearing a mask with higher total scores indicating more problems. Open-ended questions explored factors considered when choosing a mask, problems experienced while wearing a mask, and recommendations to others with asthma. Survey data were analyzed descriptively and via multiple regression. Themes were generated from open-ended items. Results Almost all participants (98.4%) indicated wearing a mask in public and most (67.4%) wore a mask 3 hours per day. Poorer asthma control and wearing a mask longer were significantly associated with higher MES scores (P.001 & .005, respectively). Participant recommendations included Just wear it, use a comfortable, well-fitting mask, take mask breaks, and carry your inhaler.

In comparison, assessments of the implications for water quality are relatively rare. As the first country impacted by COVID-19, China implemented local and national lockdowns that shut down industries and businesses between January and May 2020. Based on monthly field measurements (N = 1693) and daily automonitoring (N = 65), this study analyzed the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on river water quality in China. The results showed significant improvements in river water quality during the lockdown period but out-of-step improvements for different indicators. Reductions in ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) began relatively soon after the lockdown; chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) showed improvements beginning in late January/early February and mid-March, respectively, while increases in pH were more temporally concentrated in the period from mid-March to early May. Compared to April 2019, the Water Quality Index increased at 67.4% of the stations in April 2020, with 75.9% of increases being significant. Changes in water quality parameters also varied spatially for different sites and were mainly determined by the locations and levels of economic development. After the lifting of the lockdown in June, all water quality parameters returned to pre-COVID-19 lockdown conditions. Our results clearly demonstrate the impacts of human activities on water quality and the potential for reversing ecosystem degradation by better management of wastewater discharges to replicate the beneficial impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown.

A limited number of studies have evaluated the association of liver enzymes with both general and abdominal obesity in the general population; data for the Bangladeshi population are not available yet. This study aimed to assess the relationship of serum liver enzymes activity with both general and abdominal obesity in Bangladeshi adults. In total, 540 blood samples were obtained from the participants (388 males and 152 females) and analyzed for serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP using standard methods. General obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI)  27.5 kg/m(2) and abdominal obesity was defined as waist circumference (WC)  90 cm in males and  80 cm in females. The relationship between liver enzymes and obesity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression models. Overall, 58% of participants in the general obesity group and 55% of the participants in the abdominal obesity group had at least one or more elevated levels of liver enzymes. The prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was significantly higher in the obesity group compared to the normal BMI and WC groups (p < 0.05 for all cases). The mean level of serum ALT, AST and GGT were significantly higher in the obesity group than the normal BMI group (p < 0.05). In the WC groups, mean AST and GGT were significantly higher in the obesity group compared to the normal group (p < 0.05). In regression analysis, serum levels of ALT showed an independent and significant association with general obesity, whereas, serum GGT showed a significant association with both general and abdominal obesity. In conclusion, a high prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was observed among participants included in the present study. Of the four enzymes, serum GGT was independently associated with both general and abdominal obesity.

Rutin, a medicinally important flavonoid belongs to one of the best natural antioxidant classes. It has antiprotozoal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Keeping the antimicrobial potential of rutin in mind, we studied its role in the inhibition of essential proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), papain-like protease (PLpro), and spike (S)-protein through different in silico approaches. Experimental procedure: Molecular docking, inhibition constant, hydrogen bond calculations, and ADMET-properties prediction were performed using different softwares. Results and conclusion: Molecular docking study showed significant binding of rutin with Mpro, RdRp, PLpro, and S-proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Out of these four proteins, Mpro exhibited the strongest binding affinity with the least binding energy (-8.9 kcal/mol) and stabilized through hydrogen bonds with bond lengths ranging from 1.18 ? to 3.17 ? as well as hydrophobic interactions. The predicted ADMET and bioactivity showed its optimal solubility, non-toxic, and non-carcinogenic properties. The values of the predicted inhibitory constant of the rutin with SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins ranged between 5.66 M and 6.54 M which suggested its promising drug candidature.

METHODS ERCPs performed by 6 providers at a single institution from 2006 to 2014 were identified. Quality measures were defined using society guidelines and from expert opinion, and then extracted using a combination of NLP and data mining (eg, ICD9-CM codes). Validation for each quality measure was performed by manual record review. Quality measures were grouped into preprocedure (5), intraprocedure (6), and postprocedure (2). NLP was evaluated using measures of precision and accuracy. RESULTS A total of 23,674 ERCPs were analyzed (average patient age, 52.9  17.8 years, 14,113 were women [59.6%]). Among 13 quality measures, precision of NLP ranged from 84% to 100% with intraprocedure measures having lower precision (84% for precut sphincterotomy). Accuracy of NLP ranged from 90% to 100% with intraprocedure measures having lower accuracy (90% for pancreatic stent placement).

Method: The study design was analytical cross sectional. An online questionnaire was filled by 1033 respondents between 16th and 22nd April 2021. Adults who had received both doses of Sinopharm COVID19 vaccine more than a week ago or only a single dose with serious side effect were included in the study. The frequency and severity of vaccination related side effects were assessed and breakthrough infection identified. Results: The mean age of participants was 36.7 12.91(18 to 92) years. Ninety one percent of participants (n=946) were health care professionals. One fifth (n=225/1033, 21.8%) had suffered from COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination, confirmed using the nasal RT-PCR test. None of the participants reported serious (grade III) or life threatening (grade IV) adverse reactions after either of the two doses. The most common side effects after the first dose were pain at injection site (20.3%), fatigue (20.3%), headache (13.9%), myalgia (12.5%) and fever (9.3%) whereas after the second dose were fatigue (16.8%), pain at injection site (15.8%), myalgia (14%) and fever (6.7%). The side effects were more common in participants who had previous history of COVID-19 infection. Of 225 previously infected participants, 97(43.1%) (p value=0.020) and 90 (40%) (p value=0.001) participants had side effects after 1st and 2nd dose respectively. 16 participants (1.55%) developed PCR positive COVID-19 infection two weeks after the second dose while 3(0.29%) participants had a re-infection.

There were tremendous efforts endeavoured globally by scientists to combat these viral diseases and now for SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir and dexamethasone are adopted for use against COVID-19 and currently clinical studies are underway to test their safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19 patients.

In this context, the present study employed an in silico approach to assess the inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals obtained from GC-MS analysis of twelve Clerodendrum species against the imperative spike protein, main protease enzyme Mpro and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. An extensive molecular docking investigation of the phytocompounds at the active binding pockets of the viral proteins revealed promising inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals taraxerol, friedelin and stigmasterol. Decent physicochemical attributes of the compounds in accordance with Lipinski's rule of five and Veber's rule further established them as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding free energy estimation revealed that taraxerol was the most promising candidate displaying the highest binding efficacy with all the concerned SARS-CoV-2 proteins included in the present analysis. Our observations were supported by robust molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes of the viral proteins with taraxerol for a timescale of 40 nanoseconds. It was striking to note that taraxerol exhibited better binding energy scores with the concerned viral proteins than the drugs that are specifically targeted against them.

For many whose distant ancestors moved to temperate climes, these adaptations proved harmful: pigmentation decreased by natural selection and susceptibility to hypertension emerged. Now an added risk is lung inflammation from coronavirus that may be furthered by innate immune differences. Hypertension and coronavirus have in common angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which decreases blood pressure and mediates virus entry. In keeping with less detailed studies, a long-term case-report shows that decreased blood pressure induced by blocking a primary angiotensin receptor is supplemented, above critical blocker dosage, by a further temperature-dependent fall, likely mediated by ACE2 and secondary angiotensin receptors. Temperature-dependence suggests a linkage with tropical heritage and an influence of blockers on the progress of coronavirus infections. Positive therapeutic results should result from negation of host pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the primary angiotensin receptor and concomitant promotion of countervailing anti-inflammatory effects mediated by ACE2 through other receptors. These effects may involve innate immune system components (lectin complement pathway, NAD metabolome).

Three participants had no remarkable history of visual dysfunction or acquired brain injury; two participants had prior neurological history: one with mild traumatic brain injury and one with concussion, both are significant for visual dysfunction following the acute events. Interventions All patients were treated in acute and outpatient rehabilitation settings following the positive visual screen. Main Outcome Measures N/A. Results This case series highlights visual dysfunction in five patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with and without prior history of neurological disorders. All five participants described newly acquired or a recrudescence of visual symptoms which impacted daily function. 5 out of 5 patients had confirmatory findings following comprehensive visual assessment. Visual symptoms consistent between the cases included, but were not limited to, blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia, impaired near-point focus, headaches, and general visual discomfort and asthenopia throughout their day. Conclusions Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 present with a wide-range of symptoms and often neurological sequelae, without a predictable pattern. Despite the substantial impact of COVID-19 globally, and the massive increase in research efforts, certain domains remain poorly understood. One such domain is vision and the impact that visual impairment attributed to COVID-19 has on functional independence. This case series supports new evidence for visual sequelae in COVID-19 with and without history of a neurological disorder. Such findings motivate new research questions such as the pathophysiological differences between acute onset versus recrudesced visual dysfunction.

METHODS: Electronic records of all patients presenting at EEDs of two tertiary-care Eye Centers during the COVID-19 national lockdown in Italy (March 10CMay 3, 2020) were compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Main outcomes were patient age, gender, and diagnoses. Statistical analysis included unpaired Student t-tests, Poisson regression, and chi-square test. RESULTS: Overall EED visits significantly decreased by 54.1% during the 2020 lockdown compared to 2019 (851 vs 1854, p < 0.001). During lockdown, patients showed comparable mean age (52.8 years in 2020 vs 53.3 years in 2019, p = 0.52) and significant male gender bias (61.1% in 2020 vs 55.8% in 2019, p < 0.0001). The most frequent pathologies were eye inflammations, trauma-related incidents, and spontaneous acute vitreous detachment. Patients with inflammation, headache/hemicrania, and spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhages were significantly less, whereas those with trauma-related diagnoses were significantly higher during the lockdown as compared with 2019 (p < 0.05).

The aim of this systematic review was to identify attributes of reproductive and maternal healthcare services in sub-Saharan Africa, and summarise the factors shaping women's preference to access these services. METHODS PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched from the inception of each database until March 2021 for published studies reporting stated preferences for maternal and reproductive healthcare services in sub-Saharan Africa. Data were extracted using a predefined extraction sheet, and the quality of reporting of included studies was assessed using PREFS and ISPOR (International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research) checklists. The Donabedian's model for quality of healthcare was used to categorise attributes into \\"structure\\", \\"process\\" and \\"outcome\\". RESULTS A total of 13 studies (12 discrete choice experiments and one best-worst scaling study) were included. Attributes related to the structure of healthcare services (e.g. availability of technical equipment, medications or diagnostic facilities, having good system conditions) are often included within the studies, and are considered the most important by women. Of the three dimensions of quality of healthcare, the outcome dimension was the least frequently studied across studies. All except one study explored women's preferences and the participants were pregnant women, women aged 18-49 years who had recently given birth and women living with human immunodeficiency virus. The included studies came from five sub-Saharan Africa countries of which Ethiopia and South Africa each contributed three studies. All of the included studies reported on the purpose, findings and significance of the study. However, none of the studies reported on the differences between responders vs non-responders. Nine of the 13 studies employed the ISPOR checklist and reported each item including the research question and the methods for identifying and selecting attributes, and provided the findings in sufficient detail and clarity.

METHODS: A total of 37 volunteers were fit tested in 20 selected FFRs in a randomized order. The selected FFRs were underwent quantitative fit testing by PortaCount? model 8038. To determine the effects of face sizes on respirator fit, the participants facial dimensions were measured using a digital caliper. RESULTS: The rate of passing fit tests for the studied FFRs were surprisingly low with 11 out of 20 FFRs having less than 10% passing fit tests and the best performers having only 43% and 27% passing fit tests (brands 2 and 20, respectively).

We report the clinical performance of T-Detect COVID, the first T-cell assay to identify prior SARS-CoV-2 infection using T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and repertoire profiling from whole blood samples. METHODS: The T-Detect COVID assay combines high-throughput immunosequencing of the TCR? gene from blood samples with a statistical classifier demonstrating 99.8% specificity for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The assay was employed in several retrospective and prospective cohorts to assess primary and secondary Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (N=205; N=77); primary and secondary Negative Percent Agreement (NPA; N=87; N=79); PPA compared to SARS-CoV-2 serology (N=55); and pathogen cross-reactivity (N=38). The real-world performance of the test was also evaluated in a retrospective review of test ordering (N=69) at a single primary care clinic in Park City, Utah. RESULTS: In validation studies, T-Detect COVID demonstrated high PPA (97.1% 15 days from diagnosis) in subjects with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; high NPA (~100%) in SARS-CoV-2 negative cases; equivalent or higher PPA with RT-PCR compared to two commercial EUA antibody tests; and no evidence of pathogen cross-reactivity. Review of assay use in a single clinic showed 100% PPA with RT-PCR in individuals with past confirmed SARS-CoV-2 vs. 85.7% for antibody testing, 100% agreement with positive antibody results, and positive results in 2/4 convalescent subjects with seroreversion to a negative antibody. In addition, 12/69 (17.3%) individuals with absent or negative RT-PCR tested positive by T-Detect COVID, nearly all of whom had compatible symptoms and/or exposure. TCR positivity was observed up to 12+ months (median 118 days) from the date of positive RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: A T-cell immunosequencing assay shows high clinical performance for identifying past SARS-CoV-2 infection from whole blood samples. This assay can provide additional insights on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response, with practical implications for clinical management, risk stratification, surveillance, assessing vaccine immunity, and understanding long-term sequelae.

Acute neuroinflammatory responses include activation of resident tissue macrophages in the CNS followed by release of a variety of cytokines and chemokines associated with activation of oxidative stress and delayed neuron damage. This makes the search for treatments with indirect anti-inflammatory properties relevant. From this point of view, attention is focused on further study of the treatment of patients with COVID-19 with dipyridamole (Curantil) which, having antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, can inhibit acute inflammatory activity and progression of fibrosis, is a drug with potential, especially among patients with early increases in the D-dimer concentration and severe signs of microangiopathy.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as a Predictor of Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration: Potential Treatment Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human infectious disease provoked by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, no specific vaccines or drugs against COVID-19 are available. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential in order to slow the virus spread and to contain the disease outbreak. Hence, new diagnostic tests and devices for virus detection in clinical samples that are faster, more accurate and reliable, easier and cost-efficient than existing ones are needed. Due to the small sizes, fast response time, label-free operation without the need for expensive and time-consuming labeling steps, the possibility of real-time and multiplexed measurements, robustness and portability (point-of-care and on-site testing), biosensors based on semiconductor field-effect devices (FEDs) are one of the most attractive platforms for an electrical detection of charged biomolecules and bioparticles by their intrinsic charge. In this review, recent advances and key developments in the field of label-free detection of viruses (including plant viruses) with various types of FEDs are presented. In recent years, however, certain plant viruses have also attracted additional interest for biosensor layouts: Their repetitive protein subunits arranged at nanometric spacing can be employed for coupling functional molecules. If used as adapters on sensor chip surfaces, they allow an efficient immobilization of analyte-specific recognition and detector elements such as antibodies and enzymes at highest surface densities. The display on plant viral bionanoparticles may also lead to long-time stabilization of sensor molecules upon repeated uses and has the potential to increase sensor performance substantially, compared to conventional layouts. This has been demonstrated in different proof-of-concept biosensor devices. Therefore, richly available plant viral particles, non-pathogenic for animals or humans, might gain novel importance if applied in receptor layers of FEDs. These perspectives are explained and discussed with regard to future detection strategies for COVID-19 and related viral diseases.","output":"Field-Effect Sensors for Virus Detection: From Ebola to SARS-CoV-2 and Plant Viral Enhancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents findings on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as reported by a representative sample of Oregon assisted living communities (AL) between December 2020 and March 2021.

The authors developed a miniaturized, label-free electrochemical impedimetric immunosensor for the sensitive and direct detection of arthritis Anti-CCP-ab biomarker. An interdigitated-chain-shaped microelectrode array (ICE) was fabricated by taking the advantage of microelectromechanical systems. The fabricated ICE was modified with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of Mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA) for immobilization of the synthetic peptide bio-receptor (B-CCP). The B-CCP was attached onto the surface of SAM modified ICE through a strong avidin-biotin bio-recognition system. The modified ICE surface with the SAM and bio-molecules (Avidin, B-CCP, Anti-CCP-ab and BSA) was morphologically and electrochemically characterized. The change in the sensor signal upon analyte binding on the electrode surface was probed through the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) property of charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the modified electrodes. EIS measurements were target specific and the sensor response was linearly increased with step wise increase in target analyte (Anti-CCP-ab) concentrations. The developed sensor showed a linear range for the addition of Anti-CCP-ab between 1 IU mL-1 a 800 IU mL-1 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and Human serum (HS), respectively. The sensor showed a limit of detection of 0.60 IU mL-1 and 0.82 IU mL-1 in the PBS and HS, respectively.

The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly advancing via global efforts. Hence, it is crucial for governments, public health officials, and policy makers to understand public attitudes and opinions towards vaccines, such that effective interventions and educational campaigns can be designed to promote vaccine acceptance. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate public opinion and perception on COVID-19 vaccines by investigating the spatiotemporal trends of their sentiment and emotion towards vaccines, as well as how such trends relate to popular topics on Twitter in the US. Methods: We collected over 300,000 geotagged tweets in the US from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of public sentiment and emotion over time at both national and state scales and identified three phases along the pandemic timeline with the significant changes of public sentiment and emotion. We further linked the changes to eleven key events and major topics as the potential drivers to induce such changes via cloud mapping of keywords and topic modeling. Results: An increasing trend of positive sentiment in parallel with the decrease of negative sentiment are generally observed in most states, reflecting the rising confidence and anticipation of the public towards COVID-19 vaccines. The overall tendency of the eight types of emotion implies the trustiness and anticipation of the public to vaccination, accompanied by the mixture of fear, sadness and anger. Critical social/international events and/or the announcements of political leaders and authorities may have potential impacts on the public opinion on vaccines. These factors, along with important topics and manual reading of popular posts on eleven key events, help identify underlying themes and validate insights from the analysis. Conclusions: The analyses of near real-time social media big data benefit public health authorities by enabling them to monitor public attitudes and opinions towards vaccine-related information in a geo-aware manner, address the concerns of vaccine skeptics and promote the confidence of individuals within a certain region or community, towards vaccines.","output":"Revealing public opinion towards COVID-19 vaccines using Twitter data in the United States: a spatiotemporal perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When Craig Dalton heard that his name came up at a nationally televised White House press briefing Monday, the medical epidemiologist at the University of Newcastle in Australia says I didnt believe it  Dalton did a quick websearch and his disbelief transformed into amazement Turned out, it was actually true, he told ScienceInsider Daltons unexpected moment in the media spotlight came as Deborah Birx, the White Houses coronavirus response coordinator, and Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stepped to the White House lectern to describe a new set of guidelines that the U S government would be distributing as part of its effort to slow the spread of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019) in the United States","output":"How an Australian researcher ended up in the spotlight at a White House coronavirus briefing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Public support plays a crucial in managing public health crises.

We fear that the Covid-19 pandemic, and the resultant social, financial, political, and medical disturbances, might influence outcomes. Hence, this study was conducted to establish causal relationships between Covid-19 Lockdown and induction outcomes in AML patients. Objective: To determine the rates of induction remission, induction failure, and induction mortalities in patients with AML treated during Covid-19 pandemic and compare the results during the Lockdown period with the Lock-lifted period in India. Design: This was a retrospective, observational study. Based on Covid-19 pandemic induced Lockdown period in India, patients were divided into two groups: Lockdown phase- induction therapy between 1st May and 31st August, 2020; and Lock-lifted phase- induction therapy between 1st Sept and 31st Dec, 2020. Setting: This study was conducted in Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati, a tertiary care cancer centre, unit of Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. Results: A total of 53 AML patients data were included in this study. Induction mortality was 45.16% in the 1st group, and 36.36% in the 2nd group (p 0.036). Partial remission rates were 40% and 29% in group 2 and 1 (p 0.086). Using survival analysis, death (event) after 2nd induction was 149.77 days (111.1-188.5) in group 1 & 137.23 (111.4-163.1) days in group 2, statistically insignificant. 2 patients died in group 1 due to Covid-19 related complications.

Objective To determine whether there are differences in the odds of household transmission by younger children compared with older children. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based cohort study took place between June 1 and December 31, 2020, in Ontario, Canada. Private households in which the index case individual of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was younger than 18 years were included. Individuals were excluded if they resided in apartments missing suite information, in households with multiple index cases, or in households where the age of the index case individual was missing. Exposures Age group of pediatric index cases categorized as 0 to 3, 4 to 8, 9 to 13, and 14 to 17 years. Main Outcomes and Measures Household transmission, defined as households where at least 1 secondary case occurred 1 to 14 days after the pediatric index case. Results A total of 6280 households had pediatric index cases, and 1717 households (27.3%) experienced secondary transmission. The mean (SD) age of pediatric index case individuals was 10.7 (5.1) years and 2863 (45.6%) were female individuals. Children aged 0 to 3 years had the highest odds of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to household contacts compared with children aged 14 to 17 years (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.17-1.75). This association was similarly observed in sensitivity analyses defining secondary cases as 2 to 14 days or 4 to 14 days after the index case and stratified analyses by presence of symptoms, association with a school/childcare outbreak, or school/childcare reopening. Children aged 4 to 8 years and 9 to 13 years also had increased odds of transmission (aged 4-8 years: odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.67; aged 9-13 years: odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.32). Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that younger children may be more likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with older children, and the highest odds of transmission was observed for children aged 0 to 3 years. Differential infectivity of pediatric age groups has implications for infection prevention within households, as well as schools/childcare, to minimize risk of household secondary transmission.

These prior health conditions are associated with vascular dysfunction, and the CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications include multiorgan failure and neurological problems. While the main route of entry into the body is inhalation, this virus has been found in many tissues, including the choroid plexus and meningeal vessels, and in neurons and CSF. MAIN BODY: We reviewed SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, ACE2 distribution and beneficial effects, the CNS vascular barriers, possible mechanisms by which the virus enters the brain, outlined prior health conditions (obesity, hypertension and diabetes), neurological COVID-19 manifestation and the aging cerebrovascualture. The overall aim is to provide the general reader with a breadth of information on this type of virus and the wide distribution of its main receptor so as to better understand the significance of neurological complications, uniqueness of the brain, and the pre-existing medical conditions that affect brain. The main issue is that there is no sound evidence for large flux of SARS-CoV-2 into brain, at present, compared to its invasion of the inhalation pathways. CONCLUSIONS: While SARS-CoV-2 is detected in brains from severely infected patients, it is unclear on how it gets there. There is no sound evidence of SARS-CoV-2 flux into brain to significantly contribute to the overall outcomes once the respiratory system is invaded by the virus. The consensus, based on the normal route of infection and presence of SARS-CoV-2 in severely infected patients, is that the olfactory mucosa is a possible route into brain. Studies are needed to demonstrate flux of SARS-CoV-2 into brain, and its replication in the parenchyma to demonstrate neuroinvasion. It is possible that the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are a consequence of mainly cardio-respiratory distress and multiorgan failure.

We and others previously demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that AR12 increases autophagosome formation and autophagic flux, enhances virus protein degradation, preventing virus reproduction, and prolonging the survival of infected animals. In this report, we determined whether AR12 could act against SARS-CoV-2. In a dose-dependent fashion AR12 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in transfected or infected cells. AR12 suppressed the production of infectious virions via autophagosome formation, which was also associated with degradation of GRP78. After AR12 exposure, the colocalization of GRP78 with spike protein was reduced. Knock down of eIF2&#945; prevented AR12-induced spike degradation and knock down of Beclin1 or ATG5 caused the spike protein to localize in LAMP2+ vesicles without apparent degradation.

VLPs take advantage of the well-defined molecular structures associated with sub-unit vaccines and the immunostimulatory nature of conjugate vaccines. AREAS COVERED In this review, we will discuss how advances in understanding the immune system can inform VLP-based vaccine design and how VLP-based vaccines have uncovered underlying mechanisms in the immune system.

Testing of proof-of-concept vaccines in the lab should seek to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of immune responses. The integration of these approaches will allow for VLP-based vaccines to live up to their promise as a powerful plug-and-play platform for next generation vaccine development.","output":"Mechanisms of cellular and humoral immunity through the lens of VLP-based vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic surgery for patients with portal hypertension is considered to be contraindicated because of the high risk of massive intraoperative hemorrhaging. However, recent reports have shown hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery for devascularization and splenectomy to be a safe and effective method of treating esophagogastric varices with portal hypertension. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hand-assisted laparoscopic devascularization and splenectomy (HALS Hassab's procedure) for the treatment of esophagogastric varices with portal hypertension. CASE PRESENTATION From 2009 to 2016, seven patients with esophagogastric varices with portal hypertension were treated with hand-assisted laparoscopic devascularization and splenectomy in our institute. Four men and three women with a median age of 61 years (range 35-71) were enrolled in this series. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for the perioperative variables, postoperative mortality and morbidity, and postoperative outcomes of esophagogastric varices. The median operative time was 455 (range 310-671) min. The median intraoperative blood loss was 695 (range 15-2395) ml. The median weight of removed spleen was 507 (range 242-1835) g. The conversion rate to open surgery was 0%. The median postoperative hospital stay was 21 (range 13-81) days. During a median 21 (range 3-43) months of follow-up, the mortality rate was 0%. Four postoperative complications (massive ascites, enteritis, intra-abdominal abscess, and intestinal ulcer) were observed in two patients. Those complications were treated successfully without re-operation. Esophagogastric varices in all patients disappeared or improved. Bleeding from esophagogastric varices was not observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Although our data are preliminary, hand-assisted laparoscopic devascularization and splenectomy proved an effective procedure for treating esophagogastric varices in patients with portal hypertension.","output":"Hand-assisted laparoscopic Hassab's procedure for esophagogastric varices with portal hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM To assess whether osteocytes have an effect on reflex myoelectrical activity during whole-body vibration (WBV) in postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants were classified into 2 groups: the low bone mineral density (BMD) group (n = 37) and normal BMD group (n = 43). Hip BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Surface electromyography data recorded from the adductor longus muscle were processed to obtain vibration-induced reflex myoelectrical activity. Changes in plasma sclerostin (SOST) levels with WBV were expressed as a standardized vibration-induced SOST index. RESULTS The standardized vibration-induced SOST index was 1.03  0.24 in the low BMD group and 0.99  0.33 in the normal BMD group. For plasma SOST levels, no group-by-time interaction was found. The resting myoelectrical activities of adductor muscles increased significantly during WBV in both groups. However, there was no significant difference in the main effects of WBV on resting myoelectrical activity between the groups. The standardized vibration-induced plasma SOST index was found to be a significant independent predictor of the standardized vibration-induced reflex myoelectrical activity of the adductor muscle in both groups. CONCLUSION This study suggests that osteocytes serve as mechanoreceptors of reflex electromyography during WBV.","output":"Effects of osteocytes on vibration-induced reflex muscle activity in postmenopausal women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of separation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive mother-newborn dyads on breastfeeding outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This observational longitudinal cohort study of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-and their infants at 3 NYU Langone Health hospitals was conducted between March 25, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Mothers were surveyed by telephone regarding predelivery feeding plans, in-hospital feeding, and home feeding of their neonates. Any change prompted an additional question to determine whether this change was due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Of the 160 mother-newborn dyads, 103 mothers were reached by telephone, and 85 consented to participate. There was no significant difference in the predelivery feeding plan between the separated and unseparated dyads (P = .268). Higher rates of breastfeeding were observed in the unseparated dyads compared with the separated dyads both in the hospital (P < .001) and at home (P = .012). Only 2 mothers in each group reported expressed breast milk as the hospital feeding source (5.6% of unseparated vs 4.1% of separated). COVID-19 was more commonly cited as the reason for change in the separated group (49.0% vs 16.7%; P < .001). When the dyads were further stratified by symptom status into 4 groups-asymptomatic separated, asymptomatic unseparated, symptomatic separated, and symptomatic unseparated-the results remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of COVID-19, separation of mother-newborn dyads impacts breastfeeding outcomes, with lower rates of breastfeeding both during hospitalization and at home following discharge compared with unseparated mothers and infants. No evidence of vertical transmission was observed; 1 case of postnatal transmission occurred from an unmasked symptomatic mother who held her infant at birth.","output":"Impact of Maternal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Detection on Breastfeeding Due to Infant Separation at Birth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In humans, coronaviruses can cause infections of the respiratory system, with damage of varying severity depending on the virus examined: ranging from mild or moderate upper respiratory tract diseases, such as the common cold, to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Human coronaviruses known to date, common throughout the world, are seven. The most common - and least harmful - ones were discovered in the 1960s and cause a common cold. Others, more dangerous, were identified in the early 2000s and cause more severe respiratory tract infections. Among these the SARS-CoV, isolated in 2003 and responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (the so-called SARS), which appeared in China in November 2002, the Coronavirus 2012 (2012-nCoV) cause of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome from Coronavirus (MERS), which exploded in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia, and actually SARS-CoV-2.

Our overall research question is: How has centredness been represented within the health literature published between 1990 and 2019? METHODS A scoping review across five databases (Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase (Ovid) and Scopus; August 2019) to identify all peer-reviewed literature published since 1990 that focused on the concept of centredness in any healthcare discipline or setting. Screening occurred in duplicate by a multidisciplinary, multinational team. The team met regularly to iteratively develop and refine a coding template that was used in analysis and discuss the interpretations of centredness reported in the literature. RESULTS A total of 23 006 title and abstracts, and 499 full-text articles were screened. A total of 159 articles were included in the review. Most articles were from the USA, and nursing was the disciplinary perspective most represented. We identified nine elements of centredness: Sharing power; Sharing responsibility; Therapeutic relationship/bond/alliance; Patient as a person; Biopsychosocial; Provider as a person; Co-ordinated care; Access; Continuity of care. There was little variation in the concept of centredness no matter the preceding word (eg, patient-/person-/client-), healthcare setting or disciplinary lens. Improving health outcomes was the most common justification for pursuing centredness as a concept, and respect was the predominant driving value of the research efforts. The patient perspective was rarely included in the papers (15% of papers). CONCLUSIONS Centredness is consistently conceptualised, regardless of the preceding word, disciplinary lens or nation of origin. Further research should focus on centring the patient perspective and prioritise research that considers more diverse cultural perspectives.","output":"Who is at the centre of what?

However, in the point-of-care (POC) setting, apical 2-chamber views are often difficult to obtain, limiting the usefulness of this approach. Since most POC physicians often rely on visual assessment of apical 4-chamber and parasternal long-axis views, our algorithm was adapted to use either one of these 3 views or any combination. This study aimed to (1) test the accuracy of these automated estimates; (2) determine whether they could be used to accurately classify LV function. METHODS Reference EF was obtained using conventional biplane measurements by experienced echocardiographers. In protocol 1, we used echocardiographic images from 166 clinical examinations. Both automated and reference EF values were used to categorize LV function as hyperdynamic (EF>73%), normal (53%-73%), mildly-to-moderately (30%-52%), or severely reduced (<30%). Additionally, LV function was visually estimated for each view by 10 experienced physicians. Accuracy of the detection of reduced LV function (EF<53%) by the automated classification and physicians' interpretation was assessed against the reference classification. In protocol 2, we tested the new machine-learning algorithm in the POC setting on images acquired by nurses using a portable imaging system. RESULTS Protocol 1: the agreement with the reference EF values was good (intraclass correlation, 0.86-0.95), with biases <2%. Machine-learning classification of LV function showed similar accuracy to that by physicians in most views, with only 10% to 15% cases where it was less accurate. Protocol 2: the agreement with the reference values was excellent (intraclass correlation=0.84) with a minimal bias of 2.56.4%. CONCLUSIONS The new machine-learning algorithm allows accurate automated evaluation of LV function from echocardiographic views commonly used in the POC setting. This approach will enable more POC personnel to accurately assess LV function.","output":"Deep Learning-Based Automated Echocardiographic Quantification of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: A Point-of-Care Solution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Critical Care Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The novel COVID-19 virus has been found to be associated in a wide variety of complications most commonly involving the lungs namely by pneumonia with resultant ARDS We present a case of COVID19 related extensive pulmonary emboli CASE PRESENTATION: A previously well 47-year-old male presented with an 8 day history of fever, cough & dyspnea He tested positive for COVID-19 as an outpatient Four days later, he developed left sided pleuritic chest pain & presented to hospital On examination, blood pressure was 119/89mmHg, HR 124beats/min & RR 44breaths/min Despite this, he was saturating 93% on room air On examination, he had diminished breath sounds and faint crackles bilaterally Significant laboratory investigations revealed, leucocytosis of 18 (4 00 -11 00 K/ul), troponin of 3 13 (0 00 - 0 03ng/ml), C-reactive protein was 236 (20 UG/ml FEU (0 00-0 04 ug/ml) and BNP of &lt; 5 (0-100pg/ml) Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with no ST segment changes Plain chest radiograph had subsegmental airspace disease in the left lower lobe CT pulmonary angiography revealed a saddle pulmonary embolus with filling defects throughout right upper middle and lower lobe and left upper and lower lobe pulmonary arteries, and evidence of right heart strain There were airspace opacities in the left and right lungs A transthoracic echocardiogram study confirmed right heart strain He underwent emergent catheter directed thrombolysis and was placed on heparin infusion Two days later, an IVC filter was placed He was discharged on day 7 with a six month course apixaban He received five days of hydroxychloroquine, thiamine, vitamin C and zinc He was also given 5 days of ceftriaxone At 2 month follow up, he continues to do well and no longer has any respiratory symptoms or further hypoxia DISCUSSION: COVID-19 causes excessive inflammation that can induce initiation and progression of both venous and arterial thromboembolism The exact pathophysiology is unknown but it is hypothesized that the virus induces the expression of tissue factor which is a major coagulation activator Therefore, pulmonary emboli (PE) should be a consideration in COVID-19 patients with acutely worsening respiratory symptoms Interestingly, it has been highlighted that those with a d-dimer of greater than 1ug/ml have an odds ratio increased by 18 times for mortality Despite this, our patient continues to do well on anticoagulation, presumably because of his age, health, as well as early intervention and anticoagulation Data from China indicate that those who received heparin had a 20% survival rate Apixaban maybe an acceptable long term therapy, but further study is needed CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that even though dyspnea and hypoxia are key presenting symptoms of COVID-19, one must be vigilant for acute worsening and consider other differentials such as pulmonary emboli Reference #1: Gronagle Dennis, ODonnell James S, Sharif Kassem, Emery Paul, Bridgewood Charles, Immune mechanism of pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy in COVID19 pneumonia, The Lancet Rheumatology, May 2020, https://doi org/10 1016/ S2665-9913(20)30121-1 Reference #2: Ning Tang Huan Bai Xing Chen Jiale Gong Dengju Li, Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy, Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis, March 2020, https://doi org/10 1111/jth 14817 Reference #3: Oudkerk Matthijs, Bller Harry R, Kuijpers Dirkjan, van Es Nick, Oudkerk Sytse F, McLoud Theresa C et al, RSNA Radiology, April 2020, ttps://doi org/10 1148/radiol 2020201629 DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Musaab Alfaki, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Nia Flemming, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Latoya Gayle, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Janeen Grant, source=Web Response No relevant elationships by Fausto Lisung, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Jason Lofters, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Gene Otuonye, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Ro-Kaye Simmonds, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Rani Sittol, source=Web Response","output":"Saddle Up!

However, with significant numbers of false negatives, improvements to GICA are needed. Methods: Six recombinant HCoV-19 nucleocapsid and spike proteins were prepared and evaluated. The optimal proteins were employed to develop a sandwich-format GICA strip to detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG) against HCoV-19. GICA performance was assessed with comparison of viral RNA detection. Results: Recombinant HCoV-19 proteins were obtained, including three prokaryotically expressed rN, rN1, rN2 nucleocapsid proteins, and three eukaryotically expressed rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc spike proteins. The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) against coronavirus-specific IgM and IgG were chosen for GICA development. The GICA has a sensitivity and specificity of 86.89% (106/122) and 99.39% (656/660), respectively. Furthermore, 65.63% (21/32) of the clinically confirmed but RT-PCR negative samples were GICA positive. Conclusions: The eukaryotically-expressed spike proteins (rS1and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotically expressed nucleocapsid proteins for HCoV-19 serological diagnosis.

The extraordinary abilities of C. auris to easily contaminate the environment around colonized patients and persist for long periods have recently resulted in major outbreaks in many countries. C. auris resists elimination by robust cleaning and other decontamination procedures, likely due to the formation of dry biofilms. Susceptible hospitalized patients, particularly those with multiple comorbidities in intensive care settings, acquire C. auris rather easily from close contact with C. auris-infected patients, their environment, or the equipment used on colonized patients, often with fatal consequences. This review highlights the lessons learned from recent studies on the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, susceptibility, and molecular basis of resistance to antifungal drugs and infection control measures to combat the spread of C. auris infections in healthcare facilities. Particular emphasis is given to interventions aiming to prevent new infections in healthcare facilities, including the screening of susceptible patients for colonization; the cleaning and decontamination of the environment, equipment, and colonized patients; and successful approaches to identify and treat infected patients, particularly during outbreaks.","output":"Candida auris: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Pathogenesis, Antifungal Susceptibility, and Infection Control Measures to Combat the Spread of Infections in Healthcare Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To determine the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety among people with and without diabetes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study collecting demographic and mental health data from 2166 participants living in the Arab Gulf region (568 with diabetes, 1598 without diabetes). Depression and anxiety were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were 61% and 45%, in people with diabetes (PWD) and 62% and 44%, respectively, in people without diabetes. PWD who have had their diabetes visit canceled by the clinic were more likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms than those without diabetes (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.37 [1.02, 1.84] and 1.37 [1.04, 1.80], for depression and anxiety; respectively). PWD who had no method of telecommunication with their health care providers (HCP) during the pandemic, PWD with A1C of &#8805; 10%, women, employees (particularly HCPs), students, unmarried individuals, and those with lower income were more likely to report depression and/or anxiety symptoms (all P < 0.01). Fear of acquiring the coronavirus infection; running out of diabetes medications; or requiring hospitalization for hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis; and lack of telecommunication with HCPs were all associated with significantly higher odds of having depression and anxiety symptoms among PWD. CONCLUSIONS: The remarkably high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among subgroups of PWD, calls for urgent public health policies to address mental health during the pandemic and reestablish health care access for PWD.","output":"Determinants of mental health outcomes among people with and without diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Arab Gulf Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Centrosomes are composed of a centriolar core surrounded by a pericentriolar material (PCM) matrix that docks microtubule-nucleating -tubulin complexes. During mitotic entry, the PCM matrix increases in size and nucleating capacity in a process called centrosome maturation. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is recruited to centrosomes and phosphorylates PCM matrix proteins to drive their self-assembly, which leads to PCM expansion. Here, we show that in addition to controlling PCM expansion, PLK1 independently controls the generation of binding sites for -tubulin complexes on the PCM matrix. Selectively preventing the generation of PLK1-dependent -tubulin docking sites led to spindle defects and impaired chromosome segregation without affecting PCM expansion, highlighting the importance of phospho-regulated centrosomal -tubulin docking sites in spindle assembly. Inhibiting both -tubulin docking and PCM expansion by mutating substrate target sites recapitulated the effects of loss of centrosomal PLK1 on the ability of centrosomes to catalyze spindle assembly.","output":"Polo-like kinase 1 independently controls microtubule-nucleating capacity and size of the centrosome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It has become a global pandemic and its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine design. During viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus to enter the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated, and it is unclear how distinctive glycan types may modulate the interaction of RBD and ACE2. Detailed understanding of these determinants is key for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom simulations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii) RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans in ACE2, and (iii) RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations identify the key residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form contacts with higher probabilities, thus providing a quantitative evaluation that complements recent structural studies. Notably, we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not altered by the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2 interaction is robust. Applying our simulated results, we illustrate how the recently prevalent N501Y mutation may alter specific interactions with host ACE2 that facilitate the virus-host binding. Furthermore, our simulations reveal how the glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 can play a distinct role in the binding and unbinding of RBD. Finally, an energetics analysis shows that MAN9 glycans on ACE2 decrease RBD-ACE2 affinity, while FA2 glycans lead to enhanced binding of the complex. Together, our results provide a more comprehensive picture of the detailed interplay between virus and human receptor, which is much needed for the discovery of effective treatments that aim at modulating the physical-chemical properties of this virus.","output":"Exploring the Role of Glycans in the Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Human Receptor ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the past decade, global human movement created a virtually borderless world. Consequently, the developed world is facing forgotten and now imported infectious diseases. Many infections are observed upon travel and migration, and the clinical spectrum is diverse, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe septic shock. The severity of infection depends on the etiology and timeliness of diagnosis. While assessing the etiology of severe infection in travelers and migrants, it is important to acquire a detailed clinical history; geography, dates of travel, places visited, type of transportation, lay-overs and intermediate stops, potential exposure to exotic diseases, and activities that were undertaken during travelling and prophylaxis and vaccines either taken or not before travel are all important parameters. Tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, visceral leishmaniasis, enteric fever and hemorrhagic fever are the most common etiologies in severely infected travelers and migrants. The management of severe sepsis and septic shock in migrants and returning travelers requires a systematic approach in the evaluation of these patients based on travel history. Early and broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for the management of septic shock comprising broad spectrum antibiotics, source control, fluid therapy and hemodynamic support, corticosteroids, tight glycemic control, and organ support and monitoring.

METHODS: The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of KD patients without coronary artery lesions (N-CAL) and with CAA were collected during 2005C2020 at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The patients were divided into the development cohort and the validation cohort. First, we compared the general information, symptoms, and laboratory data of N-CAL and CAA patients in the development cohort and the total cohort and screened out the different indices by logistic regression analysis. Then, we established three models and compared the area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to identify meaningful models for CAA, which were further verified by decision curve analysis (DCA). Second, taking into account previous reports on the importance of gender to CAA, gender stratification was conducted. RESULTS: The analysis of clinical and blood indices revealed the following novel features: (i) Many factors were found to be related to CAA, including IVIG resistance and the symptoms of rash, oral changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy. (ii) The development cohort was analyzed by logistic regression, and three models were established. The ROC curves showed that Model 2, composed of IVIG resistance, rash, oral changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy, had a better AUC value and easily to evaluate in the prediction of CAA. (iii) The selected model for predicting CAA in the development cohort was further confirmed in the validation cohort through DCAs. (iv)We further compared the items enrolled in the three models above between the N-CAL and CAA groups by sex, and the results indicated that female KD patients without rash, oral changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy were more likely to develop CAA. CONCLUSION: The absence of rash, oral changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy are risk factors for CAA, especially in female KD patients.

Overall, 572 valid online questionnaires have been obtained from SME managers. The research model included five research constructs: CMPs, SMEs business characteristics, liquidity, managers' demographic characteristics, and their expectations for assistance. Results show that managers primarily rely on labour CMPs;liquidity, assistance from stakeholders, and governmental aid in dealing with the crisis. Results also indicate that SMEs' business characteristics, managers' demographic characteristics, and liquidity do not influence CMPs. The amount of provided governmental aid positively influences managers' expectations for assistance from other stakeholders of the business ecosystem, while the amount of SMEs' liquid assets negatively influences managers' expectations for governmental aid.

Case definitions have been published but lack clarity: clinical and radiological features are non-specific and rely heavily on mycological tests for which both a timely availability and accuracy pose an issue contributing to the wide range of incidence reported of 4%C34%. In April 2021, we introduced a CAPA guideline for ICU patients at St George's University Hospital including when to suspect and how to investigate for CAPA (see Figure 1). The aim of this study was to evaluate its utility in identifying patients meeting ECMM_ISHAM criteria for possible/probable CAPA.Figure 1. St George's Hospital CAPA Guideline 2021. Methods Between March 2020 and May 2021 a retrospective audit was completed that identified all PCR-confirmed COVID-19 ICU patients prescribed either voriconazole, caspofungin, anidulafungin and AmBisome and reviewed their medical records, imaging and microbiology results categorizing patients into proven, probable, possible or unlikely CAPA based on ECMM/ISHAM criteria. Results Twenty-one patients were prescribed the specified antifungals. All had CT imaging and varying microbiological investigations. Real-time clinical decisions on empirical antifungal prescribing for CAPA (start or stop) were made by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) comprising Microbiology and ICU physicians in light of clinical, microbiology and radiology findings. Nine of 21 patients prescribed empirical antifungals had radiological evidence of CAPA. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured in six patients from bronchoalveolar lavage and two patients from sputum/trachea. Of these, seven were deemed significant and one attributed to colonization. Two patients were diagnosed with probable and five as possible CAPA, of whom one died. All seven patients received antifungal treatment for CAPA of varying duration (range 18C49 days). Only one patient had an underlying host risk factor (B cell lymphoma). Of those defined with probable/possible CAPA, average time from intubation to treatment was 18.4 days (range 8C31) and from onset of COVID symptoms to treatment was 28.5 days (range 18C49). Three of 21 patients were treated empirically for CAPA and all 3 died prior to further investigation and 15 patients following an MDT were felt to have unlikely CAPA. Serum BDG and GM were negative in all patients with probable/possible CAPA. Conclusions The St George's CAPA guideline would have picked up two out of seven cases;two cases had antifungals started in another hospital so the utility of this guideline could not be assessed. Based on analysis of these cases the following changes were made to the guideline: (i) to assess patients 8 days post ICU admission (rather than 10 days) and (ii) assess patients following 3 days post appropriate antibiotic therapy (rather than following 5 days). Serum BDG and GM were negative in all patients with probable/possible CAPA prior to starting treatment therefore negative serum markers do not exclude diagnosis;this is consistent with experience reported elsewhere. Radiological presentations of CAPA were variable and wide ranging, and BAL sampling was not always possible, therefore we found the MDT approach including radiology, infection, respiratory and ICU invaluable in making decisions regarding treatment. This helped to reduce the use of fungal diagnostics, antifungal agents and appropriately manage patients with potential CAPA. The rationalization of antifungal use by the introduction of this guidelines was particularly important and also expedited the introduction of in-house fungal diagnostics.","output":"COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA): review of utility of local CAPA guideline and MDT in directing diagnosis and antifungal stewardship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics and CT imaging features of patients with different clinical types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), so as to provide a reference for the treatment and evaluation of COVID-19.

In countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain excess death estimates differed 2 to 4-fold between highest and lowest figures. The R values range exceeded 0.3 in all 33 countries. In 16 of 33 countries, the range of R exceeded 1. In 25 of 33 countries some calculations suggest R>1 (excess deaths exceeding COVID-19 deaths) while others suggest R<1 (excess deaths smaller than COVID-19 deaths). Inferred data from 4 evaluations for 42 countries and from 3 evaluations for another 98 countries are very tenuous Estimates of excess deaths are analysis-dependent and age-adjustment is important to consider. Excess deaths may be lower than previously calculated.","output":"Comparison of pandemic excess mortality in 2020-2021 across different empirical calculations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The occurrence of COVID-19 has already made us all to live in this New Normal.

METHODS We mined coronavirus-related tweets from January 23rd to March 25th, 2020. We classified tweets by the socioeconomic status of the county from which they originated with the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). We applied topic modeling to identify and monitor topics of concern over time. We investigated how topics varied by ADI and between hotspots and non-hotspots. RESULTS We identified 45 topics in 269,556 unique tweets. Topics shifted from early-outbreak-related content in January, to the presidential election and governmental response in February, to lifestyle impacts in March. High-resourced areas (low ADI) were concerned with stocks and social distancing, while under-resourced areas shared negative expression and discussion of the CARES Act relief package. These differences were consistent within hotspots, with increased discussion regarding employment in high ADI hotspots. DISCUSSION Topic modeling captures major concerns on Twitter in the early months of COVID-19. Our study extends previous Twitter-based research as it assesses how topics differ based on a marker of socioeconomic status. Comparisons between low and high-resourced areas indicate more focus on personal economic hardship in less-resourced communities and less focus on general public health messaging. CONCLUSION Real-time social media analysis of community-based pandemic responses can uncover differential conversations correlating to local impact and income, education, and housing disparities. In future public health crises, such insights can inform messaging campaigns, which should partly focus on the interests of those most disproportionately impacted.","output":"Twitter-based analysis reveals differential COVID-19 concerns across areas with socioeconomic disparities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have significant potential in the healthcare field Ethical and practical concerns, challenges, and complexities of using drones for specific and diverse healthcare purposes have been minimally explored to date This paper aims to document and advance awareness of diverse context-specific concerns, challenges, and complexities encountered by individuals working on the front lines of drones for health It draws on original qualitative research and data from semi-structured interviews (N = 16) with drones for health program managers and field staff in nine countries Directed thematic analysis was used to analyze interviews and identify key ethical and practical concerns, challenges, and complexities experienced by participants in their work with drones for health projects While some concerns, challenges, and complexities described by study participants were more technical in nature, for example, those related to drone technology and approval processes, the majority were not The bulk of context-specific concerns and challenges identified by participants, we propose, could be mitigated through community engagement initiatives","output":"Context-Specific Challenges, Opportunities, and Ethics of Drones for Healthcare Delivery in the Eyes of Program Managers and Field Staff: A Multi-Site Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aimed to present the impact of coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic on seeking treatment in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) and compare the clinical characteristics, demographics, and laboratory analysis of patients with ED during and before the pandemic period.

Although many diabetes technologies, such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors, have been established, the data from these devices are rarely assessed. Furthermore, telemedicine has not been sufficiently integrated into clinical workflows. OBJECTIVE: We sought to remotely support children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers, enhance the clinical outcomes and quality of life of children with diabetes, increase multiple stakeholders' engagement with digital care via a participatory approach, evaluate the feasibility of using an interoperable open-source platform in a university hospital setting, and analyze the success factors and barriers of transitioning from conventional care to digital care. METHODS: Service design methods were used to adapt clinical workflows. Remote consultations were performed on a monthly and on-demand basis. Diabetes device data were uploaded from patients' homes to an open-source platform. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were assessed before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown period in Germany. RESULTS: A total of 28 children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers enrolled in this study and completed 6 months of remote visits. Of these 28 participants, 16 (57%) also opted to attend at least one of their regular visits remotely. After 3 months of remote visits, participants' time in range (P=.001) and time in hyperglycemia (P=.004) significantly improved, and their time in hypoglycemia did not increase. These improvements were maintained during the COVID-19 lockdown period (ie, between months 3 and 6 of this study). Participants' psychosocial health improved after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Remote consultations and commonly shared data access can improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life of children with type 1 diabetes, even during challenging circumstances. A service design approach helped with the delivery of comprehensive and holistic solutions that accounted for the needs of multiple stakeholders. Our findings can inform the future integration of digital tools into clinical care during and beyond the pandemic.

Recent advances in deep convolutional neural network technology have opened up an opportunity to achieve end-to-end segmenting the brain tumor areas. However, the medical image data used in brain tumor segmentation are relatively scarce and the appearance of brain tumors is varied, so that it is difficult to find a learnable pattern to directly describe tumor regions. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modalities interactive feature learning framework to segment brain tumors from the multi-modalities data. The core idea is that the multi-modality MR data contain rich patterns of the normal brain regions, which can be easily captured and can be potentially used to detect the non-normal brain regions, i.e., brain tumor regions. The proposed multi-modalities interactive feature learning framework consists of two modules: cross-modality feature extracting module and attention guided feature fusing module, which aim at exploring the rich patterns cross multi-modalities and guiding the interacting and the fusing process for the rich features from different modalities. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the BraTS 2018 benchmark, which show that the proposed cross-modality feature learning framework can effectively improve the brain tumor segmentation performance when compared with the baseline methods and state-of-the-art methods.","output":"Brain Tumor Segmentation via Multi-Modalities Interactive Feature Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging viral diseases have increased in recent decades.

On average, students reported low to medium scores on stress and anxiety both before and after the assessment period. Results of network analyses showed that students experienced social unease in relation to accumulating difficulties at university and vice versa. Furthermore, there were clusters of different states of social unease next to clusters of stress, anger, loss of control, and feeling upset.

Traditionally in deep learning-based human activity recognition approaches, either a few random frames or every k(th) frame of the video is considered for training the 3D CNN, where k is a small positive integer, like 4, 5, or 6. This kind of sampling reduces the volume of the input data, which speeds-up the training network and also avoids overfitting to some extent, thus enhancing the performance of the 3D CNN model.

It has already been over a century postthe Spanish Flu pandemic, and we are witnessing a new type of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for Covid-19. It emerged from the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and within a few months, the virus propagated itself globally now resulting more than 50 million cases with over 1 million deaths. The high infection rates coupled with dynamic population movement demands for tools, especially within a Brazilian context, that will support health managers to develop policies for controlling and combating the new virus. Methods: In this work, we propose a tool for real-time spatio-temporal analysis using a machine learning approach. The COVID-SGIS system brings together routinely collected health data on Covid-19 distributed across public health systems in Brazil, as well as taking to under consideration the geographic and time-dependent features of Covid-19 so as to make spatio-temporal predictions. The data are sub-divided by federative unit and municipality. In our case study, we made spatio-temporal predictions of the distribution of cases and deaths in Brazil and in each federative unit. Four regression methods were investigated: linear regression, support vector machines (polynomial kernels and RBF), multilayer perceptrons, and random forests. We use the percentage RMSE and the correlation coefficient as quality metrics. Results: For qualitative evaluation, we made spatio-temporal predictions for the period from 25 to 27 May 2020. Considering qualitatively and quantitatively the case of the State of Pernambuco and Brazil as a whole, linear regression presented the best prediction results (thematic maps with good data distribution, correlation coefficient >0.99 and RMSE (%) <4% for Pernambuco and around 5% for Brazil) with low training time: [0.00; 0.04 ms], CI 95%. Conclusion: Spatio-temporal analysis provided a broader assessment of those in the regions where the accumulated confirmed cases of Covid-19 were concentrated. It was possible to differentiate in the thematic maps the regions with the highest concentration of cases from the regions with low concentration and regions in the transition range.

They enable risk stratifying patients based on individual risk of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy including diabetic macular edema (DME), and predicting which patients with DME best respond to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy. SUMMARY: Progress in artificial intelligence and tele-ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy screening, including artificial intelligence applications in 'real-world settings' and cost-effectiveness studies are summarized. Furthermore, the initial research on the use of artificial intelligence models for diabetic retinopathy risk stratification and management of DME are outlined along with potential future directions. Finally, the need for artificial intelligence adoption within ophthalmology in response to coronavirus disease 2019 is discussed. Digital health solutions such as artificial intelligence and telehealth can facilitate the integration of community, primary and specialist eye care services, optimize the flow of patients within healthcare networks, and improve the efficiency of diabetic retinopathy management.","output":"Artificial intelligence for diabetic retinopathy screening, prediction and management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to make a deadly impact on human life all over the world. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the changes in clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients over time. METHODS: We recruited 896 patients who were admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 30th January 2020 and 16st March 2020. We conducted a retrospective study collecting clinical characteristics, radiologic and laboratory findings, treatments administered, and clinical outcomes in the patients. The data collected were compared between patients with onset of illness in January 2020 and patients with onset of illness in February 2020, in Wuhan, China. Categorical data and non-normally distributed continuous data were examined by the &#967;2 test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test respectively, and the Kaplan-Meier plot was used to analyze survival data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 896 patients were enrolled; the median age was 60 (range, 47-69) years, 685 (76.5%) were categorized into group A (patients with onset of illness in January 2020), and 211 (23.5%) were categorized into group B (patients with onset of illness in February 2020). Compared with group B, group A had a higher incidence of fever (P<0.001), and a lower rate of asymptomatic individuals (P<0.001). Group A patients had a higher incidence of neutrophilia (P=0.043), an elevated D-dimer (P<0.001), and an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P=0.002), but a lower incidence of a normal computed tomography (CT) scan (P=0.001). CD3 cell counts (P=0.015) and CD4 cell counts (P=0.04) were significantly reduced in group A patients. Critically ill patients were less frequent (P=0.005) and patients with milder disease were more common (P=0.001) in group B. The fatality rate was significantly less in group B patients (P=0.028). Multivariate regression indicated that older age (odds ratio 1.086, 95% CI: 1.061-1.111, per year increase; P<0.001) increased the risk of in-hospital death. Female sex (odds ratio 0.523, 95% CI: 0.316-0.865; P=0.012) and being in group B (odds ratio 0.423, 95% CI: 0.212-0.844; P=0.015) significantly decreased the risk of in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: The condition of patients with onset of illness in January was more serious than that of patients with onset of illness in February 2020. The time of onset of illness was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death comparing January and February 2020. Changing pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and improved healthcare may have contributed to the results, however, more basic research is required to support this hypothesis.","output":"Comparison and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 between January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) plays an essential role in peripheral artery disease (PAD), leading to improved functional status, increased quality of life, and reduced arterial stiffness. We aimed to assess factors associated with clinical improvement 6 months after enrolment in a rehabilitation program at an academic medical center in north-eastern Europe. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study on 97 patients with PAD admitted to a single tertiary referral center. At the 6-months follow-up, 75 patients (77.3%) showed improved clinical status.

In the present study, we aimed to perform a comparative evaluation of the conditions of cancer patients before and during the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to detect the impact of the pandemic on treatment delays that are associated with anxiety and depression in cancer patients. In addition, the effect of public transport use on treatment delays was examined. METHODS: BDI and BAI were administered to 595 breast, ovarian, colon and gastric cancer patients before and during the pandemic. The questionnaires were administered by the physician blindly, who was unaware of the delay of the patients. The number of days by which the patients delayed their treatment due to the fear of contamination were recorded retrospectively. Correlation analyses were performed between the obtained scores and treatment delays. RESULTS: The depression and anxiety levels in cancer patients were found to increase during the pandemic (p = 0.000), and this increase was positively correlated with the disruption of their treatment (p = 0.000, r = 0.81). Depression and anxiety levels and treatment delays were higher in elderly patients (p = 0.021). Depression and anxiety were more pronounced in female patients (p = 0.000). Moreover, treatment delays were more common in patients who had to use public transportation (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may increase anxiety and depression in cancer patients.

The targets of the designed siRNAs revealed no significant matches within the whole human genome, ruling out any possibilities for off-target silencing by the siRNAs. Characterization with different potential parameters of efficacy allowed selecting the finest siRNA among all the designed siRNA molecules. Further, validation assessment and target site accessibility prediction also rationalized the suitability of this siRNA molecule. Molecular docking study between the selected siRNA molecule and component of RNA interference (RNAi) pathway gave an excellent outcome. Molecular dynamics of two complexes: siRNA and argonaute complex, guide RNA, and target protein complex, have shown structural stability of these proteins.

Here, the SAT1-flipper plasmid was reengineered to contain a C. albicans codon optimized hygromycin B resistance gene (CaHygB). Cassettes were PCR-amplified from both SAT1-flipper and CaHygB-flipper plasmids using primers with homologous sequences flanking target genes of interest to serve as repair templates. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing proprietary CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), universal transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), and Cas9 protein were assembled in vitro and transformed, along with both repair templates, by electroporation into C. albicans. Homozygous deletion of the ADE2 gene results in red-pigmented colonies and this gene was used to validate our approach. Both in SC5314 and a variety of clinical isolates (529L, JS15, SJCA1, TW1), homozygous gene targeting was nearly 100% when plating on media containing nourseothricin and hygromycin B with transformation efficiencies exceeding 104 homozygous deletion mutants per g of DNA. A gene reversion system was also employed with plasmids pDUP3 and pDIS3 engineered to contain the ADH1 terminator and an overlap extension PCR-mediated approach combined with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting at the NEUT5 neutral locus. A variety of single or compound mutants (/als3, /cph1 /efg1, /ece1) and their revertant strains were constructed and phenotypically validated by a variety of assays, including biofilm formation, hyphal growth, and macrophage IL-1 response. Thus, we have established a cloning-free, modular system for highly efficient homozygous gene deletion and reversion in diverse isolates. IMPORTANCE Recently, phenotypic heterogeneity in Candida albicans isolates has been recognized as an underappreciated factor contributing to gene diversification and broadly impacts strain-to-strain antifungal resistance, fitness, and pathogenicity.

Using a modular PCR-mediated approach coupled with in vitro ribonucleoprotein assembly with commercial reagents, both SAT1- and CaHygB-flipper cassettes were simultaneously integrated at loci with high efficiency (104 transformants per g DNA) and upward of 99% homozygous gene targeting across a collection of diverse isolates of various anatomical origin. Revertant strains were constructed by overlap extension PCR with CRISPR-Cas9 targeted integration at the NEUT5 locus. Thus, this facile system will aid in unraveling the genetic factors contributing to the complexity of intraspecies diversity.","output":"Rapid Hypothesis Testing in Candida albicans Clinical Isolates Using a Cloning-Free, Modular, and Recyclable System for CRISPR-Cas9 Mediated Mutant and Revertant Construction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cognitive symptoms after COVID-19 have been increasingly recognized several months after the acute infection and have been designated as brain fog.

Recent mandates for social distancing and sheltering in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic have catapulted efforts to provide ongoing coordinated specialty care (CSC) on virtual platforms. While prior evidence provides support for the general implementation of virtual individual therapy, there is limited guidance and evidence for the adoption of group teletherapy. Here we describe our efforts to implement group teletherapy for two small cohorts of individuals with FEP receiving care in a coordinated specialty care clinic using methods adopted from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. We observed high adherence with group visits as well as client satisfaction across groups. Based on our results, we have taken efforts to implement virtual group therapy more permanently in our clinic. Our experience provides guidance and a model for integration of virtual group therapy within CSC. PRACTITIONER POINTS: In-person group therapy can be adapted as an online treatment modality for individuals with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Group teletherapy is both accessible and satisfactory to individuals with FEP. Group teletherapy has potential as a more standard and widespread treatment modality within coordinated specialty care for FEP.","output":"Group teletherapy for first-episode psychosis: Piloting its integration with coordinated specialty care during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing call for leadership development in academic health care and medical students desire more training in this area. Although many schools offer combined MD/MBA programs or leadership training in targeted areas, these programs do not often align with medical school leadership competencies and are limited in reaching a large number of students. METHODS: The Leadership Initiative (LI) was a program created by a partnership between a School of Medicine (SOM) and Business School with a learning model that emphasized the progression from principles to practice, and the competencies of self-awareness, communication, and collaboration/teamwork. Through offerings across a medical school curriculum, the LI introduced leadership principles and provided an opportunity to apply them in an interactive activity or simulation. We utilized the existing SOM evaluation platform to collect data on program outcomes that included satisfaction, fidelity to the learning model, and impact. RESULTS: From 2017 to 2020, over 70% of first-year medical students participated in LI course offerings while a smaller percentage of fourth-year students engaged in the curriculum. Most students had no prior awareness of LI course material and were equivocal about their ability to apply lessons learned to their medical school experience. Students reported that the LI offerings provided opportunities to practice the skills and competencies of self-awareness, communication, and collaboration/teamwork. DISCUSSION: Adding new activities to an already crowded medical curriculum was the greatest logistical challenge. The LI was successful in introducing leadership principles but faced obstacles in having participants apply and practice these principles. Most students reported that the LI offerings were aligned with the foundational competencies.","output":"Medical Student Leadership Development through a Business School Partnership Model: A Case Study and Implementation Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the issue of the COVID-19 pandemic is very shocking to the world, it has altered the pattern of human life toward a new life order.

The hypothesis indicated that the level of economic consciousness was higher than the level of health consciousness during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The research method used was a quantitative method using surveys and it was complemented by direct interviews with respondents. RESULTS: The finding based on the economic level found that people with uncertain income were more concerned with economic consciousness than health consciousness. Besides, the societies with uncertain income, especially non-formal workers, were not so afraid of the coronavirus 19 and they did not care while contracting the virus, due to they have believed that life and death have been determined by God. Other results showed that respondents worked as small traders, medium and large entrepreneurs were also more concerned with economic consciousness rather than health consciousness, it revealed that the societies did not have regular income and they argued that COVID-19 was merely an ordinary virus. CONCLUSION: Respondents who were employees, health workers and other professions who had regular income, they tended to pay more attention to health consciousness than economic consciousness due to these societies had sufficient savings if they selected the quarantine at home.","output":"Assessing the level of economic consciousness and the level of health consciousness of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood transfusions have been the cornerstone of life support since the introduction of the ABO classification in the 20th century. The physiologic goal is to restore adequate tissue oxygenation when the demand exceeds the offer. Although it can be a life-saving therapy, blood transfusions can lead to serious adverse effects, and it is essential that physicians remain up to date with the current literature and are aware of the pathophysiology, initial management and risks of each type of transfusion reaction. We aim to provide a structured overview of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach and management of acute transfusion reactions based on the literature available in 2022. The numbers of blood transfusions, transfusion reactions and the reporting rate of transfusion reactions differ between countries in Europe. The most frequent transfusion reactions in 2020 were alloimmunizations, febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and allergic transfusion reactions. Transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload and septic transfusion reactions were less frequent. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the healthcare system with decreasing blood donations and blood supplies, as well as rising concerns within the medical community but also in patients about blood safety and transfusion reactions in COVID-19 patients. The best way to prevent transfusion reactions is to avoid unnecessary blood transfusions and maintain a transfusion-restrictive strategy. Any symptom occurring within 24 h of a blood transfusion should be considered a transfusion reaction and referred to the hemovigilance reporting system. The initial management of blood transfusion reactions requires early identification, immediate interruption of the transfusion, early consultation of the hematologic and ICU departments and fluid resuscitation.","output":"Blood Transfusion ReactionsA Comprehensive Review of the Literature including a Swiss Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy is currently one of the countries seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nutritional supplementation may counter malnutrition and enhance pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes but rigorous evidence is absent. We aimed to investigate the effect of high-protein supplementation (Fortisip Compact Protein (FCP)) during pulmonary rehabilitation on exercise capacity. METHODS: This was a double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing FCP (intervention) with PreOp (a carbohydrate control supplement) in COPD patients participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. Participants consumed the supplement twice a day during pulmonary rehabilitation and attended twice-weekly pulmonary rehabilitation sessions, with pre- and post-pulmonary rehabilitation measurements, including the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance at 6 weeks as the primary outcome. Participants experience using supplements was assessed. RESULTS: 68 patients were recruited (intervention n=36 and control n=32). The trial was stopped early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although statistical significance was not reached, there was the suggestion of a clinically meaningful difference in the ISWT distance at 6 weeks favouring the intervention group (intervention 342149 m (n=22) versus control 305148 m (n=22); p=0.1). Individuals who achieved an improvement in the ISWT had a larger mid-thigh circumference at baseline (responders 624 cm versus nonresponders 556 cm; p=0.006). 79% of the patients were satisfied with the taste and 43% would continue taking the FCP.

More than half of veterans who meet mental illness criteria do not seek help. This study screened for clinical symptoms and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, online social-contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. We hypothesized that the video-based intervention would increase treatment-seeking intentions more than written vignette and control conditions. METHODS: One hundred seventy-two veterans were randomized to either a (a) brief video-based intervention; (b) written vignette intervention, or (c) nonintervention control group. In the 3-min video, a veteran previously diagnosed with PTSD described his symptom reactivation by Covid-19, his barriers to care, and how therapy helped him to cope. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. RESULTS: A total of 91 (53%) veterans reported high levels of clinical symptoms, especially those self-reporting Covid-19 exposure. The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increase in treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. Within the video group, women showed an increase in treatment-seeking intentions from baseline to postintervention only, whereas men showed a more sustained effect, from baseline to Day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed veterans reported high symptoms levels. A brief video intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, likely through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist.

Staple line buttress reinforcement has been suggested to reduce these postoperative complications. Our objective was to assess staple line buttress reinforcement via the Duet? tissue reinforcement stapler system in morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG as part of a comprehensive weight management strategy, focusing on postoperative complications. METHODS Between January 2008 and April 2011, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 116 consecutive patients that underwent LSG with staple line buttress reinforcement at an academic teaching hospital with advanced bariatric fellowship. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 44.3  9.5 years, with mean preoperative BMI of 44  7 kg/m2. The mean operative time to perform LSG was 96  25 min.

However, recent studies have indicated that the molecular mechanisms of monogenic diseases can be unexpectedly complicated, and their understanding requires complex studies at the molecular level. Previously, we have demonstrated that in mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), a group of monogenic lysosomal storage diseases, several hundreds of genes reveal significant changes in the expression of various genes. Although the secondary effects of the primary biochemical defect and the inefficient degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) might be considered, the scale of the changes in the expression of a large fraction of genes cannot be explained by a block in one biochemical pathway. Here, we demonstrate that in cellular models of 11 types of MPS, the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in the regulation of the expression of many other genes at various stages (such as signal transduction, transcription, splicing, RNA degradation, translation, and others) is significantly disturbed relative to the control cells. This conclusion was based on transcriptomic studies, supported by biochemical analyses of levels of selected proteins encoded by genes revealing an especially high level of dysregulation in MPS (EXOSC9, SRSF10, RPL23, and NOTCH3 proteins were investigated). Interestingly, the reduction in GAGs levels, through the inhibition of their synthesis normalized the amounts of EXOSC9, RPL23, and NOTCH3 in some (but not all) MPS types, while the levels of SRSF10 could not be corrected in this way. These results indicate that different mechanisms are involved in the dysregulation of the expression of various genes in MPS, pointing to a potential explanation for the inability of some therapies (such as enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy) to fully correct the physiology of MPS patients. We suggest that the disturbed expression of some genes, which appears as secondary or tertiary effects of GAG storage, might not be reversible, even after a reduction in the amounts of the storage material.","output":"Complex Changes in the Efficiency of the Expression of Many Genes in Monogenic Diseases, Mucopolysaccharidoses, May Arise from Significant Disturbances in the Levels of Factors Involved in the Gene Expression Regulation Processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To examine insomnia disorder and its association with sociodemographic factors and poor mental health in 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) inpatients in Wuhan, China.

Traditionally, these services are funded predominantly through tax-based allocations, supplemented by other streams such as earned revenue, dedicated levies, and sponsorship agreements. Cost-cutting measures such as outsourcing, overall staffing reductions, and an increasing reliance on a parttime workforce have also become increasingly common in the context of local park and recreation service delivery. Partnership with nonprofit organizations represents another potential strategy to adequately fund local park and recreation services.Partnerships between local park and recreation agencies and nonprofit park and recreation foundations have a long history, and help support local park and recreation agencies in a variety of capacities. Their importance may also be growing as a function of the decline in tax-based support and earned revenue due to both the Great Recession and the global COVID-19 pandemic. Such partnerships are not unique to local parks and recreation however, and are commonand widely studiedat the national and transnational level. Despite their importance to local park and recreation service delivery, and the established body of knowledge examining these partnerships at the national and transnational level, the local agency-foundation relationship remains understudied. In this manuscript we begin to address this gap by providing a clearer picture of the agency-foundation relationship, and identifying strategies for how local park and recreation agencies can most effectively leverage these partnerships. To do so, we employ a qualitative research method, interviewing leaders from both local public park and recreation agencies and nonprofit park foundations. Results illustrate a variety of motivations for initiating an agency-foundation relationship (funding/capacity, deteriorating conditions, and equity), as well as a number of distinct benefits of such a partnership (increased operational capacity, advocacy and outreach, expertise, and non-governmental status). Respondents also identified various characteristics of a successful agency-foundation relationship (effective communication, clear roles and responsibilities, strong connections, and flexibility/responsiveness), and challenges to success (competition for scarce resources, and equity). Based on these results, we propose several strategies to help local park and recreation agencies maximize these partnerships (communicate frequently and with purpose, build relationships, formalize ties, and strive for equitable outcomes).

This has tended to focus on parent reports and experiments, rather than asking autistic people about their own experiences and preferences regarding communication.What does this article add?This article is the first to ask autistic adults how they prefer to communicate in different scenarios. We asked whether they preferred to use a range of methods, such email, phone calls, letters and live messaging, in scenarios from education to customer services to friends and family. When contacting unknown people or organisations, we found that generally email was preferred, and phone calls were very unpopular.

They should make sure that access to support is not dependent on the phone, and instead offer written options such as email and live messaging which are more accessible.

Herein, we report in vivo protein topology engineering using highly efficient, mechanically interlocking SpyX modules named AXB and BXA. SpyX modules are protein domains composed of p53dim (X), SpyTag (A), and SpyCatcher (B). The p53dim guides the intertwining of the two nascent protein chains followed by autocatalytic isopeptide bond formation between SpyTag and SpyCatcher to fulfill the interlocking, leading to a variety of backbone topologies. Direct expression of AXB or BXA produces protein catenanes with distinct ring sizes. Recombinant proteins containing SpyX modules are obtained either as mechanically interlocked obligate dimers if the protein of interest is fused to the N- or C-terminus of SpyX modules, or as star proteins if the protein is fused to both N- and C-termini. As examples, cellular syntheses of dimers of (GB1)(2) (where GB1 stands for immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G) and of four-arm elastin-like star proteins were demonstrated. Comparison of the catenation efficiencies in different constructs reveals that BXA is generally much more effective than AXB, which is rationalized by the arrangement of three domains in space. Mechanical interlocking induces considerable stability enhancement. Both AXB and BXA have a melting point 20 C higher than the linear controls and the BXA catenane has a melting point ~2 C higher than the cyclic control BXA. Notably, four-arm elastin-like star proteins demonstrate remarkable tolerance against trypsin digestion. The SpyX modules provide a convenient and versatile approach to construct unconventional protein topologies via the assembly-reaction synergy, which opens a new horizon in protein science for stability enhancement and function reinforcement via topology engineering.","output":"Topology Engineering of Proteins in Vivo Using Genetically Encoded, Mechanically Interlocking SpyX Modules for Enhanced Stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus taxonomy emerged as a discipline in the middle of the twentieth century. Traditionally, classification by virus taxonomists has been focussed on the grouping of relatively closely related viruses. However, during the past few years, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has recognized that the taxonomy it develops can be usefully extended to include the basal evolutionary relationships among distantly related viruses. Consequently, the ICTV has changed its Code to allow a 15-rank classification hierarchy that closely aligns with the Linnaean taxonomic system and may accommodate the entire spectrum of genetic divergence in the virosphere. The current taxonomies of three human pathogens, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 are used to illustrate the impact of the expanded rank structure. This new rank hierarchy of virus taxonomy will stimulate further research on virus origins and evolution, and vice versa, and could promote crosstalk with the taxonomies of cellular organisms.","output":"The new scope of virus taxonomy: partitioning the virosphere into 15 hierarchical ranks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the systemic and pulmonary macrohemodynamics in early COVID-19 infection. Echocardiography may provide useful insights into COVID-19 physiopathology. METHODS: Twenty-three COVID-19 patients were enrolled in a medical ward. Gas exchange, transthoracic echocardiographic, and hemodynamic variables were collected. RESULTS: Mean age was 57  17 years. The patients were hypoxemic (PaO2 /FiO2 = 273.0  102.6 mmHg) and mildly hypocapnic (PaCO2 = 36.2  6.3 mmHg, pH = 7.45  0.03). Mean arterial pressure was decreased (86.7 [80.0-88.3] mmHg). Cardiac index was elevated (4.32  0.90 Lamin-1 am-2 ) and the resulting systemic vascular resistance index low (1,458 [1358-1664] dynasacm-5 am-2 ). The right heart was morphologically and functionally normal, with pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm, 18.0  2.9 mmHg) and Total Pulmonary Resistances (TPR, 2.3 [2.1-2.7] mmHgal-1 amin-1 ) within normal limits. When stratifying for SVRI, patients with an SVRI value below the cohort median had also more severe oxygenation impairment and lower TPR, despite a similar degree of CXR infiltrates. Oxygen delivery index in this group resulted supranormal. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stages of COVID-19 infection the hemodynamic profile is characterized by a hyperdynamic circulatory state with high CI and low SVRI, while the right heart is functionally unaffected. Our findings suggest that hypoxemia, viral sepsis or peripheral shunting are possible mechanisms for the vasodilation that dominates at this stage of the disease and may itself worsen the gas exchange.","output":"Non-invasive hemodynamic profile of early COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with that in a matched cohort with similar cardiovascular risk factors and the effects of DVT and PE on the hospital course. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized from March 11, 2020 to September 4, 2020. The patients were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, hospital of admission, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with a cohort of patients without COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT/PE and the odds of developing DVT/PE using a conditional logistic regression model. The secondary endpoint was the hospitalization outcomes for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay, and length of hospitalization (LOH). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with mortality, ICU admission, discharge disposition, ICU duration, and LOH. RESULTS: A total of 13,310 patients had tested positive for COVID-19, 915 of whom (6.9%) had been hospitalized across our multisite health care system. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 60.8  17.0 years, and 396 (43.3%) were women. Of the 915 patients, 82 (9.0%) had had a diagnosis of DVT/PE confirmed by ultrasound examination of the extremities and/or computed tomography angiography of the chest. The odds of presenting with DVT/PE in the setting of COVID-19 infection was greater than that without COVID-19 infection (0.6% [5 of 915] vs 9.0% [82 of 915]; odds ratio [OR], 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-51.2; P < .001). The vascular risk factors were not different between the COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE. Mortality (P = .02), the need for ICU stay (P < .001), duration of ICU stay (P < .001), and LOH (P < .001) were greater in the DVT/PE cohort than in the cohort without DVT/PE. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the hemoglobin (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95; P = .04) and D-dimer (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.33-1.56; P = .03) levels were associated with higher mortality. Higher activated partial thromboplastin times (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12; P = .03) and higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .05) were associated with a greater risk of ICU admission. IL-6 (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .05) was associated with a greater risk of rehabilitation placement after discharge. On multivariable gamma regression analysis, hemoglobin (coefficient, -3.0; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P = .005) was associated with a prolonged ICU stay, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (coefficient, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.003-0.006; P = .05), international normalized ratio (coefficient, -3.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P = .002) and IL-6 (coefficient, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.0011-0.0027; P = .02) were associated with a prolonged LOH. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater incidence of DVT/PE occurred in hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Patients affected by DVT/PE were more likely to experience greater mortality, to require ICU admission, and experience prolonged ICU stays and LOH compared with COVID-19-positive patients without DVT/PE.

DESIGN Qualitative interview study. METHOD Ten NHS commissioners and managers participated in a semi-structured, co-produced interview. Each transcribed interview was double-coded and thematically analysed using The Framework Method. RESULTS Interviews generated three main themes. (1) Capacity issues across psychological therapy services create barriers to face-to-face therapies, and Internet-based interventions offer a solution. (2) Despite reservations, there is growing acceptance of Internet-based therapies. Different ways of connecting with patients are required, and Internet-based treatments are accessible and empowering treatment options, with guided self-help (GSH) preferred. Internet-based interventions may however exclude some individuals and be a threat to the therapeutic relationship between patient and practitioner. (3) Successful roll-out of Internet-based interventions would be facilitated by a strong empirical- or practice-based evidence, a national coordinated approach and timely training and supervision. Barriers to the roll-out include digital intervention set-up costs and delays due to NHS inflexibility. CONCLUSIONS The study highlights factors influencing access to Internet-based therapies, important given the rapid evolution of e-therapies, and particularly timely given increasing use of remote therapies due to COVID-19 restrictions. Interviewees were open to Internet-based approaches, particularly GSH interventions, so long as they do not compromise on therapy quality. Interviewees acknowledged implementation may be challenging, and recommendations were offered. PRACTITIONER POINTS There is a shift in practice and increasingly positive views from NHS staff around remote psychological therapies and different ways of connecting with patients, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a strong preference for Internet-based psychological interventions that are guided and that include built-in outcome measures co-produced with service users. There is a need to raise awareness of the growing evidence base for Internet-based psychological therapies, including research examining therapeutic alliance across Internet-based and face-to-face therapies. Challenges implementing Internet-based psychological therapies include therapist resistance to changing working practices in general, and inflexibility of the NHS, and national, coordinated implementation efforts are encouraged.","output":"Internet-based psychological therapies: A qualitative study of National Health Service commissioners and managers views."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although many deem intermittent fasting (IF) a healthy dietary regimen, there is a paucity of scientific evidence to corroborate IF health benefits in human studies. However, its comparative ease and the emphasized benefits in the light of COVID-19 (e.g., weight loss and immunization improvement) have led to the increase of IF adoption. A vast number of intermittent fasters have not sought consultation from health professionals, which can bring adverse health effects. Most intermittent fasters use mobile apps to get assistance for IF. Types of assistance offered by the IF mobile applications may range from tracking (e.g., fasting periods, calorie intake) to obtaining knowledge about IF.

Thus, we organized our study into two stages for establishing design implications that further encourage a safety-conscious and user-friendly IF experience. We first investigated how IF app users who have chosen apps that provide extensive IF-specific knowledge acquire the said knowledge via (i) topic modeling of user app reviews, (ii) detecting modularity in co-word maps drawn from reviews specific to IF information acquisition, (iii) locating the position of keywords indicating information acquisition in the reviews.

Here, the full-length genome of this Belgian NIBV reference strain was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) to understand its evolutionary relationship with other IBV strains, and to identify possible genetic factors that may be associated with the nephropathogenicity. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the B1648 strain (5UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c and 6b, which have been rarely reported in literature, were present in B1648 and most of the other IBV complete genomes.

The response to COVID-19 in the United States has been hampered by an overall lack of diagnostic testing capacity. To address uncertainty about ongoing levels of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission early in the pandemic, we aimed to develop a surveillance tool using readily available emergency department (ED) operations data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). This involved optimizing the identification of acute respiratory infection (ARI)-related encounters and then comparing metrics for these encounters before and after the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. METHODS: We performed an observational study using operational EHR data from two Midwest EDs with a combined annual census of over 80,000. Data were collected three weeks before and after the first confirmed case of local SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. To optimize capture of ARI cases, we compared various metrics including chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and ARI-related orders. Operational metrics for ARI cases, including volume, pathogen identification, and illness severity, were compared between the preand post-community transmission timeframes using chi-square tests of independence. RESULTS: Compared to our combined definition of ARI, chief complaint, discharge diagnoses, and isolation orders individually identified less than half of the cases. Respiratory pathogen testing was the top performing individual ARI definition but still only identified 72.2% of cases. From the pre to post periods, we observed significant increases in ED volumes due to ARI and ARI cases without identified pathogen. CONCLUSION: Certain methods for identifying ARI cases in the ED may be inadequate and multiple criteria should be used to optimize capture. In the absence of widely available SARS-CoV-2 testing, operational metrics for ARI-related encounters, especially the proportion of cases involving negative pathogen testing, are useful indicators for active surveillance of potential COVID-19 related ED visits.","output":"Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance for Community Transmitted COVID-19 in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper uncovers the (in)justices that arise from the three cases of ongoing transport system transition in the Philippines, namely the (nonC)legitimation of motorcycle taxis, the formalization of jeepney and the implementation of high-priority bus system These three cases are touted as potential transition pathways to sustainable mobility in the Philippines Originally a method developed for the appraisal of contested visions, multi-criteria mapping (MCM) is used in this study to analyze interview data elicited from 17 stakeholders/specialists, representing a diversity of perspectives, through the five lenses of (in)justice (distributive, procedural, recognition, cosmopolitan and restorative) Just transition is understudied in the transportation literature, and this research identifies the equitable outcomes the three transition initiatives aim to achieve and the historical inequities they seek to remedy, but also, and more importantly, unpack injustice issues implicated in them which, being sources of tension, conflict and discontent, may powerfully resist the hoped-for sustainable transitions The article ends with some policies, drawn from the cases that may ensure just transition for all","output":"Unpacking justice issues and tensions in transport system transition using multi-criteria mapping method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the research field and industrial market of in vitro diagnosis (IVD) thrived during and post the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of isothermal nucleic acid amplification test (INAAT) based rapid diagnosis was engendered in a global wised large measure as a problem-solving exercise.

Endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) is a replication-defective provirus found in species belonging to the Felis genus, which includes the domestic cat (Felis catus). There have been few studies examining interaction between enFeLV genotype and FeLV progression. We examined point-in-time enFeLV and FeLV viral loads, as well as occurrence of FeLV/enFeLV recombinants (FeLV-B), to determine factors relating to clinical disease in a closed breeding colony of cats during a natural infection of FeLV. Coinfections with feline foamy virus (FFV), feline gammaherpesvirus 1 (FcaGHV-1), and feline coronavirus (FCoV) were also documented and analyzed for impact on cat health and FeLV disease. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling techniques were used to measure interactions among disease parameters. Progressive FeLV disease and FeLV-B presence were associated with higher FeLV proviral and plasma viral loads. Female cats were more likely to have progressive disease and FeLV-B. Conversely, enFeLV copy number was higher in male cats and negatively associated with progressive FeLV disease. Males were more likely to have abortive FeLV disease. FFV proviral load was found to correlate positively with higher FeLV proviral and plasma viral load, detection of FeLV-B, and FCoV status. Male cats were much more likely to be infected with FcaGHV-1 than female cats. This analysis provides insights into the interplay between endogenous and exogenous FeLV during naturally occurring disease and reveals striking variation in the infection patterns among four chronic viral infections of domestic cats.IMPORTANCE Endogenous retroviruses are harbored by many animals, and their interactions with exogenous retroviral infections have not been widely studied. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a relevant model system to examine this question, as endogenous and exogenous forms of the virus exist. In this analysis of a large domestic cat breeding colony naturally infected with FeLV, we documented that enFeLV copy number was higher in males and inversely related to FeLV viral load and associated with better FeLV disease outcomes. Females had lower enFeLV copy numbers and were more likely to have progressive FeLV disease and FeLV-B subtypes. FFV viral load was correlated with FeLV progression. FFV, FcaGHV-1, and FeLV displayed markedly different patterns of infection with respect to host demographics.

At present, the traditional methods for identifying genetically modified and non-transgenic soybeans are time-consuming, costly, and complicated to operate, which cannot meet the needs of practical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to discover a fast and accurate method for identifying transgenic soybeans. Terahertz (THz) time domain spectra were collected in sequence from 225 transgenic and non-transgenic soybean samples. Fourier transform was used to convert the terahertz time domain spectrum into a THz frequency domain spectrum with a frequency range of 0.1-2.5 THz. Firstly, the interval partial least squares (iPLS) method was used to remove interference spectral bands and select appropriate spectral intervals. Secondly, 168 samples were selected as the calibration set. Discriminant partial least squares (DPLS), Grid Search support vector machine (Grid Search-SVM) and principal component analysis back propagation neural network (PCA-BPNN) were used to establish a qualitative identification model. Afterwards, 57 test set samples were predicted. By comparing the experimental results, it was found that iPLS could effectively screen and remove the interference THz band, which was more helpful to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the identification model. After the iPLS and mean center pre-treatment technology, the Grid Search-SVM identification model had the best identification effect, with a total accuracy rate of 98.25% (transgenic identification rate was 96.15%, non-transgenic identification rate was 100%).

A large body of research has documented the association between NFC and various cognitive, emotional and social processes. Despite considerable interest in psychology, little effort has been made to uncover the neural substrates of individual variations in NFC. Herein, we took a data-driven approach to predict NFC trait combining machine learning framework and the whole-brain grey matter volume (GMV) features, which represent a reliable brain imaging measure and have been commonly employed to explore neural basis underlying individual differences of cognition and behaviors. Brain regions contributing to the prediction were then subjected to functional connectivity and decoding analyses for a quantitative inference on their psychophysiological functions. Our results indicated that multivariate patterns of GMV derived from multiple regions across distributed brain systems predicted NFC at individual level. The contributing regions are distributed across the emotional processing network (e.g., striatum), cognitive control network (e.g., lateral prefrontal cortex), social cognition network (e.g., temporoparietal junction) and perceptual processing network (e.g., occipital cortex).

Although stress has been investigated during this pandemic, there are no reports on anxiety in neurosurgical patients undergoing nonurgent surgical procedures. METHODS: Neurosurgical patients admitted to hospitals in eastern Lombardy for nonurgent surgery after the lockdown prospectively completed a pre- and postoperative structured questionnaire. Recorded data included demographics, pathology, time on surgical waiting list, anxiety related to COVID-19, primary pathology and surgery, safety perception during hospital admission before and after surgery, and surgical outcomes. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Descriptive statistics were computed on the different variables and data were stratified according to pathology (oncological vs nononcological). Three different models were used to investigate which variables had the greatest impact on anxiety, oncological patients, and safety perception, respectively. Because the variables (Xs) were of a different nature (qualitative and quantitative), mostly asymmetrical, and related to outcome (Y) by nonlinear relationships, a machine learning approach composed of three steps (1, random forest growing; 2, relative variable importance measure; and 3, partial dependence plots) was chosen. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three patients from 10 different hospitals were included in the study. None of the patients developed COVID-19 after surgery. State and trait anxiety were reported by 30.3% and 18.9% of patients, respectively. Higher values of state anxiety were documented in oncological compared to nononcological patients (46.7% vs 25%; p = 0.055). Anxiety was strongly associated with worry about primary pathology, surgery, disease worsening, and with stress during waiting time, as expected. Worry about positivity to SARS-CoV-2, however, was the strongest factor associated with anxiety, even though none of the patients were infected. Neuro-oncological disease was associated with state anxiety and with worry about surgery and COVID-19. Increased bed distance and availability of hand sanitizer were associated with a feeling of safety.

For example, high levels of alcohol accompanied by the acidic damage and nutritional deficit exhibited in people with disordered eating habits - due to induced vomiting - has been shown to increase risk of esophageal cancer. Considering the very few studies done on disordered eating prevailing in males and the prevalence of smoking and drinking habits, our study aims to investigate the correlation between inappropriate eating habits and one's dependence on cigarettes, waterpipes, and alcohol all the while focusing on male adolescents. METHODS This was a cross-sectional observational study that enrolled 389 male students (13-17 years of age) drawn from five Lebanese schools between October and December 2019. RESULTS The MANCOVA analysis was performed taking the addiction scales as the dependent variables and the EAT-26 score as an independent variable, adjusting for the covariates (age, BMI and household crowding index). Higher EAT-26 scores (more inappropriate eating attitudes) were significantly associated with higher waterpipe dependence (B = 0.11; CI 0.06-0.17) and more problematic alcohol use (B = 0.08; CI 0.04-0.12), but not cigarette dependence. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed an association between inappropriate eating and increased drinking and smoking the waterpipe, but not cigarettes. The manifestation of inappropriate eating habits was found to be significant among male adolescents; in the literature, this is also true for female adolescents. In Lebanon, the engagement of adolescents in alcohol drinking and waterpipe smoking is frequent as they are accessible due to the lack of law enforcement and supervision in the country. In addition, while this study found an association between inappropriate eating habits and dependency on smoking and drinking, further investigation should be done on the role of one's psychology in their exhibition of disordered eating as means to prevent the manifestation of these habits.","output":"Relationships between inappropriate eating habits and problematic alcohol use, cigarette and waterpipe dependence among male adolescents in Lebanon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults.

RESULTS: All 69 patients (100%) tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at 2 months post-vaccination. Residents with a pre-vaccination infection had significantly higher titers of anti-spike 1 IgG than those with no prior infection (median [interquartile range]: 55,726 [14463C78852] vs. 1314 [272C1249] arbitrary units, respectively; p < 0.001).

We utilized Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to predict surgical volume in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic and utilized historical data to predict elective surgical recovery time. RESULTS: Median statewide monthly vascular surgical volume for the study period was 439 procedures, with a maximum statewide monthly case volume of 519 procedures.

Additionally, Chinas north-south gap in economic development has been widened in the past decade, and 11 cities with nationwide influence have prosperous development potential. This study provides a new lens for predicting Chinas economic development, as well as its spatial patterns.

The use of an acrylic box during intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation has been adopted worldwide. A study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of an acrylic box in limiting contamination. The findings indicate that healthcare workers are still vulnerable to exposure despite the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and an acrylic box. The causes of contamination were related to improper PPE donning and doffing and incomplete coverage by the acrylic box. Institutions should focus on ensuring proper donning and doffing of PPE and incorporating high-fidelity simulation training to prepare teams to resuscitate COVID-19 patients.","output":"How Clean Are You Really?

Ongoing LAMP reactions within the emulsion droplets cause a decrease in interfacial tension, causing a decrease in droplet size, which results in decreased light scatter intensity due to Mie theory. Light scatter intensity was monitored via spectrophotometers and fiber optic cables placed at 30 and 60. Light scatter intensities collected at 3 min, 30 were able to statistically differentiate 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/L initial Escherichia coli O157:H7 concentrations compared to NTC (0 CFU/L), while the intensity at 60 were able to statistically differentiate 10(6) CFU/L initial concentrations and NTC. Control experiments were conducted to validate nucleic acid detection versus bacterial adsorption, finding that the light scatter intensities change is due specifically to ongoing LAMP amplification. After inducing contamination of bulk LAMP reagents, specificity lowered to 0% with conventional LAMP, while the eLAMP platform showed 87.5% specificity.

Hence, we design a COVID-19 testing kit supply network (C-19TKSN) to allocate various C-19 test kits to the suspected C-19 cases depending on the time between the emergence of their first symptoms and the time they are tested. In particular, this model aims to minimize the total network cost and decrease false results C-19 test by considering the fundamental characteristics of a diagnostic C-19 test (i.e., specificity and sensitivity). In the sensitivity characteristic, a gamma formula is presented to estimate the error rate of false-negative results. The nature of the C-19TKSN problem is dynamic over time due to difficult predictions and changes in the number of C-19 patients. For this reason, we consider the potential demands relating to different regions of the suspected C-19 cases for various C-19 test kits and the rate of prevalence of C-19 as stochastic parameters. Accordingly, a multi-stage stochastic programming (MSSP) method with a combined scenario tree is proposed to deal with the stochastic data in a dynamic environment. Then, a fuzzy approach is employed based on [Formula: see text] measure to cope with the epistemic uncertainty of input data. Eventually, the practicality and capability of the proposed model are shown in a real-life case in Iran.

Historically, perineal RP has been described as the first surgical approach for the complete removal of the prostatic gland. In the past years, robotic techniques provided some technical advantages that allow resuming alternative approaches, such as robotic radical perineal prostatectomy (r-RPP). OBJECTIVE: To present in detail the technique of Xi nerve-sparing r-RPP and to report perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes from a European tertiary center. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostatic cancer not suitable for active surveillance and prostate volume up to 60 ml who underwent r-RPP between November 2018 and December 2020 were identified. SURGICAL PROCEDURE: All patients underwent Xi nerve-sparing r-RPP. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline characteristics and intraoperative, pathological, and postoperative data were collected and analyzed. The complications were reported according to the standardized methodology to report complications proposed by European Association of Urology guidelines. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, our series included 26 patients who underwent r-RPP. Patients median age was 62.5 yr. Thirteen (50%) and eight (30.7%) patients showed a body mass index (BMI) of 25C30 and >30, respectively. A history of past surgical procedures was present in seven (26.8%) patients. The median prostate volume was 40 (interquartile range [IQR]: 28C52) ml. The median operative time and blood lost were 246 (IQR: 230C268) min and 275 (IQR: 200C400) ml, respectively. Overall, four (15.4%) patients reported intraoperative complications and five (19.2%) reported postoperative complications, with one (3.8%) reporting major complications (Clavien-Dindo 3). No patient with biochemical recurrence (BCR) was reported at 1 yr of follow-up. Continence rates were 73.0%, 84.6%, and 92.3%, respectively, at 3, 6, and 12 mo after surgery. Erectile potency recovery rates were 57.1%, 66.6%, and 80.9% at 3, 6, and 12 mo of follow-up, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Xi r-RPP is a challenging but safe minimally invasive approach for selected patients. No patient reported BCR at 12 mo. The choice of the surgical approach for RP is likely to be based on the patients characteristics as well as the surgeons preferences. PATIENT SUMMARY: Our study suggests that Xi radical perineal prostatectomy is a safe minimally invasive approach for patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostatic cancer, and complex abdominal surgical history or comorbidities.","output":"Xi Nerve-sparing Robotic Radical Perineal Prostatectomy: European Single-center Technique and Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific conferences are integral to all fields of study, providing learners of all ages with opportunities to improve their practices, resulting in advancements that may benefit the greater population.

Vaccines are available to prevent contamination and to limit dissemination of these two coronaviruses, but efficient and widely affordable treatments are needed. Recently, four natural products targeting the 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) of PEDV and inhibiting replication of the virus in vitro have been identified: tomatidine, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, buddlejasaponin IVb and pneumocandin B0. We have evaluated the interaction of these compounds with 3CL(pro) of PEDV and with the structurally similar main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular docking analysis indicated that the echinocandin-type lipopeptide pneumocandin B0 can generate much more stable complexes with both proteases compared to tomatidine. The empirical energy of interaction (E) calculated with pneumocandin B0 bound to M(pro) is extremely high, comparable to that measured with known antiviral drugs. Pneumocandin B0 and its analogue capsofungin appeared a little less adapted to interact with 3CL(pro) compared to M(pro). In contrast, the antifungal drug micafungin bearing an unfused tricyclic side chain, emerges as a better ligand of 3CL(pro) of PEDV compared to M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2, based on our calculations.

There were no current guidelines or clear direction on the use of antivirals or other agents on treating Covid-19 for this new virus, and escalating death rates in the underserved community became disturbing. The early studies consisted of studying Chloroquine (CQ) or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without Azithromycin (AZ), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LV/RV) and other HIV Protease Inhibitors; Remdesivir (RDV) looked promising;however, it was still in clinical trial phases. COVID-19 causes individuals to suffer from respiratory distress, organ failure, hypotension, lactic acidosis, oliguria, and other acute blood disorders due to various pathogens and conditions. This massive infection triggers an immune response which vasoactivates chemicals, such as cytokines, dilate the blood vessels and increase capillary permeability, causing vascular fluid to shift to the interstitium. The immune system extends signaling molecules (cytokines) that recruit immune cells to the infection site as part of an inflammatory response. In a desperate attempt to save lives, Valtrex (VX) was used to treat COVID-19 as an off-label use to stop viral replication, stop inflammation, and promote recovery time for patients sent home with viral pneumonia due to COVID 19 that were Short of breath and who were symptomatic. VX is not without bothersome side-effects: it must be used with caution in persons with kidney disease and in people 60 years and older. To treat the pneumonia with a combination approach, amoxicillin (AMX) with clavulanate(CLV) was used twice a day for five days. In addition, Diflucan 150 mg was used to halt the overproduction of yeast caused by using antibiotics. Methods MEDLINE, PubMed, and print repositories on trials: for CQ HCQ with or without AZ, LV/RV, Protease Inhibitors, and RDV in COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection, until May 2020. The patients were given consent for off-label use of the treatment. The patients involved in the study were between the ages of 25 to 49. They had documented positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Radiologic studies were done as well as a complete blood count and a chemistry level. Results There were ten people treated with VX, AMX, and Diflucan((DFN). All the participants recovered. One participant had to receive supplemental oxygen and saline nebulizer treatments at home for one due to shortness of breath a month. The comparison group used high doses of probiotics 100 billion cells and ginger shots twice a day. The people who used VX, AMX, and DFN reported recovery from the symptoms of fever, coughing, and SOB in 24-48 hours. However, the patients that used the alternative medications reported symptom improvement around day 5 -7. In conclusion, there is an insufficient confirmation regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of VX in patients with COVID-19. Its use should be considered preliminary, requiring ethical approval and clinical trial oversight. VX can potentially be used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of Covid-19 that are sent home and asked to self-quarantine who are symptomatic but requires additional study.","output":"A case study on off-label medications vs alternative medicines in Patients with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been widely investigated for the treatment of COVID-19. Although it is rare, several case reports of acute toxicity of HCQ due to overdose have been reported during the last two decades. The aim of this review is to summarize the management options of acute HCQ toxicity. METHODS: A literature review that was conducted using an electronic search in the Google Scholar search engine. The inclusion criteria include any patient over 12 years old presenting with HCQ intoxication symptoms from January 1999 to January 2020. RESULTS: Sixteen cases were found that have the inclusion criteria of this study. Most patients presented with altered mental status, electrocardiogram abnormalities, visual disturbance, and decrease cardiac output. Activated charcoal was the first line of management in nearly two-thirds of patients whereas 93.8% received fluid resuscitation and 81.3% of the patients need at least one type of vasopressor agent. Furthermore, potassium is given for 93.8% of the patient while 75% of the patients need sodium bicarbonate and intubation, lipid emulsion was used in three patients only and 13 patients survived. CONCLUSION: The acute HCQ toxicity may result during the treatment period of COVID-19. The most common options can use in this situation include included gastric lavage and decontamination, IV fluid resuscitation, potassium replacement, sodium bicarbonate, intravenous lipid emulsion, and extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation.

Considering the importance of diagnosing COVID-19 and the need for reducing the number of false positive and false negative cases that appear to be different in various diagnostic methods, this systematic review aimed at comparison of PCR test accuracy with laboratory data and CT SCAN in COVID-19. Methods: In this systematic review, EMBASE (Elsevier, 2018), MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, 2018), Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, 2018b), and Google Scholar data bases were searched for the studies published prior to 3 April 2020. Based on the inclusion criteria, 20 out of 859 primarily screened studies were finally assessed. Results: The results indicated that the laboratory diagnosis of viral nucleic acid could have false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an option for diagnosis. Moreover, chest Computerized Tomography (CT) was found to be more sensitive in comparison to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) (98% vs. 71%). Hence, the articles offered the combined use of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and multiplex PCR. Conclusion: Follow-up RT-PCR and chest CT are necessary in COVID-19. In addition, serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies along with laboratory diagnosis of viral nucleic acid can lead to the highly sensitive and accurate diagnosis. Moreover, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is one of the cost-effective methods in epidemic conditions in low- and middle-income countries. ? 2021 Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

We address seasonal changes of microbial communities and DOM in the largest Croatian lake, Vrana. This shallow lake is connected to the Adriatic Sea and is impacted by agricultural activity. Microbial community and DOM structure were driven by several environmental stressors, including drought, seawater intrusion, and heavy precipitation events. Bacterial composition of different lifestyles (free-living and particle-associated) differed and only a part of the particle-associated bacteria correlated with microbial eukaryotes. Oscillations of cyanobacterial relative abundance along with chlorophyll a revealed a high primary production season characterized by increased levels of autochthonous DOM that promoted bacterial processes of organic matter degradation. From our results, we infer that in coastal freshwater lakes dependent on precipitation-evaporation balance, prolonged dry season coupled with heavy irrigation impact microbial communities at different trophic levels even if salinity increases only slightly and allochthonous DOM inputs decrease. These pressures, if applied more frequently or at higher concentrations, could have the potential to overturn the trophic state of the lake. This article is protected by copyright.

Two authors extracted data from included studies independently and conducted a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of 840 studies identified, 12 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. The incidence of yellow fever per 100,000 population ranged from < 1 case in Nigeria, < 3 cases in Uganda, 13 cases in Democratic Republic of the Congo, 27 cases in Kenya, 40 cases in Ethiopia, 46 cases in Gambia, 1267 cases in Senegal, and 10,350 cases in Ghana.

It is difficult to observe the amount of change observed in individuals and groups as most intergroup comparison studies only use mean values. To address these shortcomings, this study adopted a hierarchical linear model (HLM) in our trajectory analysis. Materials and Methods: We conducted neck stabilization training three times a week for four weeks in a single group of 21 stroke patients. To evaluate respiratory function, their forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced expiration ratio (FEV1/FVC), and peak cough flow (PCF) were measured. Data analysis was performed using HLM 8.0. Results: A significant increase was found in the respiratory function after neck stabilization training (p < 0.05). While neck stabilization training overall was longitudinally effective, the growth rate of respiratory function in left-sided paralytic patients was less than the whole group value. Conversely, the growth rate of respiratory function in right-sided paralytic patients was greater than the whole group value. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that neck stabilization training is longitudinally effective in improving respiratory function in stroke patients. Additionally, the growth rate of respiratory function was greater in patients with right side paralysis than in patients with left side paralysis.","output":"Neck Stabilization Exercises Enhance Respiratory Function after Stroke: Respiratory Function Index Change Trajectory Analyzed Using a Hierarchical Linear Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many organs, stem cell function depends on communication with their niche partners.

The first involves precise spatiotemporal endothelial-neuroblast cytoneme contacts and Dll4-Notch signaling to restrain neuroblast proliferation. The second, instead, requires blood flow to trigger a transcriptional response that modifies neuroblast metabolic status and induces sensory neuron differentiation. In contrast, no role of sensory neurogenesis in vascular development is found, suggesting unidirectional signaling from vasculature to sensory neuroblasts.

Challenges and failure of proper recruitment lead to early termination of trials. Monetary incentives have been suggested as a potential solution to these challenges. Therefore, we aimed to do a systematic review and analysis to evaluate the effect of incentives on the number of participants willing to consent to and participate in RCTs. METHODS Electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to September 23rd, 2021, using the following keywords: payments, incentive, response, participation, enrollment, randomized, randomization, and RCT. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the quality of the included trials. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). All analyses were done with the random-effects model. We used Revman software to perform the analysis. RESULTS Six RCTs with 6,253 Participants met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis showed significant improvement in response rate (RR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.55; P = 0.02) and consent rates (RR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.85; P = 0.006) when an incentive payment was offered to participants. Even a small amount of incentive showed significant improvement in both consent (RR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.73; P = 0.03) and response rates (RR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.47; P = 0.004). CONCLUSION In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrated statistically significant increases in the rate of consent and responses from participants when offered even small monetary value incentives. These findings suggest that incentives may be used to reduce the rate of recruitment failure and subsequent study termination. However, further RCTs are needed to establish a critical threshold beyond which incentive amount does not alter response rates further and the types of RCTs in which financial incentives are likely to be effective.","output":"The effectiveness of incentives for research participation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe the nursing interventions provided to patients with COVID-19 using the Nursing Interventions Classification.

This task becomes even more decisive when designers explore unconventional aircraft architectures or, in general, are still evaluating the fuselage design and its internal layout. In particular, it is of paramount importance to properly estimate the boarding and deboarding times, which contribute for up the 40% to the overall turnaround time. For this purpose, a tool, called SimBaD, has been developed and validated with publicly available data for existing aircraft of different classes. In order to demonstrate SimBaD capability of evaluating the influence of fuselage and cabin features on the turnaround time, its application to an unconventional box-wing aircraft architecture, known as PrandtlPlane, is presented as case study.

However, drug development for 3CLpro has been hindered by a lack of cell-based reporter assays that can be performed in a BSL-2 setting. Current efforts to identify 3CLpro inhibitors largely rely upon in vitro screening, which fails to account for cell permeability and cytotoxicity of compounds, or assays involving replication-competent virus, which must be performed in a BSL-3 facility. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel cell-based luciferase complementation reporter assay to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a BSL-2 setting. The assay is based on a lentiviral vector that co-expresses 3CLpro and two luciferase fragments linked together by a 3CLpro cleavage site. 3CLpro-mediated cleavage results in a loss of complementation and low luciferase activity, whereas inhibition of 3CLpro results in 10-fold higher levels of luciferase activity. The luciferase reporter assay can easily distinguish true 3CLpro inhibition from cytotoxicity, a powerful feature that should reduce false positives during screening. Using the assay, we screened 32 small molecules for activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, including HIV protease inhibitors, HCV protease inhibitors, and various other compounds that have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Of these, only five exhibited significant inhibition of 3CLpro in cells: GC376, boceprevir, Z-FA-FMK, calpain inhibitor XII, and GRL-0496.

METHODS: A total of 504 subjects, including 258 COVID-19 positives, and 246 healthy controls, were recruited. Genotyping of the ACE gene rs4646994, and AGT rs699, and AGTR1 rs5186 polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), respectively. RESULTS: Our results showed that the II genotype of ACE rs4646994 and the I allele decreased the risk of COVID-19 infection.

A critical step in the treatment and management of pulmonary fibrosis is the assessment of lung function decline, with computed tomography (CT) imaging being a particularly effective method for determining the extent of lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis. Motivated by this, we introduce Fibrosis-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis progression from chest CT images. More specifically, machine-driven design exploration was leveraged to determine a strong architectural design for CT lung analysis, upon which we build a customized network design tailored for predicting forced vital capacity (FVC) based on a patient's CT scan, initial spirometry measurement, and clinical metadata. Finally, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to study the decision-making behaviour of Fibrosis-Net as to verify that predictions are based on relevant visual indicators in CT images. Experiments using the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge benchmark dataset showed that the proposed Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the challenge leaderboard. Furthermore, explainability-driven performance validation demonstrated that the proposed Fibrosis-Net exhibits correct decision-making behaviour by leveraging clinically-relevant visual indicators in CT images when making predictions on pulmonary fibrosis progress.

The exponents are $2.48(20)$, $2.21(6)$ and $4.26(12)$ for the number of confirmed infections, deaths and cured cases, respectively, indicating an underlying small-world network structure in the pandemic. While no obvious deviations from the power-law growth can be seen yet for the number of deaths and cured cases, negative deviations have clearly appeared in the number of infections, particularly that for the region outside Hubei. This suggests the beginning of the slowing-down of the virus spreading due to the huge containment effort. Meanwhile, we find that despite the dramatic difference in magnitudes, the growth kinetics of the infection number exhibits much similarity for Hubei province and the region outside Hubei. On this basis, in log-log plot, we rescale the infection number for the region outside Hubei such that it overlaps as much as possible with the total infection number in China, from which an approximate extrapolation yields the maximum of the pandemic around March 3, 2020, with the number of infections about $83,000$.

Across studies, the total number of PCR-positive or antibody-positive participants at baseline was 615,777, and the maximum duration of follow-up was more than 10 months in three studies. Reinfection was an uncommon event (absolute rate 0%-1.1%), with no study reporting an increase in the risk of reinfection over time. Only one study estimated the population-level risk of reinfection based on whole genome sequencing in a subset of patients; the estimated risk was low (0.1% [95% CI: 0.08-0.11%]) with no evidence of waning immunity for up to 7 months following primary infection. These data suggest that naturally acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity does not wane for at least 10 months post-infection. However, the applicability of these studies to new variants or to vaccine-induced immunity remains uncertain.","output":"Quantifying the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically review the relationship between oral habits (bruxism- temporomandibular disorders) and COVID-19 pandemic in adults and adolescents.

The mechanism by which this can occur was investigated through in vitro translation studies using synthetic mRNAs containing the 3a, 3b, and 3c ORFs, and the results suggest that translation of the most distal of the three ORFs, that for 3c, is mediated by an unconventional, cap-independent mechanism involving internal initiation. This conclusion is based on several observations. A synthetic mRNA whose peculiar 5' end structure prevents translation of the 5'-proximal ORFs (3a and 3b) directs the synthesis of 3c normally. Translation of 3c, unlike that of 3a and 3b, was insensitive to the presence of the 5' cap analog 7-methyl-GTP, and it was unaffected by alteration of the sequence contexts for initiation on the 3a and 3b ORFs. Finally, an mRNA in which the 3a/b/c infectious bronchitis virus coding region was placed downstream of the influenza A virus nucleocapsid protein gene directed the efficient synthesis of 3c as well as nucleocapsid protein, whereas initiation at 3a and 3b could not be detected. Expression of the 3c ORF from this mRNA, however, was abolished when the 3a and 3b coding region was deleted, indicating that 3c initiation is dependent on upstream sequence elements which together may serve as a ribosomal internal entry site similar to those described for picornaviruses.","output":"Internal entry of ribosomes on a tricistronic mRNA encoded by infectious bronchitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus Covid-19 mutates quickly in the pandemic, leaves people struggling to verify and improve the effectiveness of the vaccine based on biochemistry.

The aim of this article is to determine what motivates night recreational runners and to analyse the differences between men and women according to age, and also to see whether the fact of having had COVID-19 or not matters when it comes to athletes motivation behind participating in runs. Runners were also asked about participating in cities or out-of-town events in terms of verifying the cleanliness of the air before running, using masks or running in green areas. 233 individuals in total participated in this descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study. The questionnaire uses the division of motives used in the Marathon Motivation Scale (MOMS) and a number of additional questions on environmental factors. Overall, the main motivation that drives night-time runners is health orientation, weight concern, personal goal achievement, psychological coping, life meaning and self-esteem. The research also showed higher scores for health orientation, recognition, psychological coping, life meaning and self-esteem among runners who had had COVID-19 than runners who had not had the virus. In addition, respondents clearly indicated that night running makes it easier to fall asleep and improves the quality of sleep. Most runners rated their mental health as being good, did not run in the morning despite better air levels, did not choose running events outside the urban area and did not check the air quality index before running. Therefore, it will be important for coaches, event organisers and other professionals to consider athletes age, gender, whether they have had COVID-19 and runners approaches to eco-attitudes when trying to understand their reasons for participating in different sports or leisure events, especially those that focus on a priority in shaping environmental attitudes. ? 2022 by the authors.

DESIGN: Observational. SETTING: Thirty-three Boston-area LTCFs over a 3-year period. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of long-term care who had previously participated in a trial of vitamin E supplementation and had paired serum samples available for viral analysis. MEASUREMENTS: Viral antibody titers to eight respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus serotype three (PIV-3), PIV-2, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and coronaviruses 229E and OC43) were measured using enzyme immunoassay at baseline and 53 weeks. Infection was defined as a more than quadrupling of viral titers. Clinical data on respiratory illnesses were collected throughout the study period. RESULTS: A total of 617 persons were enrolled in the trial. Of these, 382 (62%) had sera available for viral analysis. A total of 204 viral infections were documented in 157 subjects. Serological responses to all eight viruses were documented, with hMPV (12.8%) and coronavirus 229E (10.5%) being the most common and PIV-2 (2.4%) the least common.

In Italy, first line management of pediatric care is handed over to Primary Care Pediatricians (PCPs), who were not allowed to directly perform diagnostic tests during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Without a confirmatory diagnosis, PCPs could only collect information on ''COVID-19 like symptoms'' rather than identify typical COVID-19 symptoms. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 like symptoms in outpatient children, during Italian lockdown. To provide PCPs a risk score to be used in clinical practice during the differential diagnosis process. METHODS: A survey was submitted to 50 PCPs (assisting 47,500 children) from 7 different Italian regions between the 4th of March and the 23rd of May 2020 (total and partial lockdown period). COVID-19 like symptoms in the assisted children were recorded, as well as presence of confirmed/suspected cases in children's families, which was taken as proxy of COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression was accomplished to estimate the risk of having suspected/confirmed cases in families, considering symptoms as potential determinants. RESULTS: 2,300 children (4.8% of overall survey population) fell ill with COVID-19 like symptoms, 3.1% and 1.7% during total and partial lockdown period respectively. The concurrent presence of fatigue, cough, and diarrhea in children, in absence of sore throat/earache and abnormal skin signs, represents the maximum risk level of having a suspected/confirmed case of COVID-19 at home. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of children presenting COVID-19 like symptoms at home has been remarkable also during the total lockdown period. The present study identified a pattern of symptoms which could help, in a cost-effective perspective, PCPs in daily clinical practice to define priorities in addressing children to the proper diagnostic procedure.","output":"Children with COVID-19 like symptoms in Italian Pediatric Surgeries: the dark side of the coin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of oesophageal cancer, in particular adenocarcinoma, has markedly increased over the last four decades with adenocarcinoma becoming the dominant subtype in the West, and mortality rates are high.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the usability of multiplex PCR, especially in patients self-medicated with antibiotics, where bacterial cultures often give false-negative results. A cross-sectional study was developed in two COVID-19 units, where 489 eligible patients were included as antibiotic takers and non-antibiotic takers. Antibiotic takers used mostly over-the-counter medication; they suffered significantly more chronic respiratory conditions and were self-medicated most often with cephalosporins (41.4%), macrolide (23.2%), and penicillin (19.7%). The disease severity in these patients was significantly higher than in non-antibiotic takers, and bacterial superinfections were the most common finding in the same group (63.6%). Antibiotic takers had longer hospital and ICU admissions, although the mortality rate was not significantly higher than in non-antibiotic takers. The most common bacteria involved in secondary infections were Staphylococcus aureus (22.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27.8%), and Klebsiella spp (25.0%). Patients self-medicating with antibiotics had significantly higher rates of multidrug resistance. The multiplex PCR test was more accurate in identifying multidrug resistance and resulted in a quicker initiation of therapeutic antibiotics compared with instances where a bacterial culture was initially performed, with an average of 26.8 h vs. 40.4 h, respectively. The hospital stay was also significantly shorter by an average of 2.5 days when PCR was used as an initial assessment tool for secondary bacterial infections. When adjusted for age, COVID-19 severity, and pulmonary disease, over-the-counter use of antibiotics represented a significant independent risk factor for a prolonged hospitalization (AOR = 1.21). Similar findings were observed for smoking status (AOR = 1.44), bacterial superinfection (AOR = 1.52), performing only a conventional bacterial culture (AOR = 1.17), and a duration of more than 48 h for bacterial sampling from the time of hospital admission (AOR = 1.36). Multiplex PCR may be a very effective method for diagnosing secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 individuals self-medicating with antibiotics. Utilizing this strategy as an initial screen in COVID-19 patients who exhibit signs of sepsis and clinical deterioration will result in a faster recovery time and a shorter period of hospitalization.","output":"The Impact of Multiplex PCR in Diagnosing and Managing Bacterial Infections in COVID-19 Patients Self-Medicated with Antibiotics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews the current knowledges of congenital bleeding disorders (CBD) amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recently, local governments globally have begun to relax social distancing regulations. Using the situation in Manitoba, Canada as an example, we estimated the impact that social distancing relaxation may have on the pandemic. METHODS: We fit a mathematical model to empirically estimated numbers of people infected, recovered, and died from COVID-19 in Manitoba. We then explored the impact of social distancing relaxation on: (a) time until near elimination of COVID-19 (< one case per million), (b) time until peak prevalence, (c) proportion of the population infected within one year, (d) peak prevalence, and (e) deaths within one year. RESULTS: Assuming a closed population, near elimination of COVID-19 in Manitoba could have been achieved in 4C6 months (by July or August) if there were no relaxation of social distancing. Relaxing to 15% of pre-COVID effective contacts may extend the local epidemic for more than two years (median 2.1).

Only holding the course with respect to social distancing may have resulted in near elimination before Fall of 2020; relaxing social distancing to 15% of pre-COVID-19 contacts will flatten the epidemic curve but greatly extend the duration of the pandemic.","output":"Relaxation of social distancing restrictions: Model estimated impact on COVID-19 epidemic in Manitoba, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews available research literature in the field of lecturer self-efficacy beliefs produced between 1988 and 2020 Given the growing interest in lecturer self-efficacy beliefs in recent years, and the global challenges the Higher Education sector will face following the current Covid-19 pandemic, the time to conduct such a review seems appropriate Fifty-five empirical papers in English, Spanish and Portuguese were identified and examined Findings show that papers investigated the beliefs of lecturers from 23 countries using mostly quantitative cross-sectional approaches involving questionnaires Among the eight main themes that emerged, teaching self-efficacy featured prominently and received most attention, while other aspects of the work of lecturers, including research, service-related and other administrative activities, were also considered Concerning personal variables like gender, there was no consensus over whether different characteristics affected self-efficacy beliefs more than others Conclusions point to the need for additional mixed-methods and qualitative studies with more refined and contextualised methodological approaches to better understand the field, to identify actual sources of self-efficacy themselves and to more fully inform policy, practice, the distribution of resources and building capacity [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Further & Higher Education is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Lecturer self-efficacy beliefs: an integrative review and synthesis of relevant literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about the unprecedented expansion of highly sensitive molecular diagnostics as a primary infection control strategy. At the same time, many laboratories have shifted focus to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) research and diagnostic development, leading to large-scale production of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids that can interfere with these tests. We have identified multiple instances, in independent laboratories, in which nucleic acids generated in research settings are suspected to have caused researchers to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in surveillance testing. In some cases, the affected individuals did not work directly with these nucleic acids but were exposed via a contaminated surface or object. Though researchers have long been vigilant of DNA contaminants, the transfer of these contaminants to SARS-CoV-2 testing samples can result in anomalous test results. The impact of these incidents stretches into the public sphere, placing additional burdens on public health resources, placing affected researchers and their contacts in isolation and quarantine, removing them from the testing pool for 3 months, and carrying the potential to trigger shutdowns of classrooms and workplaces. We report our observations as a call for increased stewardship over nucleic acids with the potential to impact both the use and development of diagnostics. IMPORTANCE To meet the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, research laboratories shifted their focus and clinical diagnostic laboratories developed and utilized new assays. Nucleic acid-based testing became widespread and, for the first time, was used as a prophylactic measure. We report 15 cases of researchers at two institutes testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine surveillance tests, in the absence of any symptoms or transmission. These researchers were likely contaminated with nonhazardous nucleic acids generated in the laboratory in the course of developing new SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. These contaminating nucleic acids were persistent and widespread throughout the laboratory. We report these findings as a cautionary tale to those working with nucleic acids used in diagnostic testing and as a call for careful stewardship of diagnostically relevant molecules. Our conclusions are especially relevant as at-home COVID-19 testing gains traction in the marketplace and these amplicons may impact on the general public.","output":"Laboratory-Generated DNA Can Cause Anomalous Pathogen Diagnostic Test Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic brought about a reduction in surgical activity. The objective of this work was to analyze its impact on inguinal hernia morbidity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of cases and controls was carried out. Patients under 18 months of age undergoing inguinal hernia surgery from January 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020 were included. They were divided into two groups: patients undergoing surgery before (group A) or after (group D) the state of alarm was declared in Spain. Primary variables: episodes of incarceration and postoperative complications. Secondary variable: urgent or scheduled surgery. Demographic variables: sex, gestational age (GA), previous pathologies, age at diagnosis (AD), and age at surgery (AS) (months). RESULTS: 64 patients were included - 43 in group A and 21 in group D. In group A, median GA was 37+3, 90.5% of patients were male, median AD was 2.33, and median AS was 3.27. In group D, median GA was 31+2, 72.1% of patients were male, median AD was 3, and median AS was 3.63. There were no statistically significant differences. However, differences in terms of previous pathologies were significant (16.3% for Group A vs. 38.1% for group D) (p = 0.05). Regarding the primary variable, 25.6% of patients in group A had incarcerations vs. 33.3% of patients in group D (p = 0.51), whereas 9.3% of patients in group A had postoperative morbidity vs. 14.3% of patients in group D (p = 0.41). Regarding the secondary variable, 88.4% of surgeries in group A were scheduled vs. 90.5% of surgeries in group D (p = 0.583). CONCLUSION: In spite of reduced surgical activity, inguinal hernia morbidity did not surge in our environment. An increase in patients with previous pathologies was noted, which means severe patients should be prioritized.","output":"Pandemic's impact on inguinal hernia management in infants./ Impacto de la pandemia en el manejo de la hernia inguinal en lactantes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued several agency orders that put into effect a national moratorium on evictions for over one year to limit transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Little is known about landlord and tenant behaviors during the eviction moratorium. The current study used three waves of data from May 2020-April 2021 from a nationally representative sample of U.S. middle- and low-income tenants (n= 3,393 in Wave 1, n= 1,311 in Wave 2, and 814 in Wave 3) to examine tenants who were evicted during the eviction moratorium and the reported effects of the moratorium on tenant rental payments and tenant-landlord relationships. Across three Waves, 4.3% of tenants reported experiencing an eviction during the moratorium and 6-23% of tenants reported delaying paying rent because of the moratorium. Multivariable analyses found that tenants who delayed paying their rent, were female, or had a history of mental illness or substance use disorder were significantly more likely to report the eviction moratorium had a negative effect on the relationship with their landlord. Analyses also revealed that testing positive for COVID-19 was not a significant predictor of eviction but tenants with a history a homelessness were more than 9 times as likely to report an eviction than those without such a history. Together, these findings suggest the eviction moratorium has had some unintended consequences on rent payments and tenant-landlord relationships that need to be considered in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Predictors of eviction and quality of tenant-landlord relationships during the 2020-2021 eviction moratorium in the U.S."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This large nationwide population-based seroepidemiological study provides evidence on the effectiveness of physical distancing (>1.5m) and indoor group size reductions on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Taking daily cases and deaths data during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the U.S. as a case study, we develop a mobility-augmented geographically and temporally weighted regression (M-GTWR) model to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of social-demographic factors and human activities on the COVID-19 dynamics. Different from the base GTWR model, we incorporate a mobility-adjusted distance weight matrix where travel mobility is used in addition to the spatial adjacency to capture the correlations among local observations. The model residuals suggest that the proposed model achieves a substantial improvement over other benchmark methods in addressing the spatiotemporal nonstationarity. Our results reveal that the impacts of social-demographic and human activity variables present significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In particular, a 1% increase in population density may lead to 0.63% and 0.71% more daily cases and deaths, and a 1% increase in the mean commuting time may result in 0.22% and 0.95% increases in daily cases and deaths. Although increased human activities will, in general, intensify the disease outbreak, we report that the effects of grocery and pharmacy-related activities are insignificant in areas with high population density. And activities at the workplace and public transit are found to either increase or decrease the number of cases and deaths, depending on particular locations.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that the cholesterol-lowering agents, statins, are associated with reduced mortality in patients with various respiratory infections. We sought to investigate the relationship between statin use and COVID-19 disease severity in hospitalized patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020 was performed. The outcomes of interest were mortality and severe COVID-19 infection, as defined by prolonged hospital stay ( 7 days) and/ or invasive mechanical ventilation. Logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards regression and propensity score matching were used to obtain both univariable and multivariable associations between covariates and outcomes in addition to the average treatment effect of statin use. RESULTS: Of the 4,447 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 594 (13.4%) patients were exposed to statins on admission, of which 340 (57.2%) were male. The mean age was higher in statin users compared to non-users [64.9  13.4 vs. 45.5  16.6 years, p <0.001]. The average treatment effect of statin use on COVID-19-related mortality was RR = 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99C1.01, p = 0.928), while its effect on severe COVID-19 infection was RR = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.11C1.27, p <0.001).

Evaluating ICU care, and what is effective in improving outcomes for these patients is critical. Care bundles, a small set of evidence-based interventions, delivered together consistently, may improve patient outcomes. To identify the extent of the available evidence on the use of care bundles in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a scoping review to inform WHO guideline discussions. This review does not assess the effectiveness of the findings, assess risk of bias, or assess the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). As this review was commissioned to inform guideline discussions, it was done rapidly over a three-week period from 26 October to 18 November 2020. OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe the available evidence on the use of care bundles in the ICU for patients with COVID-19 or related conditions (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) viral pneumonia or pneumonitis), or both. In carrying out the review the focus was on characterising the evidence base and not evaluating the effectiveness or safety of the care bundles or their component parts. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 26 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies of all designs that reported on patients who are critically ill with COVID-19, ARDS, viral pneumonia or pneumonitis, in the ICU setting, where a care bundle was implemented in providing care, were eligible for inclusion. One review author (VS) screened all records on title and abstract. A second review author (DR) checked 20% of excluded and included records; agreement was 99.4% and 100% respectively on exclude/include decisions. Two review authors (VS and DR) independently screened all records at full-text level. VS and DR resolved any disagreements through discussion and consensus, or referral to a third review author (AN) as required. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author (VS) extracted the data and a second review author (DR) checked 20% of this for accuracy. As the review was not designed to synthesise effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterise the certainty of the evidence (GRADE), we mapped the extracted data and presented them in tabular format based on the patient condition; that is patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, patients with ARDS, patients with any influenza or viral pneumonia, patients with severe respiratory failure, and patients with mixed conditions. We have also provided a narrative summary of the findings from the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies and identified three ongoing studies. The studies were of variable designs and included a systematic review of standardised approaches to caring for critically ill patients in ICU, including but not exclusive to care bundles (1 study), a randomised trial (1 study), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (4 studies), before and after studies (7 studies), observational quality improvement reports (4 studies), case series/case reports (3 studies) and audit (1 study). The studies were conducted in eight countries, most commonly China (5 studies) and the USA (4 studies), were published between 1999 and 2020, and involved over 2000 participants in total. Studies categorised participant conditions patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (7 studies), patients with ARDS (7 studies), patients with another influenza or viral pneumonia (5 studies), patients with severe respiratory failure (1 study), and patients with mixed conditions (1 study). The care bundles described in the studies involved multiple diverse practices. Guidance on ventilator settings (10 studies), restrictive fluid management (8 studies), sedation (7 studies) and prone positioning (7 studies) were identified most frequently, while only one study mentioned chest X-ray. None of the included studies reported the prespecified outcomes ICU-acquired weakness (muscle wasting, weight loss) and users' experience adapting care bundles. Of the remaining prespecified outcomes, 14 studies reported death in ICU, nine reported days of ventilation (or ventilator-free days), nine reported length of stay in ICU in days, five reported death in hospital, three reported length of stay in hospital in days, and three reported adherence to the bundle. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review has identified 21 studies on care bundle use in critically ill patients in ICU with COVID-19, ARDS, viral influenza or pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. The data for patients with COVID-19 specifically are limited, derived mainly from observational quality improvement or clinical experiential accounts. Research is required, urgently, to further assess care bundle use and optimal components of these bundles in this patient cohort. The care bundles described were also varied, with guidance on ventilator settings described in 10 care bundles, while chest X-ray was part mentioned in one care bundle in one study only. None of the studies identified in this scoping review measured users' experience of adapting care bundles. Optimising care bundle implementation requires that the components of the care bundle are collectively and consistently applied. Data on challenges, barriers and facilitators to implementation are needed. A formal synthesis of the outcome data presented in this review and a critical appraisal of the evidence is required by a subsequent effectiveness review. This subsequent review should further explore effect estimates across the included studies.","output":"Care bundles for improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19 or related conditions in intensive care - a rapid scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Le monde entier est touch par un bouleversement sans prcdent, cre par un virus incontr?lable et qui a pris le pas sur les thories scientifiques les plus labores.

Our goal was to report our experience with the replacement and implementation of linear accelerators with radiosurgery capabilities at SOLCA hospital in Quito, Ecuador and give some recommendations for future Technological replacements (TRs). Methods Two surveys were performed in SOLCAs radiosurgery department, one before the TR was finalized and one after, consisting of an open and multiple-choice questionnaire. Questions focused on the performance of the new equipment, perceptions regarding the training, and the influence of the pandemic on the whole process. Additionally, we share our experience regarding the difficulties and benefits of TR at SOLCA. Results The most reported limitation was lack of training (48%). By the time of the second survey, 95.2% of the staff had already treated patients or planned a radio-surgical procedure;42.9% considered training to have been adequate, and 76.2% felt that the pandemic hindered the training process. Currently, 33 radiosurgeries have been done (26 for the central nervous system and 7 stereotactic radiation body therapies). Conclusion The TR in SOLCA had similarities with other experiences in LMIC, but the pandemic brought additional limitations, mainly complicating the staff training. Nevertheless, those limitations can be resolved with a structured training program and international collaboration. Overall, the benefits obtained from a TR result in exponentially better medical care and accessibility to novel treatments.","output":"Technological improvements in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC): A review of the literature and the SOLCA institutional experience in Neuro-Radiosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pro-active emerging risk identification system starts with the selection of critical factors related to the occurrence of emerging hazards.

The aims of this study included: measurement of adhesion formation with Dynamesh IPOM after laparoscopic intraperitoneal implantation, and assessment of the occurrence of isolated adhesions at the fastening sites of slowly absorbable sutures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve healthy pigs underwent laparoscopic implantation of 2 Dynamesh IPOM mesh fragments each, one was fastened with PDSII, and the other with Maxon sutures. An assessment of adhesion formation was carried out after 6 weeks and included an evaluation of surface area, hardness according to the Zhulke scale, and index values. The occurrence of isolated adhesions at slowly absorbable suture fixation points was also analyzed. RESULTS Adhesions were noted in 83.3% of Dynamesh IPOM meshes. Adhesions covered on average 37.7% of the mesh surface with mean hardness 1.46 and index value 78.8. In groups fixed with PDS in comparison to Maxon sutures adhesions covered mean 31.6% vs. 42.5% (p = 0.62) of the mesh surface, mean hardness was 1.67 vs.1.25 (p = 0.34) and index 85.42 vs. 72.02 (p = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS The Dynamesh IPOM mesh, in spite of its anti-adhesive layer of PVDF, does not prevent the formation of adhesions.

Purpose The aim of this observational cohort study was to describe characteristics and management of the patients hospitalized for pericarditis secondary to COVID 19 in the Hospital of Haguenau, France. Methods We retrospectively enrolled patients admitted for pericarditis secondary to COVID 19 affection, either confirmed by a typical chest CT scan, or a positive Covid 19 PCR. Data were collected by a careful review of their medical record. Results 7 patients (4 men, 3 women) were included, with a median age of 60 and a median body mass index of 27.8 kg/m2. One of them took angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and none angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Chest pain and dyspnea were the most common initial symptoms. Pericarditis were diagnosed with a median delay of 21 days after the onset of symptoms. The biology showed an inflammatory syndrome (median CRP at 104mg/L). The troponin peak value was increased in two cases. Chest computed tomography revealed a typical lung COVID-19 affection in 4 cases and a pericardial effusion in every cases. Left ventricle ejection fraction assessed by echocardiography was normal. Two cases evolved into cardiac tamponade, which needed pericardiocentesis. One of the two cases of tamponade had a negative COVID 19 nasopharyngeal PCR and no pulmonary sign of the affection on the chest CT, but the Covid-19 PCR on pericardial fluid was positive. One patient required oxygen supply. Treatment with Colchicine was systematically initiated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not introduced considering the risk of respiratory worsening.

Exacerbated production of cytokines, mainly IL-6, points to macrophages as key to understand differential COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 may modulate macrophage-mediated inflammation events by altering the balance between angiotensin II, which activates angiotensin receptor types 1 and 2, and angiotensin 1-7 and alamandine, which activate MAS proto-oncogene and MAS-related D receptors, respectively. In addition to macrophages, lung cells express RAS components; also, some lung cells are able to produce IL-6. Addressing how SARS-CoV-2 unbalances RAS functionality via ACE2 will help design therapies to attenuate a COVID-19-related cytokine storm.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 as a Factor to Disbalance the Renin-Angiotensin System: A Suspect in the Case of Exacerbated IL-6 Production."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present paper discusses different methods to stop COVID-19 pandemic which bring the whole of world to a stand-still The (COVID-19) Coronavirus Disease- 19 caused by (SARS-CoV-2) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection which recently emerged in Wuhan province of China and has rapidly spread throughout the World The information regarding its intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is still unknown or very less known, but its fast transmission from human to human has been confirmed widely Till date no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine has been developed against COVID-19 In the present paper, authors tries to summarize and comparatively analyse the deadly virus author also discuss that how this virus poses a constant threat to sub continental nations especially India The present paper also suggests number of ecological interventions to protect humans","output":"COVID-19: bat-borne viral outbreaks and its prevention through ecological intervention with reference to India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak combined with social distancing, isolation, and movement restrictions has had a profound impact on individuals physical and psychological well-being. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of depression and anxiety with feelings of stigma among patients in Saudi Arabia who have recovered from COVID-19. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and December 2020. Trained healthcare providers contacted and interviewed participants by phone. Depression, anxiety, and stigma were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue stigma scale (EMIC). Data on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and family history of mental illness were also collected. Multiple linear regression models were performed to explore factors associated with depression and anxiety. Results A total of 174 adult participants (18 years old) who had recently recovered from COVID-19 were interviewed. The mean PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were 7.53 (5.04) and 3.77 (4.47), respectively. About 68% of the participants had at least mild depression (PHQ-9 score of 5C9), whereas only 29.89% had at least mild anxiety (GAD-7 score of 5C9) during their infections with COVID-19. Multiple linear regression showed that females were more vulnerable to depression and anxiety disorders than their male counterparts were (=3.071 and =1.86, respectively). Notably, participants stigma scores were significantly associated with higher scores on depression and anxiety. Conclusion These findings highlight the negative consequences of COVID-19 infection on the mental health of recovered patients. Therefore, considerable attention from local and international health authorities is needed to improve the mental well-being of recovered COVID-19 patients.","output":"Associations of Depression and Anxiety with Stigma in a Sample of Patients in Saudi Arabia Who Recovered from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an enveloped RNA virus that is diversely found in humans and wildlife A total of six species have been identified to cause disease in humans They are known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems The past few decades have seen endemic outbreaks in the form of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Yet again, we see the emergence of another outbreak due to a new strain called the SARS-CoV-2 virus The most recent outbreak initially presented as pneumonia of unknown etiology in a cluster of patients in Wuhan, China The epicenter of infection was linked to seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets in the city SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has resulted in a rapid pandemic of COVID-19 As the number of cases continues to rise, it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health This review will introduce a general overview of coronavirus and describe the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients It will also provide a means to raise awareness among primary and secondary healthcare providers during the current pandemic Furthermore, our review focuses on the most up-to-date clinical information for the effective management, prevention, and counseling of patients worldwide FAU - Hassan, Syed Adeel","output":"Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Review of Clinical Features, Diagnosis, and Treatment.

METHODS Tissue sections of carotid endarterectomy tissue were characterized as early plaque, fibro-calcific plaque, or phenotypically vulnerable plaque. In vitro binding assays for the radioligands [111In]In-DOTATATE; [111In]In-DOTA-JR11; [67Ga]Ga-Pentixafor; [111In]In-DANBIRT; and [111In]In-EC0800 were conducted, the expression of the radioligand targets was assessed via immunohistochemistry. Radioligand binding and expression of radioligand targets was investigated and compared. RESULTS In sections characterized as vulnerable plaque, binding was highest for [111In]In-EC0800; followed by [111In]In-DANBIRT; [67Ga]Ga-Pentixafor; [111In]In-DOTA-JR11; and [111In]In-DOTATATE (0.064  0.036; 0.052  0.029; 0.011  0.003; 0.0066  0.0021; 0.00064  0.00014 %Added activity/mm2, respectively). Binding of [111In]In-DANBIRT and [111In]In-EC0800 was highest across plaque phenotypes, binding of [111In]In-DOTA-JR11 and [67Ga]Ga-Pentixafor differed most between plaque phenotypes.

The areas positive for cells expressing the radioligand's target differed between plaque phenotypes for all targets, with lowest percentage area of expression in early plaque sections and highest in phenotypically vulnerable plaque sections. CONCLUSIONS Radioligands targeting inflammatory cell markers showed different levels of binding in atherosclerotic plaques and among plaque phenotypes. Different radioligands might be used for plaque detection and discerning early from vulnerable plaque. [111In]In-EC0800 and [111In]In-DANBIRT appear most suitable for plaque detection, while [67Ga]Ga-Pentixafor and [111In]In-DOTA-JR11 might be best suited for differentiation between plaque phenotypes.","output":"Autoradiographical assessment of inflammation-targeting radioligands for atherosclerosis imaging: potential for plaque phenotype identification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza poses a significant public health and economic burden, associated with the outcome of infection and resulting complications. The true burden of the disease is difficult to capture due to the wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic cases to non-respiratory complications such as cardiovascular events, and its seasonal variability. An understanding of the magnitude of the true annual incidence of influenza is important to support prevention and control policy development and to evaluate the impact of preventative measures such as vaccination. METHODS: We use a dynamic disease transmission model, laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data, and randomized-controlled trial (RCT) data to quantify the underestimation factor, expansion factor, and symptomatic influenza illnesses in the US and Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. RESULTS: Based on 2 case definitions, we estimate between 0.42?3.2% and 0.33?1.2% of symptomatic influenza illnesses were laboratory-confirmed in Canada during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, respectively. In the US, we estimate between 0.08?0.61% and 0.07?0.33% of symptomatic influenza illnesses were laboratory-confirmed in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, respectively. We estimated the symptomatic influenza illnesses in Canada to be 0.32?2.4 million in 2011-2012 and 1.8?8.2 million in 2012-2013. In the US, we estimate the number of symptomatic influenza illnesses to be 4.4?34 million in 2011-2012 and 23?102 million in 2012-2013.

The purpose of this study was to assess levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of healthcare employees working in hospitals and their use of formal and informal mental health supports. Data was gathered over a three-week period in December 2020 as COVID cases began to rise sharply in Ontario, Canada. Results from an online survey of 650 healthcare employees suggested that overall levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were mild. However, a significant minority of participants reported severe or extremely severe levels of depression (14.4%), anxiety (21.8%), and stress (13.5%). Levels of distress were higher among women, younger participants, those who did not work directly with COVID+ patients, and those who were redeployed. Use of formal mental health supports (e.g., Employee Assistance Plans, teletherapy) was very low (<10%), with the most frequently-reported reason for not using supports being problems not severe enough to require this service. Implications are considered for healthcare policy decisions as hospital systems attempt to address the mental health needs of their employees.","output":"My problems aren't severe enough to seek help: Stress levels and use of mental health supports by Canadian hospital employees during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for treatment. Despite multiple clinical trials using different agents, there is still a lack of specific treatment for COVID-19. Having the potential role in suppressing inflammation, immune modulation, antiviral and improving respiratory symptoms, this review discusses the potential role of methylxanthine drugs like pentoxifylline and caffeine in the management of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 pathogenesis for clinical features like severe pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) / acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failures are excessive inflammation, oxidation, and cytokine storm by the exaggerated immune response. Drugs like pentoxifylline have already shown improvement of the symptoms of ARDS and caffeine has been in clinical use for decades to treat apnea of prematurity (AOP) in preterm infants and improve respiratory function. Pentoxifylline is well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecules that have already shown to suppress Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-&#945;) as well as other inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary diseases, and this may be beneficial for better clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pentoxifylline enhances blood flow, improves microcirculation and tissue oxygenation, and caffeine also efficiently improves tissue oxygenation, asthma, decreases pulmonary hypertension and an effective analgesic. There are significant shreds of evidence that proved the properties of pentoxifylline and caffeine against virus-related diseases as well. Along with the aforementioned evidences and high safety profiles, both pentoxifylline and caffeine offer a glimpse of considerations for future use as a potential adjuvant to COVID-19 treatment.

Remdesivir (RDV [VEKLURY]) is a nucleoside analog prodrug and the first FDA-approved antiviral treatment of COVID-19. Here, we present a comprehensive antiviral activity assessment of RDV and its parent nucleoside, GS-441524, against 10 current and former SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOI clinical isolates by nucleoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and plaque reduction assay. Delta and Omicron variants remained susceptible to RDV and GS-441524, with 50% effective concentration (EC50) values 0.30- to 0.62-fold of those observed against the ancestral WA1 isolate. All other tested variants exhibited EC50 values ranging from 0.13- to 2.3-fold of the observed EC50 values against WA1. Analysis of nearly 6 million publicly available variant isolate sequences confirmed that Nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) target of RDV and GS-441524, is highly conserved across variants, with only 2 prevalent changes (P323L and G671S). Using recombinant viruses, both RDV and GS-441524 retained potency against all viruses containing frequent variant substitutions or their combination.

While diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is recognized to be the primary manifestation COVID-19 pneumonia, there has been little emphasis on the progression to the fibrosing phase of DAD. This topic is of great interest due to growing concerns regarding the potential long-term complications in prolonged survivors. METHODS Here we report a detailed histopathologic study of thirty autopsy cases with COVID-19 virus infection, based on minimally invasive autopsies performed between February to March, 2020. RESULTS The mean age was 69 years, with twenty (67%) males and 10 (33%) females and frequent (70.0%) underlying comorbidities. The duration of illness ranged from 16 to 82 (median=42) days. Histologically, the most common manifestation was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 28 (93.3%) cases which showed predominantly acute (32%), organizing (25%), and/or fibrosing (43%) patterns. Patients with fibrosing DAD were one decade younger (p=0.034) and they had a longer duration of illness (p=0.033), hospitalization (p=0.037) and mechanical ventilation (p=0.014) compared to those with acute DAD. Patients with organizing DAD had a longer duration of illness (p=0.032) and hospitalization (p=0.023) compared to those with acute DAD.

The overall low homology to ICV, lack of antibody cross-reactivity to ICV in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion assays, and inability to productively reassort with ICV led to the proposal that these viruses represented a new genus of influenza virus, influenzavirus D (IDV). To further our understanding of the epidemiology of IDV, real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed on a set of 208 samples from bovines with respiratory disease. Ten samples (4.8%) were positive and six viruses were successfully isolated in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of full-genome sequences of these six new viruses and four previously reported viruses revealed two distinct cocirculating lineages represented by D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) and D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (D/660), which frequently reassorted with one another. Antigenic analysis using the HI assay and lineage-representative D/OK and D/660 antiserum found up to an approximate 10-fold loss in cross-reactivity against heterologous clade antiserum. One isolate, D/bovine/Texas/3-13/2011 (D/3-13), clustered with the D/660 lineage, but also had high HI titers to heterologous (D/OK) clade antiserum. Molecular modeling of the hemagglutinin esterase fusion protein of D/3-13 identified a mutation at position 212 as a possible antigenic determinant responsible for the discrepant HI results. These results suggest that IDV is common in bovines with respiratory disease and that at least two genetic and antigenically distinct clades cocirculate. IMPORTANCE A novel bovine influenza virus was recently identified. Detailed genetic and antigenic studies led to the proposal that this virus represents a new genus of influenza, influenzavirus D (IDV). Here, we show that IDV is common in clinical samples of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), with a prevalence similar to that of other established BRDC etiological agents. These results are in good agreement with the near-ubiquitous seroprevalence of IDV previously found. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences found evidence for two distinct cocirculating lineages of IDV which freely reassort. Significant antigenic differences, which generally agreed with the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin esterase phylogeny, were observed between the two lineages. Based on these results, and on the ability of IDV to infect and transmit in multiple mammalian species, additional studies to determine the pathogenic potential of IDV are warranted.","output":"Cocirculation of two distinct genetic and antigenic lineages of proposed influenza D virus in cattle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is lacking. AIMS This study investigates the relationship between COVID-19 and behaviors of children with ASD living in the United States. METHODS AND PROCEDURES Parents and caregivers (n = 200) across the United States, as proxies for children 2-17 years of age with ASD, participated in an online survey querying changes in overall behavior and 15 specific behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of a moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior with household income level and food security status. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS A majority of respondents reported a moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior (74 %) due to COVID-19. Several specific behaviors were also affected. Stratifying by income level and food security status revealed disparities in the impact on overall behavior and most specific behaviors. Compared to a household income $100 K, an income <$50 K was associated with an increased risk of moderate-to-large impact on the child's overall behavior (odds ratio (OR): 4.07, 95 % CI: 1.60, 10.38). Food insecurity also significantly impacted this risk, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR: 3.31, 95 % CI: 1.13, 9.66).

In order to control the transmission, the coefficient of nonlinear incidence function is adopted as the Governmental control input. To adequately understand the COVID-19 dynamics, bifurcation analysis is performed and the effect of varying reproduction number on the COVID-19 transmission is studied. The inadequacy of an open-loop approach in controlling the disease spread is validated via numerical simulations and a robust closed-loop control methodology using sliding mode control is also presented. The proposed SMC strategy could bring the basic reproduction number closer to 1 from an initial value of 2.5, thus limiting the exposed and infected individuals to a controllable threshold value.

A full BPMN pattern is proposed encompassing the happy flow, the declinations, the rejections and the revocations, without adding any new element to the BPMN specification. A software tool has been developed, and made publicly available, to support the automatic generation of the BPMN models from the proposed patterns. Our semantified BPMN pattern allowed the identification of a large amount of implicit, and other not implemented, situations in both proof-of-concepts. It is concluded that the usage of a semantic solution, grounded on a sound pattern, allows the systematic enrichment of the BPMN models with a bounded effort. Moreover, to simplify the BPMN executable models' implementation, its elements could be classified as implicit, explicit, or not implemented yet. Finally, related work indicates that this work is demanded, but no full solutions are available.","output":"A framework to semantify BPMN models using DEMO business transaction pattern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic occurred in the context of a dramatic decline in support for biological and health research in France.

The crisis management mechanisms in place before the global financial crisis (the International Monetary Fund and international reserves) were overwhelmed by it.

Dumfries and Galloway (D&G) has seen fewer hospitalised cases than predicted. We wondered whether this might be related at least in part to population density. Methods We compared Covid-19 hospitalisation rates/100,000 population in D&G with those of the other 10 mainland Scottish health boards. We chose two time points: 19th April which was the peak of the pandemic in Scotland and 15th May, seven and a half weeks after lockdown. We used chi square and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to test for differences in hospitalisation rates and Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the relation between hospitalisation rates and population density. Population density for each health board was provided by National Records of Scotland. Results Hospitalisation in D&G was 13.4/100,000 on 19th April, falling to 1.3/100,000 by 15th May. Corresponding hospitalisation rates in Greater Glasgow & Clyde (GGC) were 50.1/100,000 and 38.9/100,000. Compared to GGC, hospitalisation rates in D&G were 3 times lower at peak (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17, 0.42) and 30 times lower by 15th May (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01, 0.14). Hospitalisation rates for the other health boards lay in between values recorded for D&G and GGC and fell in 10 of the 11 boards between these two dates. There was a positive association between hospitalisation rate and population density (r=0.756, p=0.007 on 19th April and r=0.840, p<0.001 for 15th May). Conclusion We have confirmed there are large differences in Covid-19 hospitalisation rates across the 11 mainland Scottish health boards, that are in part related to population density.

Low trust in vaccines is attributed to a combination of factors, including lack of understanding, vaccine scares, flawed policies, social media and mistrust of vaccine manufacturers, scientists and decision-makers. The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare societies' vulnerability to new pathogens and the critical role of vaccines (and their acceptability) in containing this and future pandemics. It has also put science at the forefront of the response, with several governments relying on academics to help shape policy and communicate with the public. Against this backdrop, protecting public trust in scientists and scientific output is arguably more important than ever. Yet, conflicts of interest (CoI) in biomedical research remain ubiquitous and harmful, and measures to curb them have had limited success. There is also evidence of bias in industry-sponsored vaccine studies and academics are voicing concerns about the risks of working in a CoI prevalent research area. Here, we set out to challenge established thinking with regard to vaccine confidence, by shifting the gaze from a deficit in public understanding towards probity in research relationships and suggesting an alternative and perhaps complementary strategy for addressing vaccine mistrust. We argue that a concerted effort needs to be made to revisit the norms that undergird contemporary vaccine research, coupled with a willingness of all stakeholders to reimagine those relationships with an emphasis on demonstrating trustworthiness and probity.","output":"Vaccine confidence, public understanding and probity: time for a shift in focus?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a potential agent to treat patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The objective of this article is to compare the expected benefit (EB) of two screening strategies, one with rapid tests (SwRT) and another one without rapid tests (Sw RT). Methods : We performed a decision analysis, with the overall EB defined as the proportion of correctly identified individuals minus the proportion of incorrectly identified individuals. Accordingly, the SwRT strategy will be deemed a better screening strategy if its lesser EB for COVID-19 free individuals is more than compensated by its greater EB for COVID-19 individuals. Otherwise, it will not. Results : As expected, the EB for COVID-19 individuals was greater for the SwRT strategy, with a far superior ability to rule out the presence of COVID-19. In fact, under the scenario of interest (i.e., 8000 ID Now rapid tests in addition to 28185 lab-based RT-PCR tests), it identified almost 16% more COVID-19 individuals than the Sw RT strategy. In addition, the EB for COVID-19 free individuals was the same for both strategies, with a perfect ability at ruling in the presence of COVID-19. Conclusion : The SwRT strategy identified more COVID-19 individuals and this gain was not obtained at the detriment of COVID-19 free individuals who were equally well identified by both strategies. Hence, the SwRT strategy is a better screening strategy for COVID-19. It represents an opportunity to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that we may not afford to miss with new more contagious variants becoming more and more common in Canada.","output":"Using rapid (point-of-care) tests for COVID-19: A decision analysis comparing the expected benefit of two screening strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current COVID\\\\19 scenario, there is an urgent need for developing efficient and mercury\\\\free deep\\\\ultraviolet (deep\\\\UV) light sources for disinfection applications.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the influence of time pressure on the emotional exhaustion of front-line healthcare workers, and explore the effects of social sharing and cognitive reappraisal on this. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020. A total of 232 questionnaires were completed by front-line healthcare workers in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Hierarchical linear regression and conditional process analysis were performed to explore the relationships among time pressure, social sharing, cognitive reappraisal, and emotional exhaustion. RESULTS: Time pressure was positively associated with social sharing and emotional exhaustion. Social sharing presented the dark side, a negative effect that was always kept concealed, in terms of the impact on emotional exhaustion. Cognitive reappraisal negatively moderated the relationship between time pressure and social sharing, and it further indirectly influenced the relationship between time pressure and emotional exhaustion through social sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on how time pressure influences the emotional exhaustion of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 period. Although social sharing is commonly regarded as a positive behavior, we identified a dark side in terms of its impact. We also identified that improving cognitive reappraisal may present a positive strategy toward alleviating emotional exhaustion.","output":"Emotional exhaustion in front-line healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China: the effects of time pressure, social sharing and cognitive appraisal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SNOMED CT fosters interoperability in healthcare and research.

In this study, we analyzed the cargo of EVs isolated from the plasma of patients with COVID-19 for the identifiction of potential biomarkers of disease severity and to explore their role in disease pathogenesis. Plasma-derived EVs were isolated from 53 hospitalized patients with COVID infection and compared according to the severity of the disease. Analysis of inflammatory and cardiovascular protein cargo of large EVs revealed significantly differentially expressed proteins for each disease sub-group. Notably, members of the TNF superfamily and IL-6 family were up-regulated in patients on oxygen support with severe and moderate disease. EVs from the severe group were also enhanced with pro-thrombotic/endothelial injury factors (TF, t-PA, vWF) and proteins associated with cardiovascular pathology (MB, PRSS8, REN, HGF). Significantly higher levels of TF, CD163, and EN-RAGE were observed in EVs from severe patients when compared to patients with a moderate disease requiring supplemental O(2). Importantly, we also observed increased caspase 3/7 activity and decreased cell survival in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells exposed to EVs from the plasma of patients with severe disease compared to asymptomatic group.

The pandemic is historic in scope and precedent given its emergence in an increasingly digital era. Importantly, there have been concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 case counts due to issues such as lack of access to testing and difficulty in measuring recoveries. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to detect and characterize user-generated conversations that could be associated with COVID-19-related symptoms, experiences with access to testing, and mentions of disease recovery using an unsupervised machine learning approach. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public streaming application programming interface from March 3-20, 2020, filtered for general COVID-19-related keywords and then further filtered for terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms as self-reported by users. Tweets were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model (BTM), where groups of tweets containing the same word-related themes were separated into topic clusters that included conversations about symptoms, testing, and recovery. Tweets in these clusters were then extracted and manually annotated for content analysis and assessed for their statistical and geographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,492,954 tweets were collected that contained terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms. After using BTM to identify relevant topic clusters and removing duplicate tweets, we identified a total of 3465 (<1%) tweets that included user-generated conversations about experiences that users associated with possible COVID-19 symptoms and other disease experiences. These tweets were grouped into five main categories including first- and secondhand reports of symptoms, symptom reporting concurrent with lack of testing, discussion of recovery, confirmation of negative COVID-19 diagnosis after receiving testing, and users recalling symptoms and questioning whether they might have been previously infected with COVID-19. The co-occurrence of tweets for these themes was statistically significant for users reporting symptoms with a lack of testing and with a discussion of recovery. A total of 63% (n=1112) of the geotagged tweets were located in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This study used unsupervised machine learning for the purposes of characterizing self-reporting of symptoms, experiences with testing, and mentions of recovery related to COVID-19. Many users reported symptoms they thought were related to COVID-19, but they were not able to get tested to confirm their concerns. In the absence of testing availability and confirmation, accurate case estimations for this period of the outbreak may never be known.

METHODS: Descriptive and analytical observational retrospective study of all emergency consultations between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020, carried out by the OtorhinolaryngologyCHead and Neck Surgery Department of a tertiary university hospital. The adequacy of consultations was assessed with the Hospital Emergency Suitability Protocol (HESP). The correlation between the emergencies and the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases was assessed with a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Although there was a decrease of almost 50% in ENT-ED visits during the first wave of COVID-19, the pattern of most cases remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 era: non-urgent consultations, not previously assessed by Primary Care (PC), being considered inadequate by the HESP. The three main reasons for consultation were otalgia, odynophagia, and epistaxis. The number of ENT-ED visits and the total number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the health area were correlated. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was a challenge for the Spanish health system. The critical epidemiological situation experienced during March, April, and May explains the reduction in the number of visits to the ENT-ED.

With many countries easing or beginning to lift these measures to restart activities presently, concern is growing regarding the impacts that such reopening of societies could have on the subsequent transmission of the virus. While mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission have played important roles in evaluating the general population-level impacts of these measures for curbing virus transmission, a key need is for models that are able to effectively capture the effects of the spatial and social heterogeneities that drive the epidemic dynamics observed at the local community level. Iterative near-term forecasting that uses new incoming epidemiological and social behavioural data to sequentially update locally-applicable transmission models can overcome this gap, potentially leading to better predictions and intervention actions. Here, we present the development of one such data-driven iterative modelling tool based on publically-available data and an extended SEIR model for forecasting SARS-CoV-2 at the county level in the United States, and demonstrate, using data from the state of Florida, how this tool can be used to explore the outcomes of the social measures proposed for containing the course of the pandemic as a result of easing the initially imposed lockdown in the state. We provide comprehensive results showing the use of the locally identified models for accessing the impacts and societal tradeoffs of using specific strategies involving movement restriction, social distancing and mass testing, and conclude that while it is absolutely vital to continue with these measures over the near-term and likely to the end of March 2021 in all counties for containing the ongoing pandemic before less socially-disruptive vaccination strategies come into play, it could be possible to lift the more disruptive movement restriction/social distancing measures by end of December 2020 if these are accompanied by widespread testing and contact tracing. Our findings further show that such intensified social interventions could potentially also bring about the control of the epidemic in low and some medium incidence counties first, supporting the development and deployment of a geographically-phased approach to reopening the economy of Florida. We have made our data-driven forecasting system publicly available for policymakers and health officials to use in their own locales, with the hope that a more efficient coordinated strategy for controlling SARS-CoV-2 state-wide, based on effective control of viral transmission at the county level, can be developed and successfully implemented.","output":"Iterative near-term forecasting of the transmission and management of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 using social interventions at the county-level in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-replicating RNA derived from the genomes of positive strand RNA viruses represents a powerful tool for both molecular studies on virus biology and approaches to novel safe and effective vaccines.

Social media is increasingly used to share news and opinions about it. A realistic assessment of the situation is necessary to utilize resources optimally and appropriately. In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the TextBlob library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F(1) score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The LSTM achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the GloVe feature extraction approach.","output":"A performance comparison of supervised machine learning models for Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Masks play a role in the protection of health-care workers (HCWs) from acquiring respiratory infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in health-care settings.

The impact of prenatal opioid exposure on these neonates remains a public health and research priority due to both its short and long-term effects on offspring. Among the adverse long-term effects associated with OUD is a metabolic syndrome with accompanying cardiovascular comorbidities. The susceptibility to metabolic diseases may begin as early as conception. Neonates born in a setting of prenatal opioid exposure are known to have aberrant early growth, e.g., lower birth weight and smaller head size, and dysregulated feeding behavior that ranges from feeding difficulty to hyperphagia which may predispose these neonates to metabolic syndrome in adulthood. However, studies on this topic are lacking. In this article, we describe the reported association between OUD and metabolic syndrome in adults, animal data linking opioid receptors with the development of diet-induced obesity, the inflammatory modulation of opioids and finally, neonatal salivary transcriptomic data from our laboratory that highlighted the sex-specific impact of opioids on the hypothalamic and reward receptors that regulate feeding behavior in opioid-exposed neonates. There is a great need for future research linking opioids with epigenetic and gene expression changes, as well as neuromodulatory effects in the developing brain, that may underlie the dysregulated feeding, growth, and long-term metabolic and cardiovascular risks for these neonates.","output":"Aberrant Feeding and Growth in Neonates With Prenatal Opioid Exposure: Evidence of Neuromodulation and Behavioral Changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing measures have emerged as the predominant intervention for containing the spread of COVID-19, but evaluating adherence and effectiveness remains a challenge.

However, the curve of COVID-19 positive cases has not significantly flattened yet, as the adoption of preventive measures by the general population is predominantly a behavioral phenomenon that is often influenced by peoples knowledge and attitudes. This study aimed to assess the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 and their interrelationships among the population of Bangladesh aged 18 years and above. This study adopted a web-based cross-sectional survey design and collected data from 1056 respondents using the online platform Google Form. We employed the independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's product-moment correlation, and Spearman rank-order correlation to produce the bivariate level statistics. We also run multiple linear and logistic regression models to identify the factors affecting knowledge, attitude, and preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19. The respondents had an average knowledge score of 17.29 (Standard Deviation (SD) = 3.30). The average score for attitude scale toward COVID-19 was 13.6 (SD=3.7). The respondents had excellent preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 (mean 7.7, SD=0.72). However, this study found that knowledge and attitudes did not matter for preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19. Instead, education appeared as a sole predictor for preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19; that means preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 was lower among the less educated respondents. This study suggests increasing education as a long-term strategy and taking immediate action to increase knowledge and decrease negative attitudes toward COVID-19 through targeted health education initiatives as a short-term strategy.","output":"Do knowledge and attitudes matter for preventive behavioral practices toward the COVID-19?

This has challenged the health-care systems, which cater to the needs of patients despite their cultural and linguistic barriers, in these countries. Most studies on this topic have focused on the perspectives of health-care providers in delivering their service. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how hospitalized Arabic-speaking patients experienced their interaction with the Norwegian health-care system. METHODS: In-depth interviews with 20 participants and researchers participant observation were conducted to explore the idiosyncratic details and ascribed meanings that foreign-born patients attach to their everyday experience of the Norwegian health-care system. Thematic analysis was performed on the transcribed and translated versions of the in-depth interviews. RESULTS: The findings of this study indicated three interrelated core themes. Firstly, there exist challenges in understanding and being understood because of linguistic and cultural differences of newly migrated patients. Secondly, some patients missed the holistic and direct care available in their home countries. Finally, patients were satisfied with the Norwegian health-care system because of its compassion, care, and respect toward them as well as advanced health-care equipment. CONCLUSION: Arabic-speaking patients in Norwegian hospitals experienced long waiting times and linguistic problems. Hence, a better and specialized interpreter service may resolve problems emanating from communication within the system and the subsequent delays in treatment. Compassionate care and the feeling of respect and love is the core strength of the Norwegian system as perceived by the patients.","output":"Navigating the care between two distinct cultures: a qualitative study of the experiences of Arabic-speaking immigrants in Norwegian hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complications that arise in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia are acute respiratory distress syndrome, often leading to mechanical ventilation, shock requiring vasopressors, acute kidney injury, stroke, thromboembolic phenomena, and myocardial injury.

We studied the ability of breath analysis using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) for diagnosis of COVID-19 and as a predictor for subsequent requirement for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Methods We undertook a single centre prospective observational study in patients with COVID-19, other respiratory tract infections and healthy controls. Participants provided one breath sample for GC-IMS analysis. We used cross validation analysis to create models that were then tested against the original cohort data. Further multivariable analysis was undertaken to adjust for differences between the comparator groups. Results Between 01/02/2021 and 24/05/2021 we recruited 113 participants, of whom 72 (64%) had COVID-19, 20 (18%) had another respiratory tract infection and 21 (19%) were healthy controls. Differentiation between patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls, and patients with COVID-19 and those with other respiratory tract infections, was achieved with high accuracy. Identification of patients with subsequent requirement for CPAP was completed with moderate accuracy and was not independently associated on multivariable analysis. Conclusions We have shown that GC-IMS has a high capability to distinguish between acute COVID-19 infection and other disease states.

Background: People in need of care are particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to their age and previous illnesses. At the same time, a large number of daily contacts between nursing staff and those in need of care increase the risk of transmission of the disease. AIM: The study aims to illustrate (I) to what extent home care services and semi-residential care facilities are affected by COVID-19, (II) human and material resources, (III) the care situation of those in need of care and (IV) the organizational handling of the situation and outline support requests to politicians. METHODS: More than 12,000 home-care nursing services and semi-residential care facilities were invited to participate in an online survey with quantitative and qualitative elements, 701 nursing services (response rate 7,3 %) and 96 semi-residential facilities (response rate 3,5 %) took part. RESULTS: Almost a third (30,1 %, 189 / 627) of the nursing services surveyed are affected by confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 among clients. About half of the services report a reduced use of SGB V (47,6 %, 288 / 605) or SGB XI services (59,7 %, 375 / 628).

Kinetic studies showed that acidic conditions were more conducive to the ozone degradation of BPAF than alkaline conditions. In the presence of common anions, Br- and SO42- promoted the degradation of BPAF, whereas NO2-, NO3-, HSO3- inhibited the degradation, and the other anions and cations had no significant effect. The degradation products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and were mainly manifested in hydroxylation, carboxylation and cleavage of benzene ring. The addition of NO2-, HSO3- and Br-produced the corresponding free radicals, resulting in the parent compound being attacked and affecting the degradation efficiency and pathways. The theoretical calculated results showed that the ortho-site of the BPAF phenolic hydroxyl group was more active than the meta-position, and it's more likely for free radicals to attack ortho-sites and initiate substitution reactions. Toxicity assessment of the products in the process of ozone degradation showed that toxicity of the products was reduced by benzene ring cleavage and a reduction in the F atomic number. However, the toxicity of nitro and brominated products of BPAF was increased. These findings provide some new insights into the role of common ions in ozonation process and product formation, and supplement the existing conclusions.

Elective health care services including diagnostics, therapeutics and elective surgical services were put on hold, leading to delays seriously affecting cancer and non-cancer related services. In spite of lessons learnt during the first wave, similar issues have persisted during the second wave, increasing the pressure on an already fragile infrastructure. METHODS: Information related to surgical patients admitted since lock down (March to August 2020) as an emergency was collected on a structured proforma and analysed. Data was gathered from prospectively kept patient admission lists and Electronic Discharge summaries. All the patients who were directly or indirectly affected with poor outcomes including delayed diagnosis and treatment were identified and included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were admitted as an emergency during this period. Of these Eight patients admitted under surgical care were included in the study. Four out of eight patients were diagnosed with advanced cancer and the remainder presented with complications of benign pathologies. Of the four patients with advanced cancer, three patients had advanced colorectal and the fourth had advanced ovarian cancer. All four patients either presented late or had delayed access to investigations. Three out four patients with benign disease presented with complications due to cancellation of elective and semi urgent services. One patient who was COVID positive and presented with bowel perforation died after a prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSION: There is definite evidence of unfavourable patient outcomes in non COVID patients as a result of the COVID pandemic. As COVID is unlikely to whither down in the very near future and highs and lows are expected, rapid and safe reintroduction of elective health care services affected by COVID is the call of the hour.

Pre-clinical mouse models of pain-induced affective behavior vary widely in methodology and results, impairing progress towards improved therapeutics. To systematically investigate the effect of long-term inflammatory pain on exploratory behavior and stress coping strategy, we assessed male C57BL/6J mice in the forced swim test (FST), elevated zero maze (EZM), and open field test (OFT) at four and six weeks post-injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), while controlling for testing order and combination. Inflammatory pain did not induce a passive stress coping strategy in the FST and did not reduce exploratory behavior in the EZM or the OFT. Using systematic correlational analysis and composite behavioral scores, we found no consistent association among measures for mice with or without inflammatory pain. A meta-analysis of similar studies indicated a modest, significant effect of CFA on exploratory behavior, but not immobility in the FST, and high heterogeneity among effect sizes in all three paradigms. Given the urgency for understanding the mechanisms of pain comorbidities and identifying novel therapies, these findings support the reallocation of our limited resources away from such unreliable assays and toward motivated and naturalistic behaviors. Future studies in pain and psychiatric translational research may benefit by considering outcomes beyond binary categorization, quantifying the associations between multiple measured behaviors, and agnostically identifying subtle yet meaningful patterns in behaviors.","output":"Long-term inflammatory pain does not impact exploratory behavior and stress coping strategies in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Francesco Finazzi and Alessandro Fass use location data collected by an earthquake-monitoring app to gauge compliance with lockdown measures in Italy.","output":"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Italian mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Newly emerged pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 highlight the urgent need for assays that detect levels of neutralizing antibodies that may be protective.

Only 23% (16/68) of donors had been hospitalized. We also studied 16 samples from subjects found to have anti-spike protein IgG during surveillance screening of asymptomatic individuals. We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers, and in vitro VN titer. Anti-RBD plasma IgG correlated slightly better than anti-ECD IgG titer with VN titer. The probability of a VN titer 160 was 80% or greater with anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers of 1:1350. Thirty-seven percent (25/68) of convalescent plasma donors lacked VN titers 160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment.

Cancer patients have mainly accessed these services, but there is growing consensus about the importance of promoting access for patients with non-malignant disease. Bad survival prognosis and patient's frailty are usual dimensions to decide PC inclusion. Objectives: The main aim of this work is to design and evaluate three quantitative models based on machine learning approaches to predict frailty and mortality on older patients in the context of supporting palliative care decision making: one-year mortality, survival regression and one-year frailty classification. Methods: The dataset used in this study is composed of 39,310 hospital admissions for 19,753 older patients (age >= 65) from January 1st, 2011 to December 30th, 2018. All prediction models were based on Gradient Boosting Machines. From the initial pool of variables at hospital admission, 20 were selected by a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the random forest's GINI importance criterion. Besides, we run an independent grid search to find the best hyperparameters in each model. The evaluation was performed by 10-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) and mean absolute error (MAE) were reported. The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to compare our proposed approach with classical survival methods. Results: The one-year mortality model achieved an AUC ROC of 0.87 +- 0.01; the mortality regression model achieved an MAE of 329.97 +- 5.24 days. The one-year frailty classification reported an AUC ROC of 0.9 +- 0.01. The Spearman's correlation between the admission frailty index and the survival time was -0.1, while the point-biserial correlation between one-year frailty index and survival time was -0.16. Conclusions: One-year mortality model performance is at a state-of-the-art level. Frailty Index used in this study behaves coherently with other works in the literature. One-year frailty classifier demonstrated that frailty status within the year could be predicted accurately.

Among pregnant women, risk factors for depression included lower income, fewer children, unemployment, thinking that one has COVID-19, high-risk pregnancy, earlier gestational age, and increased pregnancy-related stress. Protective factors included increased partner support, healthy behaviors, and positive appraisal of the pregnancy. Thus, being pregnant is associated with reduced risk for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Increased social support, engaging in health behaviors and positive appraisal may enhance resilience. Future studies of pregnant versus non-pregnant women could clarify the role of pregnancy during stressful events, and clarify aspects of susceptibility and resilience during pregnancy.","output":"Womens Depressive Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a serious global threat. At the time of writing, there are no specific therapeutic agents or vaccines to combat this disease. This study was designed to identify the SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors using drug molecule information retrieved from DrugBank 5.0 (Wishart et al.) Methods: A set of common pharmacophores were generated from a series of 22 known SARS-CoV inhibitors. The best pharmacophore used for virtual screening (VS) of DrugBank using the Phase module followed by structure-based virtual screening (VS) using Glide (Release 2020-1;Schr?dinger LLC, New York, NY, USA) with SARS-CoV-2 main protease and 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. Results: Six hits were selected based on the fitness score, extra-precision Glide score, and binding affinity with the main protease (Mpro). The predicted inhibitor constant (Ki) values of the 3 best hits, DB03777, DB06834, and DB07456, were 0.8176, 0.2148, and 0.1006 ?M, respectively. An MD simulation of DB07456 and DB13592 with the Mpro demonstrated stable protein-ligand complexes. Conclusion: The selected inhibitors displayed a similar type of binding interaction with co-ligands and remdesivir, and the predicted Ki values of 2 inhibitors were found to be superior to remdesivir.

METHODS: RNA remnants, purified from diagnostic nasopharyngeal specimens, were used as templates for RT-PCR specific detection of SG E gene RNA. As controls, we also detected viral genomic RNA for the E gene and/or a human housekeeping gene (RNase P). RESULTS: We assessed the samples of 60 RT-PCR-positive cases with a prolonged viral SARS-CoV-2 shedding (24-101 days) since the first diagnostic RT-PCR. SG viral RNA was detected in 12/60 (20%) of the persistent cases, 28-79 days after the onset of symptoms. The age range of the cases with prolonged viral shedding and presence of SG RNA was quite wide (40-100 years), and they were equally distributed between males (42%) and females (58%). None was HIV positive, although seven were immunosuppressed. According to the severity of the COVID-19 episodes they were mild (40%), intermediate (20%), and severe (40%)Conclusion: In a percentage of persistent positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive cases the presence of actively replicating virus may be inferred, far beyond diagnosis.

COVID-19, the disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is remarkable for persistent, severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation that places considerable strain on critical care resources. Because recovery from COVID-19 associated respiratory failure can be prolonged, tracheostomy may facilitate patient management and optimize use of mechanical ventilators. Several important considerations apply to planning tracheostomies for COVID-19 infected patients. After performing a literature review of tracheostomies during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, we synthesized important learning points from these experiences and suggest an approach for perioperative teams involved in these procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.Multidisciplinary teams should be involved in decisions regarding timing and appropriateness of the procedure. As the theoretical risk of disease transmission is increased during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), stringent infectious precautions are warranted. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available and worn by all personnel present during tracheostomy. The number of people in the room should be limited to those absolute necessary. Using the most experienced available operators will minimize the total time that staff are exposed to an infectious aerosolized environment. An approach that secures the airway in the safest and quickest manner will minimize the time any part of the airway is open to the environment. Deep neuromuscular blockade (train of four ratio = 0) will facilitate surgical exposure and prevent aerosolization due to patient movement or coughing. For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed. Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team. If possible after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of healthcare worker infection.Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high-risk for all members of the procedural team. To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local/institutional protocols.","output":"Perioperative Considerations for Tracheostomies in The Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching its worst heights, people are interested in the origin of SARS-CoV-2. This study started with two important questions: first, were there any similar atypical pneumonia outbreaks, even on a smaller level, reported between SARS in 2004 and COVID-19 in 2019/20 in China. Second, examining the beta-coronavirus most closely related to date with SARS-CoV-2 at the genome sequence level, strain RaTG13 (CoV4991), which was sampled from a horseshoe bat in Yunnan province, we asked where exactly did it come from. It was found that RaTG13/CoV4991 was collected from Tongguan mineshaft in Mojiang, Yunnan, China, in 2013. Surprisingly, the same mineshaft was also associated with a severe pneumonia-like illness in miners in 2012 killing three of the six miners. A Master's thesis (in the Chinese language) was found on the cnki.net website which described in detail the severe illness in miners. The thesis concluded that a SARS-like CoV originating from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) was the predicted causative agent. The cases were remotely monitored by a prominent pulmonologist in China. Retrospective analysis of the pneumonia cases shows striking similarities with COVID-19. Bilateral pneumonia, vascular complications like pulmonary thromboembolism, and secondary infections are the main similarities. The treatment regimes were similar to the current treatments for COVID-19. We propose that the Mojiang mineshaft miners' illness could provide important clues to the origin of SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS A total of 36 patients (55 tumors) were treated with the LF system (915 MHz) and 30 patients (39 tumors) were treated with the HF system (2450 MHz) between January 2011 and March 2016. Computed tomography (CT) scans performed prior to and 24 hours after the ablation were used to measure the size of the ablation zone and to calculate the ablation margin. The subsequent CTs were used to detect local tumor progression. Possible predictive factors for local progression were analyzed. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 3 months with a median of 13.8 months for the LF group and 11.7 months for the HF group. RESULTS The ablation margin (P = 0.015), blood vessel proximity (P = 0.006), and colorectal origin (P = 0.029) were significantly associated with the local progression rate. The local progression rates were 36.3% for LF ablations and 12.8% for HF ablations.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 clinical phenotypes. FINDINGS: PIMS-TS children had significantly elevated levels of cytokines, IFN, IL-2, TNF, IL-1, IFN, IFN, IL-6, IL-15, IL-17A, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IL-Ra; elevated chemokines, CCL2, CCL19, CCL20 and CXCL10 and elevated VEGF, Granzyme B and PDL-1 in comparison to COVID-19, seropositive and controls.

Nevertheless, clinical placements are an important pillar of the undergraduate curriculum and new techniques must be developed to better facilitate its delivery. Our aim was to create a programme that effectively met the required curriculum learning outcomes for medical students. METHOD: In September 2020, students from Queens University, Belfast, returned to placement following months of online and distance learning. Having previously focused on bedside and case-based teaching, our priority remained with patient and student safety. Complimentary non-clinical and simulation methods were introduced including laparoscopic skills, suture and knot tying sessions and foundation competencies. Rating scale questionnaires were distributed over a four-week period following each session. RESULTS: 32 sessions were carried out and 53 questionnaires returned.

METHODS: A total of 707 neonatal BSI cases were retrospectively analyzed. The bacteria in blood culture-positive samples were cultured, identified, and analyzed for drug sensitivity by routine methods. Statistical software was used to compare and analyze the basic data, pathogenic information, and drug resistance of the main bacteria. RESULTS: The 5-year average positive rate of neonatal blood culture was 2.50%. The number of specimens submitted for inspection in 2020 significantly decreased. The top five infectious pathogens with the highest proportion were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (67.35%), of which Staphylococcus epidermidis had the highest proportion (31.26%), followed by Escherichia coli (12.87%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.05%), Streptococcus agalactiae (8.63%), and Staphylococcus aureus (3.25%). Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were dominant, accounting for 69.45%. The main G(+) bacteria had a higher rate of resistance to erythromycin and penicillin G. The main Gram-negative (G(C)) bacteria had a high resistance rate to a variety of antibacterial drugs, especially cephalosporin antibiotics. The overall resistance of K. pneumoniae was higher than that of E. coli. The top two fungi detected were Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans. C. parapsilosis did not appear to be resistant to antibiotics, while C. albicans was resistant to multiple antibiotics. The type of microbial infection had a statistically significant difference in the positive rate among the age at delivery and wards (p < 0.05). There were significant differences in the detection of fungi among these groups (p < 0.05). The positive rate of G(+) bacteria in the term newborns was significantly higher than that in the preterm newborns (p < 0.05). Preterm newborns are more susceptible to pneumonia. CONCLUSION: G(+) bacteria are the main pathogens of neonatal BSI. Preterm newborns are more likely to be infected with G(C) bacteria. E. coli and K. pneumoniae are the most common G(C) bacteria, and both have a high resistance rate to a variety of antibacterial drugs.

Such patients also suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome (37.8%) and pneumonia three times more than patients without comorbidities. The survival distributions were statistically significant (chi-square = 26.06, p  0.001). CONCLUSION: Multiple comorbidities in COVID-19 patients are linked to severe clinical symptoms, disease complications, and critical disease progression. The presence of one or more comorbidities worsened the survival rate of patients.","output":"The Impact of Comorbidities on the Outcomes of Egyptian COVID-19 Patients: A Follow-Up Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: U.S. maternal and infant mortality rates constitute an important public health problem, because these rates surpass those in developed countries and are characterized by stark disparities for racial/ethnic minorities, rural residents, and individuals with less privileged socioeconomic status due to social determinants of health (SDoH). Methods: A critical review of the maternal and infant mortality literature was performed to determine multilevel SDoH factors leading to mortality disparities with a life course lens. Results: Black mothers and infants fared the worst in terms of mortality rates, likely due to the accumulation of SDoH experienced as a result of structural racism across the life course. Upstream SDoH are important contributors to disparities in maternal and infant mortality. More research is needed on the effectiveness of continuous quality improvement initiatives for the maternalCinfant dyad, and expanding programs such as paid maternity leave, quality, stable and affordable housing, and social safety-nets (Medicaid, CHIP, WIC), in reducing maternal and infant mortality. Finally, it is important to address research gaps in individual, interpersonal, community, and societal factors, because they affect maternal and infant mortality and related disparities. Conclusion: Key SDoH at multiple levels affect maternal and infant health. These SDoH shape and perpetuate disparities across the lifespan and are implicated in maternal and infant mortality disparities.","output":"A Critical Review on the Complex Interplay between Social Determinants of Health and Maternal and Infant Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic was announced a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the Government of India declared a nationwide lockdown on March 25, 2020 to prevent community transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19.

One preventive measure that has been incorporated to help reduce the virus spread is the strict implementation of utilizing a COVID-19 tracing application, such as the MorChana mobile application of Thailand. This study aimed to evaluate the factors affecting the actual usage of the MorChana mobile application. Through the integration of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), latent variables such as performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), hedonic motivation (HM), habit (HB), perceived risk (PCR), self-efficacy (SEF), privacy (PR), trust (TR), and understanding COVID-19 (U) were considered to measure the intention to use MorChana (IU) and the actual usage (AU) of the mobile application. This study considered 907 anonymous participants who voluntarily answered an online self-administered survey collected via convenience sampling. The results show that IU presented the highest significant effect on AU, followed by HB, HM, PR, FC, U, SEF, PE, EE, TR, and SI. This is evident due to the strict implementation of using mobile applications upon entering any area of the vicinity. Moreover, PCR was not seen to be a significant latent factor affecting AU.

METHODS Eight trained volunteers cycled in 19 C/1.8 kPa (COOL), 25 C/1.2 kPa (NORM), and 34 C/1.6 kPa (HOT), while maintaining an RPE of 16. Potential differences in S following the onset of exercise were assessed by comparing rates of esophageal temperature change (T es/t); and estimated S values using a traditional two-compartment thermometric model (S therm) of changes in rectal (T re) and skin (T sk) temperature, and partitional calorimetry (S cal). RESULTS After 15 min of exercise, workload decreased more in HOT vs. COOL (P = 0.03), resulting in a shorter time (HOT: 40.7  14.9 min; COOL: 53.5  18.7 min; P = 0.04) to 70 % of initial workload. However, there were no preceding differences in T es/t between conditions (P = 0.18). S therm values were different between HOT and COOL during the first 5 min of exercise (P < 0.05), primarily due to negative S therm values (-32  15 kJ min(-1)) in COOL, which according to partitional calorimetric measurements, required improbably high (~56 kJ min(-1)) rates of evaporation when no sweating on the back and thigh was observed until after 7.6  1.5 min and 4.8  1.7 min of exercise, respectively. S cal values in the first 5 min of exercise confirmed S was actually positive in COOL (+21  8 kJ min(-1)) and not negative. Different S therm values following the onset of exercise at different environmental temperatures are simply due to transient differences in the rate of change in T sk. CONCLUSION Reductions in self-paced exercise intensity in the heat are not mediated by early differences in S following the onset of exercise.","output":"Do greater rates of body heat storage precede the accelerated reduction of self-paced exercise intensity in the heat?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite growing recognition among journalists and political pundits, the concept of victimhood has been largely ignored in empirical social science research. In this article, we develop a theory about, and use unique nationally-representative survey data to estimate, two manifestations of victimhood: an egocentric one entailing only perceptions of ones own victimhood, and one focused on blaming the system. We find that these manifestations of victimhood cut across partisan, ideological, and sociodemographic lines, suggesting that feelings of victimhood are confined to neither actual victims nor those partisans on the losing side of elections. Moreover, both manifestations of victimhood, while related to candidate support and various racial attitudes, prove to be distinct from related psychological constructs, such as (collective) narcissism, system justification, and relative deprivation. Finally, an experiment based on candidate rhetoric demonstrates that some political messaging can make supporters feel like victims, which has consequences for subsequent attitudes and behavior.

It is an essential pediatric social determinant of health measure that is useful for exploring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on families of young children. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the predictors of diaper need and the associations between diaper need and psychosocial outcomes among under-resourced families with neurodiverse children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 129 caregivers of children aged 0 to 36 months who completed an online survey in early 2021, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed a diaper need assessment, the Hunger Vital Signs Food Insecurity Screener, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Infant Behavioral Questionnaire subscale. Relationships were explored using independent samples t-tests, chi-square tests, and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of caregivers reported some diaper need, and 87.6 % reported food insecurity. Greater than one third (39.5%) reported high diaper need. Common mitigation strategies included using a towel or other cloth like a diaper, not using a diaper, and keeping the child in the same diaper for longer than usual. In multivariate modeling, food insecurity, household size, and parent age were significantly associated with high diaper need. Families experiencing food insecurity were 4.24 times more likely to experience high diaper need than food-secure families. High diaper need compared to low or no diaper need was associated with increased parent perceived stress. DISCUSSION: We found high levels of diaper need and food insecurity for families during the COVID-19 pandemic. The association of high diaper need and stress indicates an inadequate supply of diapers adversely affects parent stress.

Patients with distant metastasis at presentation, patients with a tumor more than 3 cm from the anorectal ring, and patients not undergoing neoadjuvant therapy were excluded, leaving 79 patients (54 men and 25 women) with a mean age of 59.2 years (range, 22-85 years) for this study. 13 patients completed neoadjuvant therapy before the original evaluation, and they are excluded from the report of initial clinical assessment. Before treatment, 50 patients were staged as T3 and 16 patients as T2. The mean level in the rectum superior to the anorectal ring was 1.2 cm (range, -0.5 to 3 cm). In terms of fixity, 31 of the tumors were mobile, 27 were tethered, and 8 showed early fixation. Ulceration was absent in 8 cases, minimal in 12 cases, superficial in 7 cases, moderate in 22 cases, and deep in 17 cases. The mean pretreatment tumor size tumor was 4.8 cm (range, 1.5-12 cm). The median external beam radiation was 5,400 cGy (range, 3,000-8,040 cGy), and 77 patients underwent chemotherapy. RESULTS The mean follow-up period was 34.2 months (range, 1.9-113.9 months). There were no perioperative mortalities. The conversion rate was 2.5%, and the mean largest incision length was 4.3 cm (range, 1.2-21 cm). For 84% of the patients, the incision was less than 6.0 cm, and 46% of the patients had no abdominal incision for delivery of the specimen. The mean estimated blood loss was 367 ml (range, 75-2,200 ml). All the patients had a temporary diverting stoma. The major morbidity rate was 11%, and the minor morbidity rate was 19%. The major complications included four full-thickness rectal prolapses with repair, one ischemic neorectum with successful reanastomosis, two bowel obstructions, and two failed anastomoses requiring stoma. The ypT stages included 22 complete responses, 12 cases of ypT1, 22 cases of ypT2, 23 cases of ypT3; 65 cases of ypN0, and 14 cases of ypN + (T3 = 7, T2 = 4, T1 = 3). The local recurrence rate was 2.5% (2/79), and the distant metastases rate was 10.1% (8/79). The KM5YAS rate was 97%. Overall, 90% of the patients lived without a stoma. Neorectal loss was due to positive margins or recurrence and was followed by abdominoperineal resection in three cases and ischemia in two cases. The condition of two patients was not reversed due to comorbidities, and one patient had a stoma secondary to bowel obstruction.

The magnitude of this shift and the factors that have accompanied this new unplanned work setting go beyond what the software engineering community has previously understood to be remote work. To find out how developers and their productivity were affected, we distributed two surveys (with a combined total of 3,634 responses that answered all required questions) -- weeks apart to understand the presence and prevalence of the benefits, challenges, and opportunities to improve this special circumstance of remote work. From our thematic qualitative analysis and statistical quantitative analysis, we find that there is a dichotomy of developer experiences influenced by many different factors (that for some are a benefit, while for others a challenge). For example, a benefit for some was being close to family members but for others having family members share their working space and interrupting their focus, was a challenge. Our surveys led to powerful narratives from respondents and revealed the scale at which these experiences exist to provide insights as to how the future of (pandemic) remote work can evolve.","output":"A Tale of Two Cities: Software Developers Working from Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to identify the negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on supply chains and propose strategies to deal with the impacts in the context of the readymade garment (RMG) industry supply chain of an emerging economy: Bangladesh To achieve the aims, a methodological framework is proposed through a literature review, expert inputs, and a decision-aid tool, namely the grey-based digraph-matrix method A total of 10 types of negative impacts and 22 strategic measures to tackle the impacts were identified based on the literature review and expert inputs Then, the grey-based digraph-matrix was applied for modeling the strategic measures based on their influence to deal with the impacts Findings reveal that the strategies &ldquo;manufacturing flexibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;diversify the source of supply&rdquo;, and &ldquo;develop backup suppliers&rdquo;have significant positive consequences for managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the RMG supply chain The findings help industrial managers recover from supply chain disruptions by identifying and classifying the impacts and strategies required to manage the major supply chain disturbances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic As a theoretical contribution, this study is one of few initial attempts to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and the strategies to deal with the impacts in the supply chain context","output":"Strategies to Manage the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Supply Chain: Implications for Improving Economic and Social Sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several viruses encode factors that promote host mRNA degradation to silence gene expression. It is unclear, however, whether cellular mRNA turnover pathways are engaged to assist in this process. In Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus this phenotype is enacted by the host shutoff factor SOX. Here we show that SOX-induced mRNA turnover is a two-step process, in which mRNAs are first cleaved internally by SOX itself then degraded by the cellular exonuclease Xrn1. SOX therefore bypasses the regulatory steps of deadenylation and decapping normally required for Xrn1 activation. SOX is likely recruited to translating mRNAs, as it cosediments with translation initiation complexes and depletes polysomes. Cleaved mRNA intermediates accumulate in the 40S fraction, indicating that recognition occurs at an early stage of translation. This is the first example of a viral protein commandeering cellular mRNA turnover pathways to destroy host mRNAs, and suggests that Xrn1 is poised to deplete messages undergoing translation in mammalian cells.","output":"Coordinated Destruction of Cellular Messages in Translation Complexes by the Gammaherpesvirus Host Shutoff Factor and the Mammalian Exonuclease Xrn1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly spreading disease with a high mortality. In this research, the interactions between specific flavonols and the 2019-nCoV receptor binding domain (RBD), transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and cathepsins (CatB and CatL) were analyzed. According to the relative binding capacity index (RBCI) calculated based on the free energy of binding and calculated inhibition constants, it was determined that robinin (ROB) and gossypetin (GOS) were the most effective flavonols on all targets. While the binding free energy of ROB with the spike glycoprotein RBD, TMPRSS2, CatB, and CatL were C5.02, C7.57, C10.10, and C6.11 kcal/mol, the values for GOS were C4.67, C5.24, C8.31, and C6.76, respectively. Furthermore, both compounds maintained their stability for at least 170 ns on respective targets in molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular mechanics PoissonCBoltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations also corroborated these data. Considering Lipinskis rule of five, ROB and GOS exhibited 3 (MW>500, N or O>10, NH or OH>5), and 1 (NH or OH>5) violations, respectively. Neither ROB nor GOS showed AMES toxicity or hepatotoxicity. The LD50 of these compounds in rats were 2.482 and 2.527 mol/kg, respectively.

Hypercholesterolemia is among the main risk factors for developing cardiovascular events, and is highly prevalent in the Mexican population. The primary objective of the present work was to assess the effect of a dietary portfolio (DP) with functional foods containing dehydrated nopal, soy protein, chia seeds, inulin, and oats in LDL-C and TC concentrations of subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia. Also, we explored the changes in the profile of the lipoprotein subclasses measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). METHODS Sixty-two subjects (47 women, 15 men) with mild hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C, 130  190 mg/dL, TC > 200 mg/dL) completed the randomized, parallel, controlled study. The dietary intervention was given in two stages. First, a dietary standardization stage with a low saturated fat diet (LSFD) which matched the habitual energy intake of the volunteers for 2-weeks, followed by 2.5 months of dietary intervention with a LSFD plus placebo (PL) or DP. RESULTS Subjects who consumed the LSFD + DP interventions had a significantly higher reduction of LDL-C (-18.05%, P = 0.003) and TC (-17.08%, P = 0.02) compared to volunteers who consumed an LSFD for the same period. Furthermore, the lipoprotein subclass profiling showed that the small low-density-lipoproteins, and the small high-density-lipoproteins significantly decreased (P = 0.04, P < 0.001, respectively), conveying a less atherogenic state. At the end of the study, 78% of the subjects who consumed LSFD + DP reduced their LDL-C below 160 mg/dL, and of these, 47% reduced it below 130 mg/dL.

Inflammation can activate bone marrow HSPCs, leading to enhanced myelopoiesis to replace cells, such as neutrophils, which are attracted to inflamed tissues. We have previously shown that HSPC activation promotes parasite persistence and expansion in experimental visceral leishmaniasis through the increased production of permissive monocytes. However, it is not clear if the presence of the parasite in the bone marrow was required for infection-adapted myelopoiesis. We therefore hypothesized that persistent forms of Leishmania major (cutaneous leishmaniasis) could also activate HSPCs and myeloid precursors in the C57Bl/6 mouse model of intradermal infection in the ear. The accrued influx of myeloid cells to the lesion site corresponded to an increase in myeloid-biased HSPCs in the bone marrow and spleen in mice infected with a persistent strain of L. major, together with an increase in monocytes and monocyte-derived myeloid cells in the spleen. Analysis of the bone marrow cytokine and chemokine environment revealed an attenuated type I and type II interferon response in the mice infected with the persistent strain compared to the self-healing strain, while both strains induced a rapid upregulation of myelopoietic cytokines, such as IL-1 and GM-CSF. These results demonstrate that an active infection in the bone marrow is not necessary for the induction of infection-adapted myelopoiesis, and underline the importance of considering alterations to the bone marrow output when analyzing in vivo host-pathogen interactions.","output":"Persistent Cutaneous Leishmania major Infection Promotes Infection-Adapted Myelopoiesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The developed countries of the world were ill-prepared for the pandemic that they have suffered.

Existing quantitative infection risk assessment models analyze the observed cases by assuming a homogeneous infectious particle concentration and ignore the spatial infection pattern, which may cause errors. This study aims at developing an approach to analyze spatial infection patterns associated with infectious respiratory diseases or other airborne transmissible diseases using infection risk assessment and likelihood estimation. Mathematical likelihood, based on binomial probability, was used to formulate the retrospective component with some additional mathematical treatments. Together with an infection risk assessment model that can address spatial heterogeneity, the method can be used to analyze the spatial infection pattern and retrospectively estimate the influencing parameters causing the cases, such as the infectious source strength of the pathogen. A Varicella outbreak was selected to demonstrate the use of the new approach. The infectious source strength estimated by the Wells-Riley concept using the likelihood estimation was compared with the estimation using the existing method. It was found that the maximum likelihood estimation matches the epidemiological observation of the outbreak case much better than the estimation under the assumption of homogeneous infectious particle concentration. Influencing parameters retrospectively estimated using the new approach can be used as input parameters in quantitative infection risk assessment of the disease under other scenarios.

PARTICIPANTS: The Massachusetts Senior Care Association and Hebrew SeniorLife rapidly organized a Central Command team, targeted 123 \\"special focus\\" facilities with infection control deficiencies for on-site and virtual consultations, and offered all 360 facilities weekly webinars and answers to questions regarding infection control procedures. The facilities were also informed of resources for the acquisition of personal protective equipment (PPE), backup staff, and SARS-CoV-2 testing. MEASUREMENTS: We used two data sources: (1) four state audits of all NHs, and (2) weekly NH reports to the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis. Primary independent process measures were the checklist scores and adherence to each of its six core competencies. Primary outcomes were the average weekly rates of new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in residents and staff. We used a hurdle mixed effects model adjusted for county COVID-19 prevalence to estimate relationships between infection control process measures and rates of new infections or deaths. RESULTS: Both resident and staff infection rates started higher in special focus facilities, then rapidly declined to the same low level in both groups. Adherence to infection control processes, especially proper wearing of PPE and cohorting, was significantly associated with declines in weekly infection and mortality rates. CONCLUSION: This statewide effort could serve as a national model for other states to prevent the devastating effects of pandemics such as COVID-19 in frail NH residents.","output":"Stemming the Tide of COVID-19 Infections in Massachusetts Nursing Homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our continuous screening for bioactive microbial natural products, the culture extracts of a terrestrial Actinomycetes sp.

At present, there are no true curative treatments that can stop the progression of the disease, and new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. Advances in cell-based therapies provide a platform for the development of new therapeutic approaches in severe lung diseases such as COPD. At present, a lot of focus is on mesenchymal stem (stromal) cell (MSC)-based therapies, mainly due to their immunomodulatory properties. Despite increasing number of preclinical studies demonstrating that systemic MSC administration can prevent or treat experimental COPD and emphysema, clinical studies have not been able to reproduce the preclinical results and to date no efficacy or significantly improved lung function or quality of life has been observed in COPD patients. Importantly, the completed appropriately conducted clinical trials uniformly demonstrate that MSC treatment in COPD patients is well tolerated and no toxicities have been observed. All clinical trials performed so far, have been phase I/II studies, underpowered for the detection of potential efficacy. There are several challenges ahead for this field such as standardized isolation and culture procedures to obtain a cell product with high quality and reproducibility, administration strategies, improvement of methods to measure outcomes, and development of potency assays. Moreover, COPD is a complex pathology with a diverse spectrum of clinical phenotypes, and therefore it is essential to develop methods to select the subpopulation of patients that is most likely to potentially respond to MSC administration. In this chapter, we will discuss the current state of the art of MSC-based cell therapy for COPD and the hurdles that need to be overcome.","output":"Clinical Application of Stem/Stromal Cells in COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebola virus infection is a highly lethal disease for which there are no effective therapeutic or preventive treatments.

Our aim was to develop a classification of the causes and clinical relevance of CADe FPs, and to assess the relative distribution of FPs in real-life setting. METHODS In a post-hoc analysis of a randomized trial comparing colonoscopy with and without CADe (NCT: 04079478), we extracted 40 CADe-colonoscopy videos. By modified Delphi process, 4 expert endoscopists identified the main domains for reasons and clinical relevance of FPs. Then, 2 expert endoscopists manually examined each FP activation, and classified it according to the proposed domains. Analysis was limited to the withdrawal phase. RESULTS The 2 main domains for the causes of CADe-FPs were identified as artifacts due to either mucosal wall or bowel content, whereas clinical relevance was defined by the time spent for FP and the FP rate per minute. Mean FPs per colonoscopy was 27.3  13.1, of which 24  12 (88%) and 3.2  2.6 (12%) due to artifacts from bowel wall and bowel content, respectively. Of the 27.3 FP per colonoscopy, 1.6 (5.7%) required an additional exploration time of 4.8  6.2 seconds per FP, ie, 0.7% of the mean withdrawal time (WT). In detail, 15 (24.2%), 33 (53.2%) and 14 (22.6%) FPs were classified as of mild, moderate, or severe clinical relevance. Rate of FP per minute of WT was 2.4  1.2, being higher for FPs due to artifacts from bowel wall than for those from bowel content (2.4  0.6 vs 0.3  0.2, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS False positives by CADe are primarily due to artifacts from the bowel wall. Despite a high frequency, FPs result in a negligible 1% increase of the total withdrawal time as most of them are immediately discarded by the endoscopists.","output":"Computer-aided detection-assisted colonoscopy: classification and relevance of false positives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia to respond to the expected increase in demand associated with COVID-19. DESIGN: Analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020). SETTINGS: All Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator-to-bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities. RESULTS: The 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population). Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase). This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline). An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators. CONCLUSIONS: The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID-19. But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.","output":"Surge capacity of intensive care units in case of acute increase in demand caused by COVID-19 in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In emergency settings, fast access to medical imaging for diagnostic is pivotal for clinical decision making.

However, some patients may experience a worsened arrhythmia phenotype after ablation. We aimed to determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of arrhythmia exacerbation (AE) after post-infarction VT ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 1187 consecutive patients (93% men, median age 68 years, median ejection fraction 30%) who underwent post-infarction VT ablation at six centres were included. Arrhythmia exacerbation was defined as post-ablation VT storm or incessant VT in patients without prior similar events. During follow-up (median 717 days), 426 (36%) patients experienced VT recurrence. Events qualifying as AE occurred in 67 patients (6%). Median times to VT recurrence with and without AE were 238 [interquartile range (IQR) 35-640] days and 135 (IQR 22-521) days, respectively (P = 0.25). Almost half of the patients (46%) who experienced AE experienced it within 6 months of the index procedure. Patients with AE had had longer ablation times during the ablation procedures compared to the rest of the patients (median 42 vs. 34 min, P = 0.02). Among patients with VT recurrence, the risk of death or heart transplantation was significantly higher in patients with than without AE (hazard ratio 1.99, 95% CI 1.28-3.10; P = 0.002) after adjusting for age, gender, ejection fraction, cardiac resynchronization therapy, post-ablation non-inducibility, and post-ablation amiodarone use. CONCLUSION Arrhythmia exacerbation after ablation of infarct-related VT is infrequent but is independently associated with an adverse long-term outcome among patients who experience a VT recurrence. The mechanisms and mitigation strategies of AE after catheter ablation require further investigation.","output":"Arrhythmia exacerbation after post-infarction ventricular tachycardia ablation: prevalence and prognostic significance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual meetings became the norm in academic emergency medicine (EM) departments.

Authors reported data on a five-point Likert scale, summarized as percentages, and calculated differences using Pearson's chi-squared test, where p < 0.05 was significant. Free text responses were analyzed qualitatively. Results Two-hundred-fifty-nine responses were collected, (female [55.6%], 40 years old, [39.8%]) of which 33.2% had children 7 years old. Most respondents felt the total number of virtual meetings had increased and were more likely to happen outside of regular business hours compared to in-person meetings. Most faculty preferred meetings during regular hours and liked the virtual format overall. Younger faculty respondents were more polarized in their preferences of timing of meetings and reported more pressure to accept meetings outside of regular hours.

The purpose of this study was to validate a commercially available portable refraction approach in a low-vision population. METHODS Low-vision patients (n = 26) or normally sighted patients (n = 25) underwent a refraction assessment using the Adaptica? 2WIN autorefractor, adaptor scope (Kaleidos) and VisionFit phoropter portable refraction devices, as well as a standard autorefractor (Huvitz) and phoropter (Haag-Streit). Refraction data between systems and populations were compared using intraclass correlations. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the differences between devices. RESULTS Spherical equivalent values were found to be reproducible between standard and experimental autorefraction devices (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.8) in both low-vision and normally sighted groups. Similarly, manifest refraction was highly consistent (ICC > 0.8) between devices in all groups. The Bland-Altman plots showed clinically acceptable mean differences of 0.701 between autorefraction methods and -0.116 between manifest refraction methods.

It also aimed at studying the association of AEFI with demographic and clinical characteristics of vaccinees, pre-vaccination anxiety level and prior history of COVID-19 infection (RT- PCR confirmed) status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study carried out via face-to-face or telephonic interview among 1006 health workers one week after receiving their first dose of the Covishield vaccine. Incidence of adverse events was calculated in percentage while Chi-square Test was used to check the association of AEFI with independent variables. Logistic regression was used to find out the adjusted odds ratio at 95% CI. RESULTS: Incidence of AEFI was 79.8% with local and systemic AEFI being 68.0% and 59.7% respectively. Injection site tenderness was the commonest manifestation. Local and systemic symptoms resolved in less than one week among 96.8% and 98.7% vaccinees respectively. Females were more likely to develop AEFI than males (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2C2.4). Vaccinees aged 45C59 years were 50% less likely to develop AEFI as compared to those aged less than 30 years (AOR 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3C0.8).

SETTING: Participants were recruited through the network of a community exercise facility for people with physical disabilities. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 22 wheelchair users (mean age 46  13 years; SCI [n = 19], cerebral palsy [n = 1]; multiple sclerosis [n = 1]; and bilateral limb loss [n = 1]) in either a one-on-one format or focus group.

Currently, no treatment can block or reverse the development of lung fibrosis in patients suffering from IPF. Recent studies indicate that arsenic trioxide (ATO), a safe, effective anti-cancer pro-oxidant drug, prevents the differentiation of normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) in vitro and reduces experimental pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. In this context, we investigated the anti-fibrotic effects of ATO on the main fibrosis functions of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) isolated from patients with IPF. IPF and non-IPF (control) HLFs were incubated with 0.01-1a?M ATO and stimulated with pro-fibrotic factors (PDGF-BB or TGF-?1). We measured their rates of proliferation, migration and differentiation and the cell stress response triggered by ATO. ATO did not affect cell viability but strongly inhibited the proliferation and migration of PDGF-BB-stimulated IPF and control HLFs. ATO also prevented myofibroblastic differentiation, as assessed by the expression of -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and collagen-1, and the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 in TGF-?1-stimulated HLFs. These antifibrotic effects were associated with increased expression of the transcription factor NRF2 and its target genes NQO1 and HMOX1. Genetic silencing of NRF2 inhibited the ATO-induced cell stress response but did not prevent the ATO-dependent inhibition of -SMA expression in TGF-?1-stimulated HLFs. The results demonstrate that ATO, at concentrations similar to exposure in blood plasma of ATO-treated cancer patients, counteracted pro-fibrotic activities of HLFs from IPF patients.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) relaxed rules for the use of telemedicine with easing restrictions on reimbursements, location, licensing requirements (across state lines), and the need for a prior provider-patient relationship. These changes increased the use of telemedicine in inpatient and outpatient settings for gastroenterology-related referrals. The use of inpatient telephonic or video consults helps provide timely care during the pandemic while conserving personal protective equipment and decreasing provider and patient exposure. Nevertheless, telehealth use comes at the cost of no direct patient contact and lesser reimbursements. The appropriate use of technology and equipment, training of healthcare providers, use of platforms that can be integrated into the electronic health record while protecting the privacy and the flow of information are essential components of telemedicine. Furthermore, encouraging patients to seek medical care remotely with the proper equipment and improving digital literacy without the need for physical examinations is a challenge, further compounded in elderly or hard-of-hearing patients and in patients who are more comfortable with in-person visits. The authors will systematically review and discuss how telemedicine can be integrated into the practice of gastroenterology and hepatology, with emphasis placed on discussing barriers to success and the ways they can be mitigated.","output":"Successful Distancing: Telemedicine in Gastroenterology and Hepatology During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The colossal proportion of the COVID-19 disaster, with approximately 213 million confirmed cumulative cases and 4.5 million deaths at the end of August 2021, is of historical significance that is unparalleled. The pandemic has had an impact on the physical, mental and economic welfare of human beings in every corner of the world. To contain the crisis, governments have implemented a set of policies, aimed at directing human behaviour and improving healthcare outcomes almost from the outset, with varying levels of success. The battle against the virus continues. This study utilises data on growth in daily COVID-19 confirmed cases, from 56 countries which were most affected by the pandemic and investigates the effectiveness of several policies implemented by governments. The investigation covers the period, 24 January 2020 to 25 June 2021. The policies analysed in detail constitute 13 containment and health measures, incorporated in the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. The research is based on the premise that the contexts in which policies are implemented have a bearing on the outcomes. The contexts are classified under economic status, national culture, the level of human development and population density. We find that these contexts are relevant in determining the success of alternative policy prescriptions. Overall, the containment and health measures are effective in curtailing the growth in COVID-19 cases to varying degrees across all economic contexts of countries. Containment measures are least effective in lower-middle income countries. Three of the six dimensions of Hofstede's national culture classifications tend to be positively associated with infection rates and the other three negatively associated. Moreover, national culture has a more prominent impact on the effectiveness of actions to reduce the growth in COVID-19 cases in lower-middle income countries. It is important to improve effectiveness of government policy responses to combat the pandemic by tailoring them to country-specific contexts.

The primary endpoint was to assess the prevalence of adapted patient care during the pandemic. The secondary endpoints were to describe the point of view of clinicians and patients during and after the pandemic. We analyzed 435 medical procedures between 9th of March and 30th of April. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, 47.6% of the outpatients received modified patient care. Twenty-four percent of scheduled surgeries were postponed, or were performed without perioperative chemotherapy, 18.4% followed a hypofractioned schedule, and 57% had an adaptive systemic protocol (stopped, oral protocol, and spacing between treatments). Seventy percent of physicians used telemedicine. During this period, 67% of the physicians did not feel distressed taking care of their patients. However, 70% of physicians are worried about the aftermath of the lockdown, as regards future patient care. The PRATICOVID study is the first to assess modification of patient care in cancer outpatients during an epidemic.

DATA SOURCES: The PubMed database was used to search for relevant articles. STUDY SELECTIONS: Peer-reviewed prospective and retrospective studies involving the assessment of allergy using human birth cohorts between 2014 and 2021 were evaluated. RESULTS: Parental history of allergic diseases, especially in cases involving both parents, is associated with increased risk of allergy. Exposure to prenatal and postnatal smoking and limited diet diversity were associated with increased allergic burden. The impact of early-life infections and antibiotics on disease development may be associated with the onset of asthma, though this remains debated. Cohort studies also revealed that the mode of delivery and breastfeeding duration affect the odds ratio of asthma and eczema development. Household exposures, including pets, house dust mites, and scented aeroallergens may confer protective effects, whereas high air pollution exposure and low socioeconomic status may be risk enhancing. Exposure to antibiotics during early life may be associated with increased asthma risk, whereas viral infections may lead to disease protection, though the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on allergic risk is yet to be understood.

Applying RNP capture on another coronavirus HCoV-OC43 revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between coronaviral RNAs and host proteins. Transcriptome analyses and knockdown experiments delineated 17 antiviral RBPs including ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, PARP12, and SHFL and 8 proviral RBPs such as EIF3D and CSDE1 which are responsible for co-opting multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle. This also led to the identification of LARP1, a downstream target of the mTOR signaling pathway, as an antiviral host factor that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs.

This may be assisted by using valid and reliable methods that simulate real-life situations. Interactive virtual reality (VR) technology may introduce various auditory and visual inputs that mimic real-life scenarios. However, evidence supporting the quality and strength of evidence regarding the adequacy of its psychometric properties in assessing the musculoskeletal function has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, this study reviewed the validity and reliability of VR games and real-time feedback in assessing the musculoskeletal system. RECENT FINDINGS: Nine studies were included in quality assessment. Based on outcome measures, studies were categorized into range of motion (ROM), balance, reaction time, and cervical motion velocity and accuracy. The majority of the studies were of moderate quality and provided evidence of VR adequate concurrent and, in some cases, known-groups validity. Also, VR showed high intra-rater reliability for most of the measured outcomes. SUMMARY: Based on the included studies, there is a limited promising evidence that interactive VR using games or real-time feedback is highly valid and reliable in assessing ROM in asymptomatic participants and patients with chronic neck pain and radial fracture.

METHODS: Eligible patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and the Department of Thyroid Surgery in West China Hospital of Sichuan University and who were diagnosed with stage IV C MTC were included in this study. The overall survival (OS), the cancer-specific survival (CSS) and the precise cause of MTC-induced death were analyzed. The potential risk factors, including the T stage, in the OS and CSS were evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. RESULTS: This retrospective study enrolled 204 stage IV C MTC patients. The 5-year and 10-year OS rates were 31.8% and 17.1%, respectively, and the 5-year and 10-year CSS rates were 40.4% and 22.5%, respectively. More importantly, the rates of MTC-induced death between primary or distant metastatic lesions in stage IV C MTC patients were comparable in our institution. Additionally, the univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the presence of an advanced T stage was an independent prognostic factor for both the OS (T4 vs T1-T3, HR: 1.714, 95% CI: 1.175-2.500, P=0.005) and the CSS (T4 vs T1-T3, HR: 1.848, 95% CI: 1.229-2.780, P=0.003).

Whilst this controls relapsing multiple sclerosis, it also inhibits seroconversion following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination unlike that seen following alemtuzumab and cladribine treatment. Emerging reports suggest that 1-3% B-cell repopulation facilitates seroconversion after CD20-depletion. Objective: To determine the frequency of B-cell repopulation levels during and after ocrelizumab treatment. Methods: Relapse data, lymphocyte and CD19 B-cell numbers were obtained following requests to clinical trial data-repositories. Information was extracted from the phase II ocrelizumab extension (NCT00676715) trial and the phase III cladribine tablet (NCT00213135) and alemtuzumab (NCT00530348/NCT00548405) trials obtained clinical trial data requests Results: Only 3-5% of people with MS exhibit 1% B-cells at 6 months after the last infusion following 3-4 cycles of ocrelizumab, compared to 50-55% at 9 months, and 85-90% at 12 months. During this time relapses occurred at consistent disease-breakthrough rates compared to people during standard therapy. In contrast most people (90-100%) exhibited more than 1% B-cells during treatment with either cladribine or alemtuzumab. Conclusions. Most people demonstrate B cell repletion within 3 months of the last treatment of alemtuzumab and cladribine. However, few people repopulate peripheral B-cells with standard ocrelizumab dosing. Controlled studies are warranted to examine a view that delaying the dosing interval by 3-6 months may allow more people to potentially seroconvert after vaccination.","output":"CD19 B cell repopulation after ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab and cladribine: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in multiple sclerosis()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 fatalities exemplify \\"bad deaths\\" and are distinguished by physical discomfort, difficulty breathing, social isolation, psychological distress, and care that may be discordant with the patient's preferences.

With increasing reliance on the internet and almost 2 million people in the United Kingdom being affected by vision loss, it is important that they are not overlooked when developing web-based materials. A significant proportion of those affected have irreversible vision loss due to rare genetic eye disorders, and many of them use the internet as a primary source of information for their conditions. However, access to high-quality web-based health information with an inclusive design remains a challenge for many. We have developed a new web-based resource for genetic eye disorders called Gene.Vision thataims to provide a holistic guide for patients, relatives, and health care professionals. OBJECTIVE: Through a usability testing session of our website prototype, this study aims to identify key web-based accessibility features for internet users with vision impairment and to explore whether the contents provided in Gene.Vision are relevant and comprehensible. METHODS: A face-to-face testing session with 8 participants (5 patients, 2 family members, and 1 member of the public) and 8 facilitators was conducted on a prototype website. Remote testing was performed with another patient due to COVID-19 restrictions. Home page design, navigation, content layout and quality, language, and readability were explored through direct observation and task completion using the think-aloud method. A patient focus group was organized to elicit further feedback. Qualitative data were gathered and analyzed to identify core themes through open and axial coding. RESULTS: All participants had good computer literacy; 6 patients with visual impairment used visual aid software including iOS VoiceOver and Speak Screen, iOS Classic Invert, ZoomText 2020, Job Access With Speech, and Nonvisual Desktop Access. The features identified by the participants that will enhance accessibility and usability for users with visual impairment were a consistent website layout, a structured information hierarchy with a clear description of links, good chromatic and luminance contrast, a simple home page with predictable and easy navigation, adaptability to various assistive software, and readable and relevant content. They reported that dynamic content (such as carousels) and large empty spaces reduced accessibility. Information on research, support available, practical advice, and links to charities were incentives for repeated website visits. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the importance of developing a website with a user-based approach. Through end user testing, we identified several key web-based accessibility features for people with visual impairment.

Only one participant with stroke was not comfortable using the videoconferencing technology. Implementation: The program was implemented as intended as evaluated by a fidelity checklist. Participants' adherence was high, as verified by the average attendance and practice time. Maintenance: The organization continued to offer the program. CONCLUSION: The virtual GRASP program was successfully implemented. Although the program was effective in improving both measured and perceived UE function in a small sample of individuals with stroke, caution should be taken in generalizing the results. IMPACT: Implementing telerehabilitation is crucial to optimize patient outcomes and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Our findings provide guidance on the process of delivering a UE rehabilitation program remotely via videoconferencing for stroke. Moreover, insights that arise from this study also inform the implementation of other telerehabilitation services.","output":"Implementation and Evaluation of the Virtual Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP) for Individuals With Stroke During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a pathophysiological process contributing to cellular damage in multiple ocular conditions, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vascular occlusions. Rodent models of I/R injury are providing significant insights into mechanisms and treatment strategies for human I/R injury, especially with regard to neurodegenerative damage in the retinal neurovascular unit. Presented here is a protocol for inducing retinal I/R injury in mice through elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). In this protocol, the ocular anterior chamber is cannulated with a needle, through which flows the drip of an elevated saline reservoir. Using this drip to raise IOP above systolic arterial blood pressure, a practitioner temporarily halts inner retinal blood flow (ischemia). When circulation is reinstated (reperfusion) by removal of the cannula, severe cellular damage ensues, resulting ultimately in retinal neurodegeneration. Recent studies demonstrate inflammation, vascular permeability, and capillary degeneration as additional elements of this model. Compared to alternative retinal I/R methodologies, such as retinal arterial ligation, retinal I/R injury by elevated IOP offers advantages in its anatomical specificity, experimental tractability, and technical accessibility, presenting itself as a valuable tool for examining neuronal pathogenesis and therapy in the retinal neurovascular unit.","output":"A Mouse Model of Retinal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Through Elevation of Intraocular Pressure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To report the multicenter retrospective experience on combination of balloon-occluded MWA(b-MWA) followed by balloon-occluded TACE(b-TACE) in patients with liver malignancies > 3 cm, focusing on appearance and volume of necrotic area, safety profile and oncological results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with liver primary malignancies (hepatocellular carcinoma,HCC = 18; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,iCC = 2) and metastasis (colorectal cancer metastasis = 1;sarcoma metastasis = 1;breast metastasis = 1) were treated. Maximum mean diameter of lesions was 4.4 cm ( 1 cm). Treatments were performed using a single-step approach:b-MWA was performed after balloon-microcatheter inflation, followed by b-TACE (with epirubicin or irinotecan). Necrotic area shape and discrepancy with the expected volume of necrosis suggested by vendor's ablation chart were assessed at post-procedural CT. Complications were categorized according to CIRSE classification. Oncological results at 1 and 3-6 months were evaluated using m-RECIST(HCC) and RECISTv1.1(metastasis/iCC). RESULTS: Mean volume of necrotic area was 75 cm3 ( 36). Discrepancy with vendor chart consisted in a medium percentage of volumetric incrementation of necrotic area of 103.2% ( 99.8). Non-spherical shape was observed in 22/23 patients (95.7%). No complications occurred; Post-embolization syndrome occurred in 12/23patients. Complete response and partial response were, respectively, 91, 3% (21/23) and 8.7% (2/23) at 1 month, 85.7% (18/21) and 9.5% (2/21) at 3-6 months. Progression of disease was 4.7% (1/21) at 3-6 months for extra-hepatic progression. Among partial responders, average percentage of tumor volume debulking was 78.8% ( 9.8%). CONCLUSION: b-MWA followed by b-TACE in a single-step procedure led to larger necrotic areas than the proposed by vendors ablation chart, non-spherical in shape and corresponded to the vascular segment occluded during ablation. This permitted to safely achieve promising oncological results in patients with > 3 cm tumors.","output":"Percutaneous Thermal Segmentectomy: Proof of Concept"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 1991 there has been a reinforcement of the World Market Economy, not least since China and the, then new Russian Federation have joined the World Trade Organization and because of EU Eastern enlargement and ASEAN integration deepening, while the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations seemed to indicate stronger regional integration dynamics.

STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational longitudinal cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive mothers and their infants at three NYU Langone Health hospitals from March 25, 2020 through May 30, 2020. Mothers were surveyed by telephone regarding pre-delivery feeding plans, in-hospital feeding, and home feeding of their neonates. Any change prompted an additional question to determine whether this change was due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 160 motherCnewborn dyads, 103 mothers were reached by telephone, and 85 consented to participate. No significant difference was observed in pre-delivery feeding plan between the separated and unseparated dyads (P = .268). Higher rates of breastfeeding were observed in the unseparated dyads compared with the separated dyads in the hospital (p<0.001), and at home (p=0.012). Only two mothers in each group reported expressed breast milk as the hospital feeding source (5.6% of unseparated vs 4.1% of separated). COVID-19 was more commonly cited as the reason for change among the separated compared with the unseparated group (49.0% vs 16.7%, p<0.001). When dyads were further stratified by symptom status into four groups (asymptomatic separated, asymptomatic unseparated, symptomatic separated, and symptomatic unseparated), results remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: In the setting of COVID-19, separation of motherCnewborn dyads impacts breastfeeding outcomes, with lower rates of breastfeeding both during hospitalization and at home following discharge compared with unseparated mothers and infants.

The genetic basis of human cancers was uncovered through the cloning of the tumor suppressor Rb gene. It encodes a nuclear DNA-binding protein whose self-interaction is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases. A 3D-structure of Rb dimer is shown, confirming its multimeric status. Rb assumes a central role in cell cycle regulation and the Rb pathway is universally inactivated in human cancers. Hyperploidy refers to a state in which cells contain one or more extra chromosomes. Hyperploid progression occurs due to continued cell-cycling without cytokinesis in G1 checkpoint-defective cancer cells. The evidence for the triggering of hyperploid progression-mediated death in RB-mutant human retinoblastoma cells is shown. Hence, the very genetic mutation that predisposes to cancer can be exploited to induce lethality.

The study aimed to investigate the effects of these tiered lockdowns on public online interest in food priorities in Thailanders. METHODS: The Google query's search volume related to food priorities were extracted from a duration of December 1, 2019, to February 1, 2021. Searches were conducted in Thai. A time-series analysis of structural change in linear regression models with Chow test was performed. RESULTS: Results revealed that when the official statement of COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdown were released, trending online searches in relation to foodstuff dramatically increased independently with the level of adopted restrictions. Examining 1-month lockdown period, the changes in search frequency were more likely to be greater in national hard than localized soft measures, with the magnitude of differences ranged from 10% to 30% depends on distinct keywords. The searches reached the highest volume within one to two weeks after the announcement. Interests in essential food items related to health motivation appeared with higher frequency such as vegetables, fruits, and legumes as well as main protein sources like fish, pork, chicken.

Background: Given the covid-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, to spare resources, have limited access to operating rooms for elective surgical activity, including cancer, thus forcing deferral or cancellation of cancer surgeries. Surgery for hepatobiliary cancer is high-risk and particularly resource-intensive. Surgeons must critically appraise which patients will benefit most from surgery and which ones have other therapeutic options to delay surgery. Little guidance is currently available about potential delaying strategies for hepatobiliary cancers when surgery is not possible. Methods: An international multidisciplinary panel reviewed the available literature to summarize data relating to standard-of-care surgical management and possible mitigating strategies to be used as a bridge to surgery for colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Outcomes of surgery during the covid-19 pandemic are reviewed. Resource requirements are summarized, including logistics and adverse effects profiles for hepatectomy and delaying strategies using systemic, percutaneous and radiation ablative, and liver embolic therapies. For each cancer type, the long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy and the clinical tools that can be used to prognosticate for individual patients are detailed. Conclusions: There are a variety of delaying strategies to consider if availability of operating rooms decreases. This review summarizes available data to provide guidance about possible delaying strategies depending on patient, resource, institution, and systems factors.

Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes.

These recommendations were based for the possible drug interactions between oral anticoagulants and the experimental coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies. However, not all direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have the same risk of drug-drug interactions. The metabolism of edoxaban by CYP3A4 is less than 4% being one of the DOACs that poses less of drug-drug interactions risk with the therapy used against the COVID-19 (http://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/). Unfortunately, the current information about the use of DOACs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection is very scarce. Objective To determine whether the effectiveness (major thromboembolic events) and safety (bleedings) of edoxaban or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) were different among patients with AF that had been hospitalized for COVID-19 infection in Catalonia, Spain. Methods Observational and multicenter study with a retrospective analysis that consecutively included from March 5th to April 27st 2020 hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of non-valvular AF who received anticoagulant treatment with LMWH or edoxaban concomitantly with the empirical therapy used for COVID-19 infection. The initiation or continuation of anticoagulant treatment with edoxaban was performed according to medical criteria and with close monitoring for possible interactions. The use of LMWH was carried out with therapeutic and intermediate doses. The minimum follow-up was 30 days or until death.

With regard to outcomes, mean duration of hospitalization was 14.67.2 days and mean total time of follow-up (since admission to last visit) was 31.613.4 days. 12.9% of patients required admission in the intensive care unit, 18.5% of patients died and 9.9% had a bleeding complication (34.8% major bleeding). Whereas peak mean D-dimer was higher in those patients taking LMWH (1691.72240.8 vs 3249.45146.3 g/L; P=0.003). Except for the duration of hospitalization that was longer in those patients taking LMWH (13.36.5 vs 16.07.7 days; P=0.005), the rest of outcomes similarly occurred in patients treated with edoxaban or LMWH (Table 1). Conclusions Approximately one out of 5 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with AF anticoagulated with edoxaban or LMWH died and one out of 10 presented a bleeding complication. Mortality rates, arterial and venous thromboembolic complications and bleedings did not significantly differ between groups. However, the duration of hospitalization was significantly lower with edoxaban. In our clinical practice, edoxaban had a similar therapeutic profile to LMWH and may provide additional benefit. Further studies are needed to determine whether the possible interaction between edoxaban and the antiviral treatment used empirically for COVID-19 is clinically relevant.

As the complex screening of athletes is essential for safe and successful sports, we aimed to repeat the 2019-year sports cardiology screening of the Olympic Swim Team before the Olympics and to compare the results of COVID and non-COVID athletes. Methods: Patient history, electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, body composition analysis, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were performed. We used time-ranking points to compare swimming performance. Results: From April 2019, we examined 46 elite swimmers (24  4 years). Fourteen swimmers had COVID infection; all cases were mild. During CPET there was no difference in the performance of COVID (male: VO(2) max 55  4 vs. 56.5  5 mL/kg/min, p = 0.53; female: VO(2) max 54.6  4 vs. 56  5.5 mL/kg/min, p = 0.86) vs. non-COVID athletes (male VO(2) max 56.7  5 vs. 55.5  4.5 mL/kg/min, p = 0.50; female 49.6  3 vs. 50.7  2.6 mL/kg/min, p = 0.47) between 2019 and 2021. When comparing the time results of the National Championships, 54.8% of the athletes showed an improvement (p = 0.75).

Little is known about the virus diversity in wild citrus species. Here, we used a metatranscriptomics approach to characterize the virus diversity in a wild citrus habitat within the proposed center of the origin of citrus plants. We discovered a total of 44 virus isolates that could be classified into species Citrus tristeza virus and putative species citrus associated ampelovirus 1, citrus associated ampelovirus 2, and citrus virus B within the family Closteroviridae, providing important information to explore the factors facilitating outbreaks of citrus viruses and the evolutionary history of the family Closteroviridae. We found that frequent horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and alteration of expression strategy have shaped the genome complexity and diversification of the family Closteroviridae. Recombination frequently occurred among distinct Closteroviridae members, thereby facilitating the evolution of Closteroviridae. Given the potential emergence of similar wild-citrus-originated novel viruses as pathogens, the need for surveillance of their pathogenic and epidemiological characteristics is of utmost priority for global citrus production.","output":"Viromics unveils extraordinary genetic diversity of the family Closteroviridae in wild citrus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is suitable for high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection risk people, foremost among whom are males who have sex with other males (MSM).

Substantial economic losses also affect shellfish growers during PSP events. The toxins responsible for PSP are produced by dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium. Despite the persistent threat posed by PSP and the long history of shellfish toxicity research, there is still confusion concerning the Alexandrium species that cause PSP in Alaska. The primary objective of this study was to identify the toxic Alexandrium species present in Alaska and to develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for use in screening phytoplankton and sediment samples. Before developing the PCR assays for this study, we evaluated published assays and many were not adequate because of primer dimer formation or because of cross-reactivity. Rather than continue to grapple with the uncertainty and inadequacy of published assays, we developed new assays for the Alexandrium species most likely to be present in Alaska. Only Alexandrium fundyense Group I and A. ostenfeldii were identified from four sampling regions from southeast Alaska to Kodiak Island, indicating that these two species are widely distributed. PCR assays for these two species were converted to quantitative (q)PCR format for use in monitoring programs. During the course of this study, we realized that a systematic evaluation of all published (~150) Alexandrium species-specific assays would be of benefit. Toward this objective, we collated published Alexandrium PCR, qPCR, and in situ hybridization assay primers and probes that targeted the small-subunit (SSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS/5.8S), or D1-D3 large-subunit (LSU) (SSU/ITS/LSU) ribosomal DNA genes. Each individual primer or probe was screened against the GenBank database and Alexandrium gene sequence alignments constructed as part of this study.

Through a prospective CSRV survey program conducted from 2016 onwards in allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients with respiratory symptoms, we aimed to analyze and compare the epidemiology and characteristics of CSRV over three consecutive periods [from February 1 to September 30 of 2018 (P1), 2019 (P2), and 2020 (P3)]. CSRV screening was performed through multiplex PCR assays during the study period. We identified 188 consecutive allo-HSCT recipients with 406 episodes screened for CSRV during the study period, of which 147 developed 300 CSRV. In P1 and P2 we diagnosed 115 (38.3%) and 145 (48.3%) CSRV episodes, respectively, whereas in P3 only 40 (13.3%) episodes were detected (p < 0.001). During P3, we observed a reduction of 80.2% in Ev/Rh, 93.3% in RSV, 80% in hIV, 96.3% HPIV, 68.4% in hMPV, 77.7% in ADV, 100% in HBoV, and 53.6% in HCoV as compared to P1 and P2.

The outbreak of Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) disease has increased demand for N95 respirators, surgical masks, and other facial coverings in an effort to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Research shows that N95 respirators perform the best at filtering viral droplets and aerosols, however these masks are much more difficult to manufacture and expensive to distribute on a large scale, which led to shortages during the early phases of the pandemic. Surgical masks, on the other hand, were more widely available and have been previously used to mitigate the spread of tuberculosis and influenza. However, surgical masks are not designed to filter aerosols because unlike the N95, they do not fit tightly around the nose and mouth, and often have reduced filtration efficiency. Objectives. To evaluate the filter filtration efficiency (FFE) of three elastomeric face harness designs in hospital and research settings in order to improve facemask seal and preserve comfort. Design, setting and participants. A multi-institutional collaboration between engineers and health professionals, conducted between November 2020 and March 2021, was set up to design an elastomeric harness to improve the face seal of a surgical mask. Three elastomeric harness designs were created with harness designs 1 and 2 tested in a research laboratory setting and harness design 2.1 tested in a hospital setting. The harness can be manufactured from a single sheet of elastomer and can be used with a surgical mask to provide a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture, reusable alternative to an N95 respirator. The initial harness design 1 was laser cut for testing and design 2 was developed to improve the detected particle leakage around the nose bridge area by introducing more material in that region. The extra material is looped multiple times and secured, forming a more secure seal between the nose and the surgical mask. Due to expressed discomfort levels and vision disruption, harness design 2.1 is developed for hospital settings with shorter looping material around the nose bridge. The designs were tested on mannequins and human volunteers using IR imaging and standard fit testing equipment to help optimize face seal and comfort. Main Outcomes and Measures. Our elastomeric harness can improve the seal of a surgical mask allowing it to pass the fit test used to evaluate N95 respirators. When tested with human volunteers we find that all participants fitted with an elastomeric harness increase their scores on the NIOSH fit test used to evaluate N95 aerosol filtration efficiency. Of this group, 24/39 participants achieved a passing score of 100 or more while wearing the second harness design. By studying the location of air leakage using IR imaging we were able to determine the nose bridge region of the masks is most prone to leakage when using our first elastomeric harness. Further optimization of the harness may increase the percentage of those who pass the NIOSH fitness test. Conclusions and Relevance. Overall, these results confirm that elastomeric harnesses combined with surgical masks improve their ability to filter aerosolized particles, which is especially important when in close proximity to individuals who are infectious or while performing aerosol-generating medical procedures.","output":"Elastomeric Harnesses Decrease Aerosol Particles Leak and Improve the Fit of Surgical Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is one of the major pathogens causing acute enteritis, which is characterised by vomiting and watery diarrhoea and commonly leads to high rates of mortality and morbidity in suckling piglets.

Here, we establish methods for inducing mitophagy by mitochondria-targeted ubiquitin chains and chemical-induced mitochondrial ubiquitination. Using these tools, we reveal that the ubiquitin signal is sufficient for mitophagy and that PINK1 and Parkin are unnecessary for autophagy activation per se. Furthermore, using phase-separated fluorescent foci, we show that the critical autophagy adaptor OPTN forms a complex with ATG9A vesicles. Disruption of OPTN-ATG9A interactions does not induce mitophagy. Therefore, in addition to binding ATG8 proteins, the critical autophagy adaptors also bind the autophagy core units that contribute to the formation of multivalent interactions in the de novo synthesis of autophagosomal membranes near ubiquitinated mitochondria.","output":"Critical role of mitochondrial ubiquitination and the OPTN-ATG9A axis in mitophagy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Human gut microbiota plays a crucial role in providing protective responses against pathogens, particularly by regulating immune system homeostasis.

We theorize that the diffusion of particular content on Twitter can be driven by a sequence of nouns, adjectives, adverbs forming a sentence. We exhibit that the proposed approach is coherent with the intrinsic disposition of tweets to a common choice of words while constructing a sentence to express an opinion or sentiment. Through this paper, we propose a Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE) to study the degree of diffusion of content (retweet on Twitter). Our framework first extracts the words, create a matrix of these words using the sequences in the tweet text. To this sequence matrix we further multiply custom weights basis the presence index in a sentence wherein higher weights are given if the impactful class of tokens/words like nouns, adjectives are used at the beginning of the sentence than at last. We then try to predict the possibility of diffusion of information using Long-Short Term Memory Deep Neural Network architecture, which in turn is further optimized on the accuracy and training execution time by a Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The results of the proposed CWWE are compared to a pre-trained glove word embedding. For experimentation, we created a corpus of size 230,000 tweets posted by more than 45,000 users in 6 months.

Blood cancer is an umbrella term for cancers that affect blood cells and organs of the hematopoietic system, accounting for approximately 10% of all cancer diagnoses. PTMs are crucial for the normal functioning of cells via the regulation of protein structure, function, and localization. Mass spectrometry and antibody-based techniques are powerful analytical tools used for the detection and quantitation of PTMs such as phosphorylation. The application of these techniques in blood cancer research facilitates the identification of abnormal PTMs that contribute to cancer development and progression by promoting cancer cell growth, survival, and invasion. Many FDA-approved blood cancer treatments exert their anti-cancer effects by targeting protein modifications, thus emphasizing the importance of PTM-focused research in the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve blood cancer survival outcomes. ABSTRACT: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) add a layer of complexity to the proteome through the addition of biochemical moieties to specific residues of proteins, altering their structure, function and/or localization. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques are at the forefront of PTM analysis due to their ability to detect large numbers of modified proteins with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. The low stoichiometry of modified peptides means fractionation and enrichment techniques are often performed prior to MS to improve detection yields. Immuno-based techniques remain popular, with improvements in the quality of commercially available modification-specific antibodies facilitating the detection of modified proteins with high affinity. PTM-focused studies on blood cancers have provided information on altered cellular processes, including cell signaling, apoptosis and transcriptional regulation, that contribute to the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of many blood cancer therapies, such as kinase inhibitors, involves inhibiting or modulating protein modifications. Continued optimization of protocols and techniques for PTM analysis in blood cancer will undoubtedly lead to novel insights into mechanisms of malignant transformation, proliferation, and survival, in addition to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review discusses techniques used for PTM analysis and their applications in blood cancer research.","output":"Current Methods of Post-Translational Modification Analysis and Their Applications in Blood Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Many proteomics-based and bioinformatics-based efforts are made to detect the molecular mechanism of COVID-19 infection Identification of the main protein targets and pathways of severe cases of COVID-19 infection is the aim of this study Methods: Published differentially expressed proteins were screened and the significant proteins were investigated via protein-protein interaction network using Cytoscape software V 3 7 2 and STRING database The studied proteins were assessed via action map analysis to determine the relationship between individual proteins using CluePedia The related biological terms were investigated using ClueGO and the terms were clustered and discussed Results: Among the 35 queried proteins, six of them (FGA, FGB, FGG, and FGl1 plus TLN1 and THBS1) were identified as critical proteins A total of 38 biological terms, clustered in 4 groups, were introduced as the affected terms \\"Platelet degranulation\\" and \\"hereditary factor I deficiency disease\\" were introduced as the main class of the terms disturbed by COVID-19 virus Conclusion: It can be concluded that platelet damage and disturbed haemostasis could be the main targets in severe cases of coronavirus infection It is vital to follow patients' condition by examining the introduced critical differentially expressed proteins (DEPs)","output":"Platelet and Haemostasis are the Main Targets in Severe Cases of COVID-19 Infection;a System Bioinformatics Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for a timely update of health policies and allocation of resources Particularly, serological testing may allow individuals with low-risk of being contagious of SARS-CoV-2 to return to daily activities Both private and academic initiatives have sought to develop serological assays to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies Herein, we compared five different assays in active healthcare personnel exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in a large center in Madrid, Spain, in a retrospective study Median time lapse between polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) and serological testing was 11 days (7-21) All tests assessed IgM/IgG titers except for Euroimmun (IgA/IgG) and The Binding-Site (IgA/IgM/IgG) The highest concordance rate was observed between Dia Pro and Euroimmun (75 76%), while it was lowest between The Binding-Site and Euroimmun (44 55%) The Binding-Site assay showed the highest concordance (85 52%) with PCR results Considering PCR results as reference, Dia Pro was the most sensitive test, although The Binding-Site assay exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC;0 85) OrientGene and MAGLUMI tests were performed in a smaller cohort with confirmed infection and thus were not adequate to estimate sensitivity and specificity The Binding-Site assay presented the best joint sensitivity and specificity among all the tests analyzed in our cohort Likewise, this serological assay presents a greater repertoire of antibodies and antigen-regions tested, which is why each individual's humoral immunity is more accurately reflected The better the immunity test, the most adequate the health strategy to take in terms of organization of consultations, surgery, and treatments in vulnerable patients The three antibody classes (IgG/IgM/IgA) were determined jointly, which translates to an economic impact on healthcare While their role in the protection status remains elusive, serological tests add a valuable tool in the early management of SARS-CoV-2 after known exposition","output":"Serological Tests in the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cardiovascular manifestations are an important cause of mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 infections.

Results: The study population included 15 patients, including 14 patients with CHB and 1 patient with 2:1 AV block. Syncope was the most common presentation. The clinical endpoint in the form of death was seen in 5 patients (33.3%), 3 patients reverted to sinus rhythm, and 7 patients required permanent pacemaker implantation. The markers of inflammation were raised in all patients; however trend towards more inflammation was seen in patients reaching the primary clinical endpoint. 3 out of 7 patients with narrow QRS rhythm reverted to normal sinus rhythm, while all 8 patients with broad complex QRS either died or required a permanent pacemaker insertion. Conclusion: Symptomatic bradyarrhythmia is associated with a high inflammatory state, and high mortality in COVID-19 infection and a transient conduction block in patients with narrow QRS rhythm may suggest local subclinical myocardial inflammation.","output":"Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, clinical management, and outcome data of symptomatic bradyarrhythmia in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The wide-variety of affected organ-systems associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the need for tissue-specific evaluation We compared placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative women in our hospital in New York City, which became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 While some limited studies have been published on placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women to date, this study, in addition to describing histomorphology, utilizes in-situ hybridization (ISH) for the S-gene encoding the spike-protein and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with the monoclonal-SARS-CoV-2 spike-antibody 1A9 for placental evaluation METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 51 singleton, third-trimester placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women and 25 singleton, third-trimester placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women were examined histomorphologically using the Amsterdam Criteria as well as with ISH and/or IHC Corresponding clinical findings and neonatal outcomes also were recorded While no specific histomorphologic changes related to SARS-CoV-2 were noted in the placentas, evidence of maternal/fetal vascular malperfusion was identified, with placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women significantly more likely to show villous agglutination (p=0 003) and subchorionic thrombi (p=0 026) than placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women No evidence of direct viral involvement was identified using ISH and IHC CONCLUSIONS: In this study, third trimester placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women were more likely to show evidence of maternal/fetal vascular malperfusion;however, no evidence of direct viral involvement or vertical transmission was noted by ISH and IHC","output":"Third Trimester Placentas of SARS-CoV-2-Positive Women: Histomorphology, including Viral Immunohistochemistry and in Situ Hybridization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Of paired serum samples of 196 cattle with respiratory disease from 37 herds which were tested for hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies against coronavirus (BCV) 185 of the first specimens and 190 of the second ones gave positive results.

Therefore the effects of CLX on gastric acid secretion, mucus secretion and gastric ulcer scores in rats were investigated. A total of 30 albino wistar rats were used for the study.

Recently OTT service providers are extending their service to video broadcasting. As a one type of video broadcasting, this paper covers multimedia streaming with multiple sources. Multimedia streaming with multiple sources has multiple sources, and receivers can select one specific source to watch the video from the source. Sources include cameras capturing different angles of same event or location, cameras in geographical locations, etc. For delivering video to rapidly increasing number of users, multimedia streaming with multiple sources system needs efficient and scalable delivery method. Tree-based Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking has been investigated as the delivery solution of multimedia streaming with multiple sources, and set-top boxes or mobile apps of OTT service can be used as peers connecting the subscriber of OTT service. However, the scalability of the tree-based P2P networking is limited by the out-degree of a tree that branches linearly with the number of users. Hence, this study proposes clustering peers based on the location proximity of the peers to enhance the scalability of the P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources. By clustering peers, one or more peers can be grouped into a virtual peer with an aggregated uplink/downlink capacity. This paper describes P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources and algorithms for the proposed clustering method. Two applications which are one-view multiparty video conferencing and multi-view video streaming are introduced, and considerations for applying the proposed method to the applications are also discussed. The experimental results show that location-proximity-based clustering is effective in achieving a scalable P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources by reducing the out-degree of a tree for the introduced applications. The proposed clustering leads improvement in the maximum achievable video bit rate, the average viewing video bit rate, and perceived delay.","output":"Location-proximity-based clustering method for peer-to-peer multimedia streaming services with multiple sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis.

Moreover, this study determined the correlation of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 20 European countries as of 20 May 2020. A significant negative correlation (p = 0.033) has been observed between mean vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases per one million population in European countries. However, the correlation of vitamin D with COVID-19 deaths of these countries was not significant. Some retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted. Several studies demonstrated the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. These include direct inhibition with viral replication or with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory ways. In the meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation has been shown as safe and effective against acute respiratory tract infections. Thus, people who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency during this global pandemic should consider taking vitamin D supplements to maintain the circulating 25(OH)D in the optimal levels 75-125 nmol/L.

Nine cases of diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the gravid uterus have been reported, most of which diffusely involved the myometrium. These vascular malformations are clinically significant, and may cause pronounced bleeding resulting in maternal or fetal demise. Thrombosis of cavernous hemangiomas of the uterus has been previously reported. We here report the first case in which a thrombosed cavernous hemangioma of the myometrium resulted in a fatal pulmonary embolism in a post-partum woman. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old obese African-American woman who had one pregnancy and was delivered of twins by cesarean section was admitted 1 week after the successful delivery. The 12-day clinical course included ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, systemic hypertension, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum, leukocytosis and asystole. A transabdominal ultrasound examination showed heterogeneous thickened and irregular products in the endometrial canal. The laboratory values were relevant for an increased prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, ferritin and a decrease in hemoglobin. The clinical cause of death was cited as acute respiratory distress syndrome. At autopsy, a 400g spongy, hemorrhagic uterus with multiple cystic spaces measuring approximately 0.5  0.4cm filled with thrombi within the myometrium was identified. Immunohistological examination with a CD31 stain for vascular endothelium associated antigen confirmed several endothelium-lined vessels, some of which contained thrombi. These histological features were consistent with cavernous hemangioma of the myometrium. A histological examination of the lungs revealed multiple fresh thromboemboli in small- and medium-sized pulmonary arteries in the right upper and lower lobes without organization, but with adjacent areas of fresh hemorrhagic infarction. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion in a pregnant or post-partum woman presenting with respiratory symptoms. Thrombosis of the cavernous hemangiomas of the gravid or post-partum uterus is a rare entity. This case is of interest because it indicates that this condition can be fatally complicated by embolization of the thrombi in the cavernous myometrial hemangiomas. Although delivery by conservative methods, as well as cesarean section, is possible without resorting to hysterectomy, occasionally, the consequences could be fatal as in this case.","output":"Myometrial cavernous hemangioma with pulmonary thromboembolism in a post-partum woman: a case report and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endothelium-derived steroidogenic factor (EDSF) is an endothelial peptide that stimulates aldosterone release from bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells. The regulation of aldosterone release by combinations of EDSF and angiotensin II (AII) or EDSF and ACTH was investigated. Endothelial cells (ECs) and EC-conditioned media (ECCM) increased aldosterone release from ZG cells, an activity attributed to EDSF. AII (10(?12) to 10(?8)m) and ACTH (10(?12) to 10(?9)m) also stimulated the release of aldosterone from ZG cells. The stimulation by AII, but not ACTH, was greatly enhanced when ZG cells were coincubated with ECs. AII was metabolized by ECs to peptides identified by mass spectrometry as angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin IV. There was very little metabolism of AII by ZG cells. Neither of these two AII metabolites altered aldosterone release from ZG cells, so they could not account for the enhanced response with ECs. AII-induced aldosterone release from ZG cells was enhanced by ECCM but not cell-free conditioned medium. This enhanced response was not due to increased EDSF release from ECs by AII. The synergistic effect of EDSF and AII was apparent when AII was added during or after the generation of ECCM and not observed when the AII component of the enhancement was blocked by the AII antagonist, losartan. These studies indicate that EDSF enhances the steroidogenic effect of AII. In the adrenal gland, ECs are in close anatomical relationship with ZG cells and may sensitize ZG cells to the steroidogenic action of AII by releasing EDSF.","output":"Endothelium-Derived Steroidogenic Factor Enhances Angiotensin II-Stimulated Aldosterone Release by Bovine Zona Glomerulosa Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Construction work is one of the most stressful occupations in the world, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this reality.

Both 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR recognized cell culture passaged isolates of 10 bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV), 5 calf diarrhea (CD) and 8 winter dysentery (WD) strains of BCV, but not transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus or bovine rotavirus. The sensitivity of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR was compared to that of an antigen-capture ELISA. The lowest detection limit of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR as determined by using tenfold serial dilutions of the BRCV 255 and 440 strains in BCV negative nasal swab suspensions from preexposure gnotobiotic calves was 2  10(4) and 2  10(2) TCID(50)/0.1 ml for each strain, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the antigen-capture ELISA as determined by using the same serially diluted samples was 1  10(6) TCID(50)/0.1 ml for each strain. Therefore, the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were 50 and 5000 times, respectively more sensitive than the antigen-capture ELISA to detect BRCV in nasal swab suspensions. To investigate in vivo cross-protection between the BRCV and CD or WD strains of BCV and to detect nasal and fecal shedding of BCV using the 1-step RT-PCR, nested PCR and antigen-capture ELISA, 6 colostrum-deprived and two gnotobiotic calves were inoculated with a BRCV, a CD or a WD strain of BCV and then challenged 3C4 weeks later with either BRCV, CD or WD strains of BCV. All calves developed diarrhea after inoculation and BCV antigen (ELISA) or RNA (RT-PCR) was detected in the diarrheic fecal samples or the corresponding nasal swab samples. In addition, low amounts of BCV were also detected only by nested PCR in the fecal and nasal swab samples before and after diarrhea. No respiratory clinical signs were observed during the entire experimental period, but elevated rectal temperatures were detected during diarrhea in the BCV-inoculated calves. All calves recovered from infection with the BRCV, CD, or WD strains of BCV were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either a heterologous or homologous strain of BCV.

These patients requiring renal replacement therapy like intermittent hemodialysis have a preponderance to go into severe clinical states. Hence, this study was planned to analyze the outcomes of such patients requiring dialysis and suffering from the COVID-19 disease. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to compare the outcomes of the COVID-19 patients requiring hemodialysis with those not requiring hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study was carried out between April 2020 and August 2020 at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital and included COVID-19 patients requiring hemodialysis at the time of admission and an equal number of controls matched for age and sex. RESULTS: The study included 271 COVID-19-positive patients requiring dialysis and 271 COVID-19-positive controls without the requirement of a dialysis matched for age and sex; 10.3% cases needed intensive care. There were 18.8% deaths in cases as opposed to 8.9% among controls. Multivariate analysis showed that advancing age (OR 2.6 in cases and 1.06 in controls) need for intensive care (OR 27.9 in cases and 331 in controls), and diabetes alone and with other comorbidities were significant predictors of mortality.

METHODS: Clinical and laboratory parameters and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to four hospitals in Kathmandu were retrospectively analyzed. Admitted COVID-19 cases with recorded D-dimer and definitive outcomes were included consecutively. D-dimer was measured using immunofluorescence assay and reported in Fibrinogen Equivalent Unit (g/ml). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the accuracy of D-dimer in predicting mortality, and to calculate the optimal cutoff value, based on which patients were divided into two groups and predictive value of D-dimer for mortality was measured. RESULTS: 182 patients were included in the study out of which 34(18.7%) died during the hospital stay. The mean admission D-dimer among surviving patients was 1.067 g/ml (1.705 g/ml), whereas that among patients who died was 3.208 g/ml (2.613 g/ml). ROC curve for D-dimer and mortality gave an area under the curve of 0.807 (95% CI 0.728C0.886, p<0.001). Optimal cutoff value for D-dimer was 1.5 g/ml (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 78.4%).

We utilize an integrated dataset of real-time mobile device location data involving 100 million devices in the contiguous United States (plus Alaska and Hawaii) from February 2, 2020 to May 30, 2020. Built upon the common human mobility metrics, we construct a Social Distancing Index (SDI) to evaluate peoples mobility pattern changes along with the spread of COVID-19 at different geographic levels. We find that both government orders and local outbreak severity significantly contribute to the strength of social distancing. As people tend to practice less social distancing immediately after they observe a sign of local mitigation, we identify several states and counties with higher risks of continuous community transmission and a second outbreak. Our proposed index could help policymakers and researchers monitor peoples real-time mobility behaviours, understand the influence of government orders, and evaluate the risk of local outbreaks.","output":"Quantifying human mobility behaviour changes during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a global pandemic, COVID-19 shows no sign of letting up.

The Portuguese case study suggests that enhancing social justice towards socio-economically vulnerable groups correlates with the prevention of the spread of COVID-19; these benefits to public health can be explained by the fact that those policies create social distancing and less exposure to the COVID-19 virus and other contagious diseases and also remove disincentives to the use of healthcare services.","output":"Social Justice for Public Health: The COVID-19 Response in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has become widespread within few months and it has lead to a dramatic loss for human life worldwide. This pandemic impacts tens of millions of deaths each day and the number of people were dead by covid-19 is gradually increasing throughout the globe. During this pandemic situation control, we tend to propose a future prediction using Machine Learning algorithms on the death rate, the number of recovered estimates and the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases reported within the next ten days. It is based on Machine Learning technique. This forecasting method will predict the upcoming number of COVID-19 cases. Here we use four standard models for forecasting includes linear Regression (LR), The Lowest Absolute and Selective Shrinking Operator (LASSO), Vector Assistance (SVM) and exponential smoothing (ES) will predict the number of COVID-19 cases in future. These four models make three predictions: the mortality rates, the number of newly affected COVID-19 cases and the cummulative number of recovered cases in the next 10 days. These methods are better used in the COVID-19 situation. Based upon the findings, it is a encouraging method to use these standard models in the current situation of COVID-19 spread. The analysis shows that among all the standard forecasting models, ES model performs best, then LR and LASSO which also performs well in predicting the new infected cases of corona, death rate and recovery cases. Whereas the results of SVM were very bad in all the prediction scenarios from the given covid-19 data set. The predictions made by these models relating to the current situation are accurate and will also be useful for future awareness of the future situation. This paper will be enhanced continuously and next we are planning to traverse the prediction methodology using the updated covid-19 data set and we will make use of the most precise and best Machine Learning models for forecasting in future. ? 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Accordingly, a multivariate regression analysis found a strong association between PMN-MDSC percentage and fatal outcome of the disease. The PMN-MDSC frequency was higher in non-survivors than survivors at the admission time, followed by a decreasing trend.

MethodsInitiated in July 2020, HEROES-RECOVER cohort provided socio-demographics and COVID-19 vaccination data. Using follow-up two surveys approximately three months apart, COVID-19 vaccine KAP, intention, and receipt was collected; the first survey categorized participants as reluctant, reachable, or endorsers. ResultsA total of 4,803 participants were included in the analysis. Most (70%) were vaccine endorsers, 16% were reachable, and 14% were reluctant. By May 2021, 77% had received at least one vaccine dose. KAP responses strongly predicted vaccine uptake, particularly positive attitudes about safety (aOR=5.46, 95% CI: 1.4-20.8) and effectiveness (aOR=5.0, 95% CI: 1.3-19.1). Participants prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were 22% less likely to believe the COVID-19 vaccine was effective compared with uninfected participants (aOR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.64-0.96). This was even more pronounced in first responders compared with other occupations, with first responders 42% less likely to believe in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (aOR=0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.84). KAP responses shifted positively, with reluctant and reachable participant scores modestly increasing in positive responses for perceived vaccine effectiveness (7% and 12%, respectively) on the second follow-up survey; 25% of initially reluctant participants received the COVID-19 vaccine. DiscussionOur study demonstrates attitudes associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake and a positive shift in attitudes over time. First responders, despite potential high exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and participants with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were more vaccine reluctant. ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccine KAP responses predicted vaccine uptake and associated attitudes improved over time. Perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine can shift over time.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has taken humanity off guard. Following an outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002, and MERS-CoV about 10 years later, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in less than 20 years to cross the species barrier and start spreading by human-to-human transmission. It is the most infectious of the three, currently causing the COVID-19 pandemic. No treatment has been approved for COVID-19. We previously proposed targets that can serve as binding sites for antiviral drugs for multiple coronaviruses, and here we set out to find current drugs that can be repurposed as COVID-19 therapeutics.Aim. To identify drugs against COVID-19, we performed an in silico virtual screen with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a critical enzyme for coronavirus replication.Methodology. Initially, no RdRP structure of SARS-CoV-2 was available. We performed basic sequence and structural analysis to determine if RdRP from SARS-CoV was a suitable replacement. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to generate multiple starting conformations that were used for the in silico virtual screen. During this work, a structure of RdRP from SARS-CoV-2 became available and was also included in the in silico virtual screen.Results. The virtual screen identified several drugs predicted to bind in the conserved RNA tunnel of RdRP, where many of the proposed targets were located. Among these candidates, quinupristin is particularly interesting because it is expected to bind across the RNA tunnel, blocking access from both sides and suggesting that it has the potential to arrest viral replication by preventing viral RNA synthesis. Quinupristin is an antibiotic that has been in clinical use for two decades and is known to cause relatively minor side effects.Conclusion. Quinupristin represents a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic.

We examined patterns in and reasons for seeking and receiving online telemedicine abortion outside the jurisdiction following legalisation and introduction of telemedicine abortion. METHODS Quantitative analysis compared frequency of contact, completed requests, service user characteristics and reasons for contacting Women on Web (WoW). Statistical analyses assessed if COVID-19 restrictions and the implementation of telemedicine abortion locally impacted on WoW contact patterns. Thematic analysis of email correspondence analysed reasons for seeking online telemedicine abortion. RESULTS There were 764 requests from Ireland to WoW in 2019-2020, with 225 (29.5%) completed. Requests declined by 90 (21%) between 2019 and 2020, and proportion of completed requests declined by 11.3% (n=70). During COVID-19 restrictions, the proportion of completed requests decreased even more (25%, n=24). Legal restrictions and cost declined as reasons for seeking online telemedicine and childcare, work/study commitments and being with partner/friend increased. During COVID-19 an abusive partner increased as the cited reason. Barriers cited in email correspondence included lack of proximate provider, not qualifying due to legal status and difficulty participating in consultations due to an abusive partner.

Increasing awareness of abortion provision, particularly access pathways, free cost and confidentiality, promoting normalisation and retaining local telemedicine can reduce reliance on online telemedicine. Extending the format of local telemedicine abortion to include text-based contact could alleviate how an abusive partner impedes access.","output":"Seeking online telemedicine abortion outside the jurisdiction from Ireland following implementation of telemedicine provision locally."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that resulted in a global pandemic with substantial morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19. The underlying associated comorbidity and diminished immune function of some pituitary patients (whether caused by the disease and its sequelae or treatment with excess glucocorticoids) increases their risk of contracting and developing complications from COVID-19 infection. Methods: A review of studies in PubMed and Google Scholar published between January 2020 to the time of writing (May 1, 2020) was conducted using the search terms pituitary, coronavirus, COVID-19, 2019-nCoV, diabetes mellitus, obesity, adrenal, and endocrine. Results: Older age and pre-existing obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. Men tend to be more severely affected than women; fortunately, most men, particularly of younger age, survive the infection. In addition to general comorbidities that may apply to many pituitary patients, they are also susceptible due to the following pituitary disorderCspecific features: hypercortisolemia and adrenal suppression with Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus with hypopituitarism, and sleep-apnea syndrome and chest wall deformity with acromegaly. Conclusion: This review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 in patients with pituitary disorders. As most countries are implementing mobility restrictions, we also discuss how this pandemic has affected patient attitudes and impacted our decision-making on management recommendations for these patients.

The conserved mRNA-capping process enables CoVs to evade their host immune system and is a target for antiviral development. Nonstructural protein (nsp) 16 in complex with nsp10 catalyzes the final step of coronaviral mRNA capping through its 2'-O-methylation activity. Like other methyltransferases, the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex is druggable. However, the availability of an optimized assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) is an unmet need. Here, we report the development of a radioactivity-based assay for the methyltransferase activity of the nsp10-nsp16 complex in a 384-well format, kinetic characterization, and optimization of the assay for HTS (Z' factor = 0.83). Considering the high conservation of nsp16 across known CoV species, the potential inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex may also be effective against other emerging pathogenic CoVs.","output":"A High-Throughput Radioactivity-Based Assay for Screening SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 Complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 is critical to implementing evidence-based strategies to address the COVID-19 global pandemic. Expanding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic ability beyond well-equipped laboratories widens the opportunity for surveillance and control efforts. However, such advances are predicated on the availability of rapid, scalable, accessible, yet high-performance diagnostic platforms. Methods to detect viral RNA using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) show promise as rapid and field-deployable tests; however, the per-unit costs of the required diagnostic hardware can be a barrier for scaled deployment. Here, we describe a diagnostic hardware configuration for LAMP technology, named the FABL-8, that can be built for approximately US$380 per machine and provide results in under 30 min. Benchmarking showed that FABL-8 has a similar performance to a high-end commercial instrument for detecting fluorescence-based LAMP reactions. Performance testing of the instrument with RNA extracted from a SARS-CoV-2 virus dilution series revealed an analytical detection sensitivity of 50 virus copies per microliter-a detection threshold suitable to detect patient viral load in the first few days following symptom onset. In addition to the detection of SARS-CoV-2, we show that the system can be used to detect the presence of two bacterial pathogens, demonstrating the versatility of the platform for the detection of other pathogens. This cost-effective and scalable hardware alternative allows democratization of the instrumentation required for high-performance molecular diagnostics, such that it could be available to laboratories anywhere-supporting infectious diseases surveillance and research activities in resource-limited settings.","output":"Low-Cost, Open-Source Device for High-Performance Fluorescence Detection of Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification Reactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In viruses, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are essential for their life cycle. Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for a better understanding of the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, we developed the first comprehensive viral posttranslational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of PTMs in human viruses and infected host cells. The VPTMdb contains 1240 unique viral PTM sites with 8 modification types from 43 viruses (818 experimentally verified PTM sites manually extracted from 150 publications and 422 PTMs extracted from SwissProt) as well as 13 650 infected cells' PTMs extracted from seven global proteomics experiments in six human viruses. The investigation of viral PTM sequences motifs showed that most viral PTMs have the consensus motifs with human proteins in phosphorylation and five cellular kinase families phosphorylate more than 10 viral species. The analysis of protein disordered regions presented that more than 50% glycosylation sites of double-strand DNA viruses are in the disordered regions, whereas single-strand RNA and retroviruses prefer ordered regions. Domain-domain interaction analysis indicating potential roles of viral PTMs play in infections. The findings should make an important contribution to the field of virus-human interaction. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylation sites.

The present study evaluated sleep patterns, sleep disturbances, and associated factors in Chinese preschoolers confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. Caregivers of 1619 preschoolers (aged 4-6 years) recruited from 11 preschools in Zunyi, Guizhou province completed the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) between 17th and 19th February 2020. Data were compared to a sociodemographically similar sample of preschoolers (included in the 11 preschools) in 2018. Compared to the 2018 sample, the confined preschoolers demonstrated changes in sleep patterns characterized by later bedtimes and wake times, longer nocturnal and shorter nap sleep durations, comparable 24-hr sleep duration, and fewer caregiver-reported sleep disturbances. Moreover, behavioural practices (sleeping arrangement, reduced electronic device use, regular diet) and parenting practices (harmonious family atmosphere and increased parent-child communication) were associated with less sleep disturbances in the confined sample. The present study provides the first description of the impact of prolonged home confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep patterns and sleep disturbances in preschoolers, as well as highlighting the importance of the link between sleep health and family factors. Given that disrupted and insufficient sleep has been linked to immune system dysfunction, our findings also have potential implications for resilience to infection in young children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the publication of many research papers reporting CPI predictors in the recent years, we have observed a number of fundamental issues in experiment design that lead to over optimistic estimates of model performance. Results: In this paper, we analyze the impact of several important factors affecting generalization perfor-mance of CPI predictors that are overlooked in existing work: 1. Similarity between training and test examples in cross-validation 2. The strategy for generating negative examples, in the absence of experimentally verified negative examples. 3. Choice of evaluation protocols and performance metrics and their alignment with real-world use of CPI predictors in screening large compound libraries. Using both an existing state-of-the-art method (CPI-NN) and a proposed kernel based approach, we have found that assessment of predictive performance of CPI predictors requires careful con-trol over similarity between training and test examples. We also show that random pairing for gen-erating synthetic negative examples for training and performance evaluation results in models with better generalization performance in comparison to more sophisticated strategies used in existing studies. Furthermore, we have found that our kernel based approach, despite its simple design, exceeds the prediction performance of CPI-NN. We have used the proposed model for compound screening of several proteins including SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Human ACE2 proteins and found strong evidence in support of its top hits.

However, Differential diagnosis remains difficult for suspected cases of COVID-19 and need to be improved to reduce misdiagnosis. METHODS: Sixty-eight cases of suspected COVID-19 treated in Wenzhou Central Hospital from January 21 to February 20, 2020 were divided into confirmed and COVID-19-negative groups based on the results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid testing of the novel coronavirus in throat swab specimens to compare the clinical symptoms and laboratory and imaging results between the groups. RESULTS: Among suspected patients, 17 were confirmed to COVID-19-positive group and 51 were distinguished to COVID-19-negative group. Patients with reduced white blood cell (WBC) count were more common in the COVID-19-positive group than in the COVID-19-negative group (29.4% vs 3.9%, P = 0.003). Subsequently, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between WBC count and temperature in the COVID-19-positive patients (r = ? 0.587, P = 0.003), instead of the COVID-19-negative group. But reduced lymphocyte count was no different between the two groups (47.1% vs 25.5%, P = 0.096). More common chest imaging characteristics of the confirmed COVID-19 cases by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) included ground-glass opacities (GGOs), multiple patchy shadows, and consolidation with bilateral involvement than COVID-19-negative group (82.4% vs 31.4%, P = 0.0002; 41.2% vs 17.6% vs P = 0.048; 76.5% vs 43.1%, P = 0.017; respectively). The rate of clustered infection was higher in COVID-19-positive group than COVID-19-negative group (64.7% vs 7.8%, P = 0.001). Through multiplex PCR nucleic acid testing, 2 cases of influenza A, 3 cases of influenza B, 2 cases of adenovirus, 2 cases of Chlamydia pneumonia, and 7 cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were diagnosed in the COVID-19-negative group. CONCLUSIONS: WBC count inversely correlated with the severity of fever, GGOs, multiple patchy shadows, and consolidation in chest HRCT and clustered infection are common but not specific features in the confirmed COVID-19 group.

The mutated Variants of Concern (VoC) and Variants of Interest (VoI) has acquired non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in Spike (S), ORF1a, ORF1b, Nucleocapsid (N), Membrane (M), Envelope (E), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF3a and ORF8 regions exhibiting more virulence and higher transmission rate. The S gene displaying nucleotide polymorphisms are studied for identification of major SARS CoV-2 variants circulating in India using in silico PCR-RFLP analysis. Methods & Materials DNA sequences of major SARS CoV-2 variants [alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), delta (B.1.617.2), epsilon (B.1.429+B.1.427), eta (B.1.525) and zeta (P.2)] prevailing in India retrieved from GISAID database were annotated using VIPR-VIGOR4 genome annotator tool. The S gene of variants were aligned using CLUSTALW algorithm in MEGA-X with default parameters and analyzed for sequence identity using Geneious Prime v2019.2.1. Primers were designed using Primer-BLAST tool, proof-read using FastPCR v6.7.46 and PCR-amplified using Snapgene v.3.2.1. Unique restriction sites in S amplicons of each variant were subjected to online Restriction Analyzer tool. The S amplicons were digested with restriction endonucleases and the band profile of each variant were visualized in the gel simulation tool using Snapgene v.3.2.1. Results The percentage of identical sites present in S region among SARS CoV-2 variants was found to be 98.6%. The amplified products were in the length of 3,689 and 3,698 bp. Out of 400 restriction endonucleases identified, 14 buffer-compatible enzymes were selected for single-step restriction digestion to generate unique RFLP profiles for each variant. The BsaXI-XcmI-AcuI triple digest showed unique banding pattern identifiers on 2% agarose gel for individual variants including alpha, eta, delta and zeta. The ApaLI-BsaI double digest produced distinct band profiles for beta and epsilon variants. Conclusion Our study strongly suggests PCR-RFLP analysis of Spike region can differentiate major SARS CoV-2 variants that are circulating in India.

This study is primarily aimed at acknowledging the role of the social cognitive theory's development in explaining and predicting the panic-buying behavior of Indonesian citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of the theory is attained by combining emotions and subjective norms to predict the panic-buying behavior intention in Indonesia. Using a purposive sampling technique, the sample size consists of 350 respondents from various areas, such as Jakarta, Tangerang, and Banten. An online survey was performed as the data collection method. Social desirabilit response (SDR) test was also conducted by this study to guarantee the naturality of the replies from the respondents. Data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with a two-stage approach. The result demonstrated that emotions have the highest impact on the panic-buying behavioral intention. Further, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and social outcome expectancies have the second, third, and fourth highest impacts on panic-buying behavior, respectively. In general, the social cognitive theory model developed in this study can understand, explain, and predict panic-buying behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Indonesia.

Even more will succumb as COVID-19 continues to spread. Moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other COVID-19-related challenges.

The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (triple quadrupole) (LC-MS/MS). To detect Phase II metabolites, the samples were reanalyzed after pre-treatment with -glucuronidase/arylsulfatase. The most prevalent mycotoxin was ochratoxin A (OTA) in all groups of children, before and after enzyme treatment. In healthy children, the incidence of OTA was 92.5% in both cases and higher than in sick children before (36.7% in digestive disorders, 50% in ASD, and 14.3% in ADHD) and also after the enzymatic treatment (76.6 % in digestive disorders, 50% in ASD, and 85.7% in ADHD). OTA levels increased in over 40% of healthy children after enzymatic treatment, and this increase in incidence and levels was also observed in all sick children. This suggests the presence of OTA conjugates in plasma. In addition, differences in OTA metabolism may be assumed. OTA levels are higher in healthy children, even after enzymatic treatment (mean OTA value for healthy children 3.29 ng/mL, 1.90 ng/mL for digestive disorders, 1.90 ng/mL for ASD, and 0.82 ng/mL for ADHD). Ochratoxin B appears only in the samples of healthy children with a low incidence (11.4%), always co-occurring with OTA. Sterigmatocystin (STER) was detected after enzymatic hydrolysis with a high incidence in all groups, especially in sick children (98.7% in healthy children and 100% in patients). This supports glucuronidation as a pathway for STER metabolism in children.

Our aim in this study is to determine which scoring system is most useful in determining disease severity and to guide clinicians. We classified the patients into two groups according to the stage of the disease (severe and non-severe) and adopted interim guidance of the World Health Organization. Severe cases were divided into a group of surviving patients and a deceased group according to the prognosis. According to admission values, the BCRSS, qSOFA, SOFA, MuLBSTA, and HScore were evaluated at admission using the worst parameters available in the first 24 h. Of the 417 patients included in our study, 46 (11%) were in the severe group, while 371 (89%) were in the non-severe group. Of these 417 patients, 230 (55.2%) were men.

Prior studies have shown that younger adults are more likely to consider the opinions of age-based in-group members relative to out-group members. However, the cause of this priority is still unknown. We conducted three independent studies to explore the effect of intergenerational contact on younger adults PT toward older adults and the possible roles of stereotyping and intergroup anxiety. A total of 192 college students completed the Perspective taking Scale in Study 1 after being primed with age-based intergroup relationships. The results indicated that younger adults found it more difficult to take the perspective of older adults than that of their peers. 200 college students completed the Prior Contact Scale, Intergroup Anxiety Scale, Negative Stereotype Scale, and PT Scale in Study 2. The results demonstrated that intergenerational contact improved PT toward older adults by disrupting negative stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety moderated this mediating relationship. A total of 215 college students completed the PT Scale in the context of imagining intergenerational contact in Study 3. Interestingly, imagined contact effectively increased younger adults ability to take older adults perspectives. The present research verifies that contact is important for influencing younger adults emotional (intergroup anxiety) and attitudinal (stereotyping) factors that are critical to improving younger adults ability to take older peoples perspectives.

DESIGN We analyzed prospectively collected data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. National Early Warning Score was collected daily during the trial, Modified Early Warning Score was calculated, and age applied to both scores. We assessed prognostic value for the end points of recovery, mechanical ventilation, and death for score at enrollment, average, and slope of score over the first 48 hours. SETTING A multisite international inpatient trial. PATIENTS A total of 1,062 adult nonpregnant inpatients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial 1 randomized participants to receive remdesivir or placebo. The prognostic value of predictive scores was evaluated in both groups separately to assess for differential performance in the setting of remdesivir treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS For mortality, baseline National Early Warning Score and Modified Early Warning Score were weakly to moderately prognostic (c-index, 0.60-0.68), and improved with addition of age (c-index, 0.66-0.74). For recovery, baseline National Early Warning Score and Modified Early Warning Score demonstrated somewhat better prognostic ability (c-index, 0.65-0.69); however, National Early Warning Score+age and Modified Early Warning Score+age further improved performance (c-index, 0.68-0.71). For deterioration, baseline National Early Warning Score and Modified Early Warning Score were weakly to moderately prognostic (c-index, 0.59-0.69) and improved with addition of age (c-index, 0.63-0.70). All prognostic performance improvements due to addition of age were significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial 1 cohort, National Early Warning Score and Modified Early Warning Score demonstrated moderate prognostic performance in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019, with improvement in predictive ability for National Early Warning Score+age and Modified Early Warning Score+age. Area under receiver operating curve for National Early Warning Score and Modified Early Warning Score improved in patients receiving remdesivir versus placebo early in the pandemic for recovery and mortality.

Then, NO2 levels were compared during these three periods to the same time frame in 2019. Our results show that the lockdowns in the 12 major U.S. counties analyzed led to a significant decline in NO2 levels, with an average reduction of 28.7% (+/- 14.6%) and 17.6% (+/- 10.9%) during peak lockdown and loosening lockdown periods, respectively.","output":"The impact of COVID-19-induced lockdowns during spring 2020 on nitrogen dioxide levels over major American counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methods for tracking RNA inside living cells without perturbing their natural interactions and functions are critical within biology and, in particular, to facilitate studies of therapeutic RNA delivery. We present a stealth labeling approach that can efficiently, and with high fidelity, generate RNA transcripts, through enzymatic incorporation of the triphosphate of tCO, a fluorescent tricyclic cytosine analogue. We demonstrate this by incorporation of tCO in up to 100% of the natural cytosine positions of a 1.2 kb mRNA encoding for the histone H2B fused to GFP (H2B:GFP). Spectroscopic characterization of this mRNA shows that the incorporation rate of tCO is similar to cytosine, which allows for efficient labeling and controlled tuning of labeling ratios for different applications. Using live cell confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we show that the tCO-labeled mRNA is efficiently translated into H2B:GFP inside human cells. Hence, we not only develop the use of fluorescent base analogue labeling of nucleic acids in live-cell microscopy but also, importantly, show that the resulting transcript is translated into the correct protein. Moreover, the spectral properties of our transcripts and their translation product allow for their straightforward, simultaneous visualization in live cells. Finally, we find that chemically transfected tCO-labeled RNA, unlike a state-of-the-art fluorescently labeled RNA, gives rise to expression of a similar amount of protein as its natural counterpart, hence representing a methodology for studying natural, unperturbed processing of mRNA used in RNA therapeutics and in vaccines, like the ones developed against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Stealth Fluorescence Labeling for Live Microscopy Imaging of mRNA Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Echolocating bats possess remarkable capability of multitarget spatial localization and micromotion sensing in a full field of view (FFOV) even in cluttered environments.

Seventy-eight patients were included, with fourteen cases (18%) requiring conversions to veno-arterial (V-A) or hybrid ECMO. The reasons for the ECMO mode configuration change were inadequate drainage (35.7%), inadequate perfusion (14.3%), myocardial infarction (7.1%), hypovolemic shock (14.3%), cardiogenic shock (14.3%) and septic shock (7.1%).

The aim of this study is to evaluate prognostic efficiency RDW, NLR, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for mortality prediction in respiratory patients with VAP. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients mechanically ventilated and developed VAP were included. Clinical characteristics and SOFA score on the day of admission and at diagnosis of VAP, RDW, and NLR were assessed and correlated to mortality. The average age of patients was 58.80  10.53. These variables had a good diagnostic performance for mortality prediction AUC 0.811 for SOFA at diagnosis of VAP, 0.777 for RDW, 0.728 for NLR, and 0.840 for combined of NLR and RDW. The combination of the three parameters demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance (AUC 0.889). A positive correlation was found between SOFA at diagnosis of VAP and RDW (r = 0.446, P < 0.000) and with NLR (r = 0.220, P < 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: NLR and RDW are non-specific inflammatory markers that could be calculated quickly and easily via routine hemogram examination. These markers have comparable prognostic accuracy to severity scores. Consequently, RDW and NLR are simple, yet promising markers for ICU physicians in monitoring the clinical course, assessment of organ dysfunction, and predicting mortality in mechanically ventilated patients.

Twenty-one residents (10 curriculum, 11 conventional) completed the surgical procedure-based assessment in the operating room (September to December 2013). Our primary outcome indicated that curriculum-trained residents displayed superior performance at laparoscopic salpingectomy (P = .043). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that curriculum-trained residents had higher performance scores on the cognitive multiple-choice questions (P < .001), the nontechnical skills multiple-choice questions (P = .016), box trainer task time (P < .001), and all virtual reality simulator parameters.

Methods: SEIR dynamics model was used to fit daily onset infections to search the start date of this resurgent COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing. The number of cumulative infections from June 12 to July 1 in Beijing were fitted considering different levels of control strength. Results: The current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing probably started between May 22 and May 28 (cumulative probability: 95%), with the highest probability on May 25 (23%). The R(0) of the current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic was 4.22 (95%CI: 2.88-7.02). Dynamic model fitting suggested that by June 11, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reached 99 (95%CI: 77-121), which was in line with the actual situation, and without control, by July 1, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reach 65 090 (95%CI: 39 068-105 037). Since June 12,comprehensive prevention and control measures have been implemented in Beijing, as of July 1,compared with uncontrolled situation, the number of infections had been reduced by 99%, similar to the fitting result of a 95% reduction of the transmission rate. The sensitivity analysis showed consistent results. Conclusions: For the emergent outbreak of COVID-19, the dynamics model can be used to infer the start time of the transmission and help tracing the source of epidemic. The comprehensive prevention and control measures taken in Beijing have quickly blocked over 95% of the transmission routes and reduced 99% of the infections, containing the sudden epidemic timely and effectively,which have value in guiding the prevention and control of the epidemic in the future.","output":"[Inference of start time of resurgent COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing with SEIR dynamics model and evaluation of control measure effect]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The question whether cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) visible on MRI in acute stroke increase the risk for intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) or worse outcome after thrombolysis is unresolved. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of CMB detected with pretreatment susceptibility-weighted MRI on ICH occurrence and outcome. METHODS From 2010 to 2013 we treated 724 patients with intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular therapy, or intravenous thrombolysis followed by endovascular therapy. A total of 392 of the 724 patients were examined with susceptibility-weighted MRI before treatment. CMBs were rated retrospectively. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine the impact of CMB on ICH and outcome. RESULTS Of 392 patients, 174 were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, 150 with endovascular therapy, and 68 with intravenous thrombolysis followed by endovascular therapy. CMBs were detected in 79 (20.2%) patients. Symptomatic ICH occurred in 21 (5.4%) and asymptomatic in 75 (19.1%) patients, thereof 61 (15.6%) bleedings within and 35 (8.9%) outside the infarct. Neither the existence of CMB, their burden, predominant location nor their presumed pathogenesis influenced the risk for symptomatic or asymptomatic ICH. A higher CMB burden marginally increased the risk for ICH outside the infarct (P=0.048; odds ratio, 1.004; 95% confidence interval, 1.000-1.008). CONCLUSIONS CMB detected on pretreatment susceptibility-weighted MRI did not increase the risk for ICH or worsen outcome, even when CMB burden, predominant location, or presumed pathogenesis was considered. There was only a small increased risk for ICH outside the infarct with increasing CMB burden that does not advise against thrombolysis in such patients.","output":"Preexisting cerebral microbleeds on susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and post-thrombolysis bleeding risk in 392 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We propose a compartmental mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19 disease with special focus on the transmissibility of super-spreaders individuals.

The raising mortality rate highlighted the necessity to identify the most susceptible populations, such as pregnant women and their fetuses, in order to protect them. Few studies have been conducted trying to identify maternal-neonatal outcomes among pregnant patients affected by COVID 19. In this scenario, this study aims to analyse poor maternal-neonatal outcomes in pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This was a double-centre, 5 months retrospective analysis conducted in Italy. The study population consisted of pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed by Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: 145 pregnant women affected by confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Among them, 116 (80%) were symptomatic and 29 (20%) were asymptomatic. Up to half of the patients (n = 111; 76.5%) had a past history of respiratory disease. The mean gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks  5 days, while the mean maternal age was 31.5  5.63. Reactive C protein (CRP) serum levels were higher than the normal range corresponding to a mean value of 56.93  49.57 mg/L. The mean interval between the diagnosis of maternal COVID-19 infection and the delivery was 8.5 days. With regard to the type of delivery, the percentage of patients who delivered vaginally was higher than those who experienced a caesarean section. (74.4% vs 25.6%). The percentage of term birth was higher than preterm one (62% vs 38%). Finally, the percentages of maternal and neonatal death were found to be 5% and 6%, respectively; similarly, the percentage of the infection vertical transmission was 5%. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in pregnant women seems to negatively affect both maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, it is important to emphasize that most of the cases of maternal death occurred in patients with severe symptoms and highly altered parameters related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, the sheer data volume generated by this high-capacity screening technique also creates a fundamental challenge towards efficiently analyzing these complex datasets and translating findings for the clinic. We address the new analytical considerations brought forth by aptamers, explore the necessary statistical analysis needed, and create a baseline to analyze these large-scale databases more comprehensively. In addition, we explore how aptamers can co-exist with current proteomic platforms to produce more robust findings in an evolving, multi-faceted approach towards the field. Unlocking the underlying signals masquerading behind these large datasets will ultimately empower clinicians and researchers to better understand diseases of interest and to curate more robust findings for patient care. ABSTRACT: The development and advancement of aptamer technology has opened a new realm of possibilities for unlocking the biocomplexity available within proteomics. With ultra-high-throughput and multiplexing, alongside remarkable specificity and sensitivity, aptamers could represent a powerful tool in disease-specific research, such as supporting the discovery and validation of clinically relevant biomarkers. One of the fundamental challenges underlying past and current proteomic technology has been the difficulty of translating proteomic datasets into standards of practice. Aptamers provide the capacity to generate single panels that span over 7000 different proteins from a singular sample. However, as a recent technology, they also present unique challenges, as the field of translational aptamer-based proteomics still lacks a standardizing methodology for analyzing these large datasets and the novel considerations that must be made in response to the differentiation amongst current proteomic platforms and aptamers. We address these analytical considerations with respect to surveying initial data, deploying proper statistical methodologies to identify differential protein expressions, and applying datasets to discover multimarker and pathway-level findings. Additionally, we present aptamer datasets within the multi-omics landscape by exploring the intersectionality of aptamer-based proteomics amongst genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, alongside pre-existing proteomic platforms. Understanding the broader applications of aptamer datasets will substantially enhance current efforts to generate translatable findings for the clinic.","output":"Analytical Considerations of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Datasets for Translational Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physically active children have lower rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and depression than their inactive counterparts, and further evidence suggests that integrating physical activity breaks into the school day improves children's classroom behavior, fitness, and cognitive functions.

Depression was associated with more frequent alcohol use now compared to before the pandemic, while anxiety and lower resilience were associated with less frequent cannabis use now. Lower resilience was associated changes in methamphetamine use. Depression was associated with using more frequently for enjoyment and to alleviate loneliness following the pandemic, and anxiety was associated with using earlier in the day and to alleviate boredom.

In May 2019, a dedicated weekly ILD clinic was established at the Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center. We performed a retrospective chart review to assess whether the ILD clinic improved adherence to guideline-based metrics in veterans with IPF. METHODS: A list of all patients on antifibrotic therapy, reflecting most individuals with IPF at our medical center, was obtained from the pharmacy. We then performed a chart-based retrospective review comparing the frequency of guideline-recommended monitoring and discussions performed for patients seen in ILD clinic compared to the general pulmonary clinic. The ILD clinic consisted of a dedicated Pulmonologist and Respiratory Therapist. Each new patient seen in the clinic completed an extensive medical, exposure and family history. A 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and bedside spirometry was attempted every patient visit. Charts from May 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 were reviewed, reflecting the period from when ILD clinic was initiated until usual clinic operations were halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 20 IPF patients were identified;7 were followed in the ILD clinic while the remaining 13 were seen in general pulmonary clinic. Individuals followed in the ILD clinic had closer monitoring of end points used to monitor for disease progression, such as spirometry and 6MWT, with both occurring every 6 months in 85.7% of patients. In the general pulmonary clinic, 46% had PFTs every 6 months while none had 6MWT every 6 months. Of the IPF patients seen in the ILD clinic, 100% underwent screening for sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease and hypoxia, while 46.2%, 84.6% and 76.9% respectively were screened in general pulmonary clinic. ILD clinic patients also had discussions regarding pulmonary rehab and goals of care, 100% and 42.9% of the time compared to 23% and 38.5% in those seen in general pulmonary clinic. CONCLUSIONS: ILD clinics, regardless of their association with a tertiary care center, can lead to improved monitoring of disease progression and co-morbidities in patients with IPF. Such dedicated care can also lead to more referrals to pulmonary rehab and palliative care. The key limitations to this study are the sample size and the retrospective design. In addition, we may not have captured patients with IPF who were not considered to be candidates for anti-fibrotic therapy. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: With minimal associated cost, dedicated ILD clinics, even those located in small healthcare systems, can improve care provided to patients with IPF.1) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: diagnosis and treatment.

This work presents a decision model that can minimize the cost of making a decision for predicting protein functions using the hierarchical homologies. Particularly, the model has three characteristics: (i) it is a hybrid evolutionary model with multiple fitness functions that uses genetic programming to predict protein functions on a distantly related protein family, (ii) it incorporates modified robust point matching to accurately compare all feature points using the moment invariant and thin-plate spline theorems, and (iii) the hierarchical homologies holding up a novel protein sequence in the form of a causal tree can effectively demonstrate the relationship between proteins.

This study compares the use of a new, noncommercial, long-chain cyanoacrylate (n-octyl) TA and Ifabond for mesh fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS In two implant models in the rabbit, expanded polytetrafluorethylene meshes were fixed to the parietal peritoneum using a TA or tacks (intraperitoneal model), or polypropylene meshes used to repair partial abdominal wall defects were fixed with a TA or sutures (extraperitoneal model). Animals were euthanized 14 or 90 d postsurgery and implant specimens were processed for microscopy (labeling of macrophages and apoptotic cells), peritoneal fluid and biomechanical strength testing. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) were determinated in peritoneal fluid. RESULTS Mesothelial cell deposition on the intraperitoneal implants fixed using the new TA and Ifabond was adequate and similar IL-6 and TNF- levels were detected in these implants. Intraperitoneal meshes fixed with tacks showed IL-6 overexpression. Three months after surgery, macrophage and apoptotic cell rates were higher for the intraperitoneal implants fixed with Ifabond versus the new TA or tacks. In the extraperitoneal model, reduced macrophage and cell damage responses were observed in the meshes fixed with sutures versus both TA. Tensile strengths were greater for the tacks versus TA in the intraperitoneal implants and similar for the sutures and TA in the extraperitoneal implants (90 d). CONCLUSIONS Both TA showed a good cell response in both models. Their use in an intraperitoneal location resulted in reduced tensile strength compared with the tacks.

Trainings were conducted from April to July 2018 and April to June 2019. In 2018, training needs were explored using a structured tool. Responses were coded using manifest content analysis and key issues identified. In 2019, respondents quantified the identified key issues using a Likert scale. Proportions of those who strongly agreed, agreed, neither agreed nor disagreed, disagreed or strongly disagreed were calculated and results presented in tables and charts. RESULTS: in 2018 and 2019, there were 183 and 191 respondents respectively. About 96% of respondents in 2018 supported training in biosafety and biosecurity citing individual, community and global benefits. Barriers highlighted included governance, financial, human resource, information and infrastructure challenges. In 2019, majority of respondents indicated inadequate guidelines dissemination, lack of financial resources, inadequate personnel, lack of equipped laboratories and lack of instructional materials among major barriers.

In vitro growth kinetics of these viruses were comparable to the virus containing the wild-type M41-S1. Furthermore, Neu5Ac binding by the recombinant viruses containing single N-glycosylation site knock-out mutations matched the Neu5Ac binding observed with the recombinant RBDs. Five N-glycosylation mutants lost the ability to bind Neu5Ac and gained binding to a different, yet unknown, sialylated glycan receptor on host cells.

The human Nod-like receptor (NLR) NLRP11 has been shown to regulate type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Here, we identified the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X as a novel binding partner of NLRP11, using co-immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS. DDX3X is known to enhance type I IFN responses and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We demonstrate that NLRP11 can abolish IKK?-mediated phosphorylation of DDX3X, resulting in lower type I IFN induction upon viral infection. These effects were dependent on the LRR domain of NLRP11 that we mapped as the interaction domain for DDX3X. In addition, NLRP11 also suppressed NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation in an LRR domain-dependent manner, suggesting that NLRP11 might sequester DDX3X and prevent it from promoting NLRP3-induced inflammasome activation. Taken together, our data revealed DDX3X as a central target of NLRP11, which can mediate the effects of NLRP11 on type I IFN induction as well as NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This expands our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying NLRP11 function in innate immunity and suggests that both NLRP11 and DDX3X might be promising targets for modulation of innate immune responses.","output":"DDX3X Links NLRP11 to the Regulation of Type I Interferon Responses and NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we study and explore two control strategies to decrease the spread of Zika virus in the human and mosquito populations The control strategies that we consider in this study are awareness and spraying campaigns We solve several optimal control problems relying on a mathematical epidemic model of Zika that considers both human and mosquito populations The first control strategy is broad and includes using information campaigns, encouraging people to use bednetting, wear long-sleeve shirts, or similar protection actions The second control is more specific and relies on spraying insecticides The control system relies on a Zika mathematical model with control functions To develop the optimal control problem, we use Pontryagins maximum principle, which is numerically solved as a boundary value problem For the mathematical model of the Zika epidemic, we use parameter values extracted from real data from an outbreak in Colombia We study the effect of the costs related to the controls and infected populations These costs are important in real life since they can change the outcomes and recommendations for health authorities dramatically Finally, we explore different options regarding which control measures are more cost-efficient for society","output":"Optimization of the Controls against the Spread of Zika Virus in Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Endometriosis is a painful disease affecting 10-15% of reproductive-age women.

However, data derived by case series and retrospective studies do not offer a coherent interpretation, since data from China suggest an increased risk of COVID-19, while data from the United States and Italy show a prevalence of COVID-19 in cancer patients comparable with the general population. Noteworthy, cancer and COVID-19 exploit distinct patterns of macrophage activation that promote disease progression in the most severe forms. In particular, the alternative activation of M2-polarized macrophages plays a crucial role in cancer progression. In contrast, the macrophage-activation syndrome appears as the source of M1-related cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 disease, thus indicating macrophages as a source of distinct inflammatory states in the two diseases, nonetheless as a common therapeutic target. New evidence indicates that NAMPT/NAD metabolism can direct both innate immune cell effector functions and the homeostatic robustness, in both cancer and infection. Moreover, a bidirectional relationship exists between the metabolism of NAD and the protective role that angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the COVID-19 receptor, can play against hyperinflammation.

Given that immune-inflammatory activity can be sex-biased in the setting of severe COVID-19 illness, we deliberately examined sex-specific autoimmune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of extreme clinical disease. MethodsWe used a bead-based array containing over 90 autoantigens previously linked to a range of classic autoimmune diseases to assess autoantibody (AAB) titers in 177 participants. All participants had confirmed evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on presence of positive anti-nucleocapsid IgG serology results (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois). We used multivariate analysis to determine whether sex-bias was associated with increased rates of AABs reactivity and symptom burden after SARS-CoV2 infection. Results82.4% of AABs reactivity was associated with being male compared to 17.6% with female.

Job characteristics were self-reported. Our results showed that post-lockdown, both the number of clients and journey duration significantly decreased. Taxi drivers opened their windows significantly more and reduced the use of air recirculation. UFP decreased significantly by 32% and BC by 31% post-lockdown, with a weaker positive correlation compared to pre-lockdown. The reduction of in-vehicle UFP was due mainly to the reduction of traffic flow and ventilation settings, though the latter probably varied according to traffic conditions. The variation of in-vehicle BC also tended to be related to the decrease in traffic flow post-lockdown. We emphasize the role of traffic emissions on in-vehicle air pollution and that preventive measures such ventilation settings would help to minimize the exposure of professional drivers and passengers to air pollutants.","output":"Changes in air quality in-taxis and in working conditions of taxi drivers pre- and post-lockdown, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Paris area."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundEarly in the pandemic, COVID-19 was found to infect adults at higher rates than children, leaving limited data on disease presentation in children. Further understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19 symptoms among children is needed. Our aim was to explore how symptoms vary between children testing positive for COVID-19 infection versus children testing negative. MethodsData analysis of symptom prevalence among pediatric patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) in the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS) with concern for COVID-19 who subsequently received COVID-19 testing. Inclusion criteria included patients 0-17 years-of-age, ED evaluation between March 15th, 2020 - May 11th, 2020, and those who were ordered for COVID-19 testing. Chart review was performed to document symptoms using ED provider notes. Comparisons were made using chi-squared t-tests and Students t-tests. ResultsFever (62.6%) and cough (47.9%) were the most prevalent symptoms among children with suspected COVID-19 infection. Compared to children with a negative COVID-19 test, children who tested positive had higher prevalence of myalgia (21.7% vs 6.0%) and loss of taste/smell (15.2% vs 0.9%). Over half of the children who tested positive for COVID-19 had public insurance (52.2%) and 58.7% of the positive tests occurred among children with Hispanic ethnicity. ConclusionsMyalgia and loss of taste/smell were found to be significantly more prevalent among COVID-19 positive children compared to children testing negative. Additionally, children with public insurance and those with Hispanic ethnicity were more likely to test positive, emphasizing the importance of social factors in the screening and decision-making process.","output":"Correlation of Suspected COVID-19 Symptoms with COVID-19 Positivity in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2-(2-fluoro-[1,1-biphenyl]-4-yl)-N-(1-phenylpropan-2-yl)propanamide was synthesized by a reaction between amphetamine and flurbiprofen in high yields.

The obtained results indicated that HNTO/AN at the 1 : 3 ratio exhibited a higher heat release, better thermal stability, low water content and a reasonable cost, compared to other co-crystals. This new co-crystal was fully characterized through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), confirming that this latter displayed similar characteristics to those of the co-crystal with a 1 : 1 ratio, which was recently developed.

It is revealed that these catalysts have greatly decreased the decomposition temperature of the HNTO/AN cocrystal. Moreover, because of the complete decomposition in the case of the (HNTO/AN)/GO-T-Co-T composite, the heat release has been increased as well. Isoconversional integral kinetic methods were exploited to determine the kinetic parameters of the different systems. According to the obtained results, these catalysts have a strong catalytic action on the decomposition of the co-crystal AN/HNTO for which the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor are considerably lowered.

Due to the excellent mechanical tribological properties, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and antibacterial properties of titanium, it is getting much attention as a biomaterial for implants. Furthermore, titanium promotes osseointegration without any additional adhesives by physically bonding with the living bone at the implant site. These properties are crucial for producing high-strength metallic alloys for biomedical applications. Titanium alloys are manufactured into the three types of , , and  + . The scientific and clinical understanding of titanium and its potential applications, especially in the biomedical field, are still in the early stages. This review aims to establish a credible platform for the current and future roles of titanium in biomedicine. We first explore the developmental history of titanium. Then, we review the recent advancement of the utility of titanium in diverse biomedical areas, its functional properties, mechanisms of biocompatibility, host tissue responses, and various relevant antimicrobial strategies. Future research will be directed toward advanced manufacturing technologies, such as powder-based additive manufacturing, electron beam melting and laser melting deposition, as well as analyzing the effects of alloying elements on the biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and mechanical properties of titanium. Moreover, the role of titania nanotubes in regenerative medicine and nanomedicine applications, such as localized drug delivery system, immunomodulatory agents, antibacterial agents, and hemocompatibility, is investigated, and the paper concludes with the future outlook of titanium alloys as biomaterials.

The objective of this study was to differentiate adenomatous polyps (APs) from hyperplastic polyps (HPs) with CCE. Methods In this single-center retrospective study, an analysis was conducted on the same CPs with both CCE and colonoscopy (CS) and histopathologically diagnosed as AP or HP. The color difference (E) between the polyp surface and the surrounding mucosa was calculated using the CIELAB color space method on white light (WL), flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (FICE), and blue mode (BM) CP images. We investigated the ability of the ratio of the color differences (E') to differentiate between APs and HPs. Results The size of all 51 polyps (34 APs, 17 HPs) was 7.54.6 mm with CCE and 7.34.2 mm with CS, and this difference was not significant (p=0.28). The FICEE' of APs was 3.31.8, which was significantly higher than the FICEE' of HPs (1.30.6; p<0.001). A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that FICEE' was useful for differentiating between APs and HPs, with an area under the curve of 0.928 (95% confidence interval, 0.843-1). The sensitivity was 91.2%, and the specificity was 88.2% with a cut-off value of 1.758. Conclusion Using FICE on CCE images of CPs and applying the CIELAB color space method, we were able to differentiate between APs and HPs with high accuracy.

Secondary attack rates among household contacts are estimated to be five to ten times higher than among non-household contacts, but it is unclear which individuals are more prone to transmit infection within their households. METHODS: Using address matching, a cohort was assembled of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 residing in private households in Ontario, Canada. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare characteristics of cases in households that experienced secondary transmission versus those that did not. Logistic regression models were fit to determine index case characteristics and neighbourhood characteristics associated with transmission. RESULTS: Between January and July, 2020, there were 26,714 cases of COVID-19 residing in 21,226 households. Longer testing delays (&#8805;5 days versus 0 days OR=3.02, 95% CI: 2.53 - 3.60) and male gender (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.38) were associated with greater odds of household secondary transmission, while being a healthcare worker (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.62) was associated with lower odds of transmission. Neighbourhoods with larger average family size and a higher proportion of households with multiple persons per room were also associated with greater odds of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for individuals to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as symptoms appear, and to isolate away from household contacts; this is particularly important in neighbourhoods with large family sizes and/or crowded households.","output":"Characteristics associated with household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Ontario, Canada: A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (Corona virus disease of 2019) is the clinical presentation of acute disease associated with infection by the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Centers across Europe and USA have recently been reporting a multi-system inflammatory syndrome affecting children (MIS-C) and young people ( 19 years), temporally associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, elevated serologic inflammatory markers and cytokine levels, in which major cardiovascular compromise is a key feature Children are presenting with multi-system involvement with significant inflammation and resemble Kawasaki Disease These patients manifested features of atypical Kawasaki disease together with cardiac inflammation overlapping with toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease shock syndrome This is most likely a post-infectious complication of infection with SARS-CoV-2 Our knowledge of this newly described entity is evolving by the day and this review summarizes the current available literature on case definition, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of this syndrome The pediatric and cardiology communities should be acutely aware of this new disease, probably related to SARS-CoV-2 infection An early diagnosis and management appear to lead to favorable outcome using classical therapies ? 2020, Pakistan Pediatric Journal All rights reserved","output":"Multi-system inflammatory syndrome associated with covid-19 in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Auditory feedback plays an essential role in the regulation of the fundamental frequency of voiced sounds. The fundamental frequency also responds to auditory stimulation other than the speaker's voice.

This involuntary response is difficult to identify and isolate by the conventional paradigm, which uses step-shaped pitch perturbation. We recently developed a versatile measurement method using a mixture of orthogonal sequences made from a set of extended time-stretched pulses (TSP). In this article, we extended our approach and designed a set of test signals using the mixture to modulate the fundamental frequency of artificial signals. For testing the response, the experimenter presents the modulated signal aurally while the subject is voicing sustained vowels. We developed a tool for conducting this test quickly and interactively. We make the tool available as an open-source and also provide executable GUI-based applications. Preliminary tests revealed that the proposed method consistently provides compensatory responses with about 100 ms latency, representing involuntary control.

We assessed habits of physical activity at baseline using a 12-month leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) questionnaire. Using Cox regression, we calculated hazard ratios adjusted for body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, history of type-2 diabetes, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alcohol consumption, history of coronary heart disease, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 24.9 years (interquartile range: 18.3-26.9), 208 men developed dementia and 128 developed AD. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for dementia comparing top vs. bottom tertiles of physical activity were 0.97 (95% confidence intervals: 0.69-1.38) for total physical activity volume, 0.96 (0.69-1.34) for conditioning LTPA volume, and 1.13 (0.80-1.61) for total LTPA volume.

The shelter-in-place measures led the rapid expansion of telemedicine to address the needs of the neurosurgical patient population. Our goal is to determine the extent of adoption of telemedicine across tumor, vascular, spine and function neurosurgery and utilization for new patient visits. Methods Single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who received neurosurgical care at a tertiary academic center from February to April 2020 was conducted. Patients evaluated from March to April 2019 were included for comparison. A total of 10,746 patients were included: 1247 patients underwent surgery, 8,742 were seen in clinic via an in-person outpatient visit and 757 were assessed via telemedicine during the study period. Results A 40-fold increase in the use of telemedicine was noted after the shelter-in-place measures were initiated with a significant increase in the mean number of patients evaluated via telemedicine per week across all divisions of neurosurgery (4.50.9 to 180.413.9, p<0.001). The majority of telemedicine appointments were established patient visits (61.2%), but the proportion of new patient visits also significantly increased to an average of 8.25.3 per week across all divisions. Conclusion Use of telemedicine drastically increased across all four divisions within neurosurgery with a significant increase in online-first encounters in order to meet the needs of our patients once the shelter-in-place measures were implemented.

But less-structured time may be related to executive function for other reasons - for example, because less-structured time provides opportunities to acquire conceptual knowledge relevant to using executive function on tasks. We thus tested the possibility that less-structured time is also related to younger children's externally cued executive function. In this remote online study, caregivers of 93 3- to 5-year-olds indicated the amount of time their child was typically spending in various activities while at home during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Activities were categorized as structured (primarily lessons with specific goals defined by adults or an app), less-structured (wide range of activities permitting choice and interaction with caregiver), passive (e.g., watching TV or videos), and primarily physical (e.g., bike riding). Children's externally cued executive function was assessed via the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS).

This partly may lead to failure to achieve the global goal of 90-90-90 targets in most developing countries including Ethiopia. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the virological failure and its predictors among children receiving antiretroviral therapy at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 253 study cohorts from January 2020-April 2021. Socio-demographic characteristics were collected using a structured questionnaire via a face-to-face interview, while detailed clinical data of the children were collected by reviewing the medical record. About 5 ml of blood were collected for the analysis of complete blood count and viral load quantification. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and variables at p-value < 0.05 in the multivariable analysis were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: In this study, the viral load suppression rate among antiretroviral therapy experienced children was 68.8%. Meanwhile, the overall virological failure among study participants was 19.4%. Children living without family (AOR = 3.63; 95%CI: 1.27C10.24), children with unemployed family (AOR = 4.95; 95%CI: 1.74C14.12), being wasted (AOR = 3.02; 95%CI: 1.19C7.67) being stunted (AOR = 2.38;95%CI:1.03C5.46), anemia (AOR = 5.50:95%CI;1.37C22.04) and being lymphopenic (AOR = 2.69:95%CI;1.04C7.75) were significantly associated with virological failure among children under treatment. CONCLUSION: Higher virological failure among children was noteworthy in the present study. Caretakers other than immediate family, unemployed family, wasted, stunted, anemia, and lymphopenia were significant independent predictors of virological failure. Hence, standard, and optimal management of children under treatment should be warranted.","output":"Virological failure and associated factors among children receiving anti-retroviral therapy, Northwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related pneumonia is leaded by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which infects host cells through receptors named Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Smoking is thought to be related to poor disease prognosis, as a large amount of evidence highlights the negative effects of smoking on lung health and its causal relationship with various respiratory diseases. Methods: We first evaluated the role of ACE2 expression level with tobacco effect. And correlation analyses were used to identify the related genes of ACE2 both in smoker trait and human normal multi-tissues. After intersections, hub genes were later used to further GSEA and co-regulated mechanisms were explored by GeneMANIA. We used UALCAN to perform survival curves of pan-cancers included 33 types of cancers. New clinical model of top co-occurrence cancer type was constructed and validated. Results: Effected by cigarette smoking, the expression level of ACE2 expressed statistically upwards in current smokers compared with never smokers, upwards in groups after acute smoke exposed compared with normal control. But no strong evidence detected in third-hand smoke, as poor amounts of samples, only 4. A little trend of expressing upwards became in groups after third-hand smoke compared with groups after clean air exposing. 4 genes included PIR, ADH7, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 were identified as ACE2 related genes in smoker trait and human normal multi-tissues. Then, we made the survival curves of pan-cancers in 4 genes. Brain lower grade glioma was the co-occurrence type as both ACE2, PIR and AKR1C3 had the significantly prognostic situation. Later, we made the new clinical prediction model as the C-index was 0.827 and the Area Under Curves (AUCs) of 1-year survival, 2-year survival and 3-year survival were 0.921(95%CI, 0.882-0.961), 0.911(95%CI, 0.860-0.962) and 0.878(95%CI, 0.818-0.939). In inner validation, the AUCs of 1-year survival, 2-year survival and 3-year survival were 0.777(95%CI, 0.640-0.914), 0.916(95%CI, 0.842-0.990) and 0.888(95%CI, 0.768-1.000). In outer validation one, the AUCs of 1-year survival, 2-year survival and 3-year survival were 0.764(95%CI, 0.672-0.856), 0.848(95%CI, 0.783-0.913) and 0.748(95%CI, 0.656-0.841). And in outer validation two the AUCs of 1-year survival, 2-year survival and 3-year survival were 0.740(95%CI, 0.654-0.826), 0.766(95%CI, 0.688-0.843) and 0.794(95%CI, 0.721-0.866). Conclusions: In our study, we compared the ACE2 expression level between smokers and non-smokers crowds and identified associated hub genes. Then we explored the further role of hub genes in tumor fields to identify the correlation and influence between the avoidable host factors such as smoking on COVID-19 contamination and tumor.

EPHS was also built into the national plan to promote the equalisation of public services across the country. A national standard was set for financial input to EPHS. As the services are co-funded by the central and local governments, a robust intergovernmental fiscal system is essential to guarantee that the hundreds of thousands of service providers have adequate financing to meet the service commitment. METHODS: We examined the flow of funds through Chinas complex intergovernmental fiscal system to see whether the promise of equal funding for EPHS was implemented, and how the costs were distributed across levels of government. Information was collated from funding documents issued by all levels of governments involved, for a sample that includes the central government, 12 provincial governments, eight prefectural governments and 11 county-level governments. For each level of government, we examined: (i) when and how much funding they disbursed or received from higher levels; (ii) when and how much matching funds were made; and (iii) the allocation rules adopted. RESULTS: Overall, we found the central government met its commitments for the program on time and in full, and good compliance from local governments in passing through funding from higher levels and as well as meeting their own financial responsibilities. However, we also found the following problems: (i) the involvement of so many levels of government resulted in delays in the disbursement of funds; (ii) the use of outdated population data in calculating required funding resulted in some under-allocation; and (iii) localities that needed funding the most were not well targeted by the distribution of funds. CONCLUSION: This study traces how the 2018 subsidy for EPHS was disbursed from the central government to service providers, focusing on the roles played by intermediate levels of subnational governmentsprovinces, prefectures and counties. In this way, it identifies gaps in the current intergovernmental financing of EPHS and points to areas for further improvement.

Our study evaluated the technique of combined computed tomography-guided hookwire and methylene blue localization. METHODS Seventy-five patients from November 2007 to August 2013 who underwent combined Hawkins hookwire and methylene blue localization of 76 total pulmonary nodules before video-assisted thoracic surgery-guided wedge resection were retrospectively reviewed. Multiple patient, nodule, and procedural characteristics were analyzed for correlation with successful wire localization and wire dislodgement. Successful wire localization was defined as absence of lesions requiring re-resection, wire dislodgement necessitating re-resection, or conversion to thoracotomy for localization. RESULTS Seventy-four patients were included in the study (75 pulmonary nodules - 1 patient had 2 lesions localized) and mean  SD patient age was 65.8  12.1 years and 50% were male. The mean  SD largest nodule diameter was 14.6  7.4 mm and 29.3% of these were subcentimeter pulmonary nodules. Increased age and history of malignancy were associated with malignant diagnoses (P = 0.037 and 0.009, respectively) Successful wire localization was present in 86.4% of patients. Lesions with lower mean distance to the pleura correlated with successful localization (P = 0.002). Wire dislodgement was present in 9.3% (7 patients) with 4 (5.3%) of these necessitating need for re-resection to establish pathologic diagnosis. Albeit wire dislodgement, 57.4% (4/7) still had successful thoracoscopic localization.

Bats appear to have some unique features in their innate immune system that inhibit viral replication causing limited clinical symptoms, and thus, contributing to the virus spill over to humans. Here, kidney epithelial cell lines derived from four bat species (Pteropus dasymallus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and Miniopterus fuliginosus) and two non-bat species (Homo sapiens and Mesocricetus auratus) were infected with EMCV and JEV. The replication of EMCV and JEV was lower in the bat cell lines derived from R. leschenaultii, R. ferrumequinum, and M. fuliginosus with a higher expression level of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) and interferon-beta (IFN-) than that in the non-bat cell lines and a bat cell line derived from P. dasymallus. The knockdown of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 in Rhinolophus bat cell line using antisense RNA oligonucleotide led to decrease IFN- expression and increased viral replication.

Interventions to alleviate the psychological impact of the pandemic are urgently needed. Whether mindfulness practice may protect against the harmful emotional effects of a pandemic crisis remains hitherto unknown. We investigated the influence of mindfulness training on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We hypothesized that mindfulness practitioners might manifest less pandemic-related distress, depression, anxiety, and stress than non-practitioners and that more frequent practice would be associated with an improvement in mental health during the pandemic. Therefore, we assessed pandemic-related distress and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the frequency of meditation practice at the peak of new infections (Feb 4-5; N = 673) and three weeks later (Feb 29-30; N = 521) in mindfulness practitioners via online questionnaires. Self-reported symptoms were also collected from non-practitioners at peak time only (N = 1550). We found lower scores of pandemic-related distress in mindfulness practitioners compared to non-practitioners. In general, older participants showed fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. In younger practitioners, pandemic-related distress decreased from peak to follow-up. Importantly, increased mindfulness training during the preceding two weeks was associated with lower scores of depression and anxiety at both assessments. Likewise, practice frequency predicted individual improvement in scores of depression, anxiety, and stress at follow-up.

The ability of a drug to access the anterior parts of the eye is negligible after systemic administration. Effective drug delivery to the eye is a major challenge due to the presence of protective mechanisms and physiological barriers that result in low ocular availability after topical application. The main purpose of this work was the improvement of the corneal and conjunctival permeation of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin, a wide spectrum antibiotic used for the most common eye infection, using a self-dissolving polymeric film. Films were prepared by the solvent casting technique, using polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft co-polymer (Soluplus), polyvynyl alcohol, and propylene glycol. Films were homogeneous in drug content and thickness, as demonstrated by adapting the Swiss Roll technique followed by microscopy observation. These films proved in vitro to control the release of the Ciprofloxacin. Ex vivo permeability studies using Franz diffusion cells and porcine cornea and sclera showed an effective permeability of the drug without inducing irritation of the tissues. Films swelled in contact with artificial tears forming an in situ gel over 20 min, which will improve drug contact and reduce the need of multiple dosing. The antibiotic activity was also tested in vitro in five types of bacterial cultures, assuring the pharmacological efficacy of the films.

The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique natural experiment because the source of unemployment is very likely to be exogenous to the individual. This study assessed the effect of job loss and job furlough on the mental health of individuals in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA AND METHODS: The data for the study came from the first and second waves of the national survey, the National Income Dynamics-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM), conducted during May-June and July-August 2020, respectively. The sample for NIDS-CRAM was drawn from an earlier national survey, conducted in 2017, which had collected data on mental health. Questions on depressive symptoms during the lockdown were asked in Wave 2 of NIDS-CRAM, using a 2-question version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 responses (0C6 on the discrete scale) were regrouped into four categories making the ordered logit regression model the most suited for assessing the impact of employment status on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The study revealed that adults who retained paid employment during the COVID-19 lockdown had significantly lower depression scores than adults who lost employment. The benefits of employment also accumulated over time, underscoring the effect of unemployment duration on mental health. The analysis revealed no mental health benefits to being furloughed (on unpaid leave), but paid leave had a strong and significant positive effect on the mental health of adults. CONCLUSIONS: The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented job losses, which impaired mental wellbeing significantly.

Severe cases are manifested by parenchymal lung involvement with a significant inflammatory response and the development of microvascular thrombosis. Several factors have been involved in developing this prothrombotic state, including the inflammatory reaction itself with the participation of proinflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction/endotheliitis, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and possibly the tissue factor (TF) overexpression. ARS-Cov-19 ACE-2 down-regulation has been associated with an increase in angiotensin 2 (AT2). The action of proinflammatory cytokines, the increase in AT2 and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies are known factors for TF activation and overexpression. It is very likely that the overexpression of TF in COVID-19 may be related to the pathogenesis of the disease, hence the importance of knowing the aspects related to this protein and the therapeutic strategies that can be derived. Different therapeutic strategies are being built to curb the expression of TF as a therapeutic target for various prothrombotic events; therefore, analyzing this treatment strategy for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is rational. Medications such as celecoxib, cyclosporine or colchicine can impact on COVID-19, in addition to its anti-inflammatory effect, through inhibition of TF.","output":"Role of Tissue Factor in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the Possible Ways to Inhibit It"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly spread over the world and kills infected patients. There is no proven medication for its treatment, so, all of the medications used for treatment are considered to be off-label. Off-label uses are not under regulation in the outbreak because there is no specific regulation for this condition. OBJECTIVES: In this short communication we aim at describing two ways of off-label use as clinical practice or investigational use. Further, we will describe the third way of off-label use, we named it pseudo-research and then we will state the most possible ethical challenges of off-label use for better perceptions and responsibility. RESULTS: The WHO considers off-label uses as country-specific. All international regulatory bodies consider off-label prescription as the physicians responsibility and legal by necessitating some requirements. There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice. CONCLUSION: There are different types of approaches, none of them is comprehensive and conclusive. Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational. Besides, compilation of a special guideline based on ethical principles especially non-maleficence and autonomy for investigational off-label uses in disasters is highly recommended.","output":"COVID-19 and off label use of drugs: an ethical viewpoint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The current educational disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has fuelled a plethora of investments and the use of educational technologies for Emergency Remote Learning (ERL). Despite the significance of online learning for ERL across most educational institutions, there are wide mixed perceptions about online learning during this pandemic. This study, therefore, aims at examining public perception about online learning for ERL during COVID-19. The study sample included 31,009 English language Tweets extracted and cleaned using Twitter API, Python libraries and NVivo, from 10 March 2020 to 25 July 2020, using keywords: COVID-19, Corona, e-learning, online learning, distance learning. Collected tweets were analysed using word frequencies of unigrams and bigrams, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and sentiment labeling, cluster, and trend analysis. The results identified more positive and negative sentiments within the dataset and identified topics. Further, the identified topics which are learning support, COVID-19, online learning, schools, distance learning, e-learning, students, and education were clustered among each other. The number of daily COVID-19 related cases had a weak linear relationship with the number of online learning tweets due to the low number of tweets during the vacation period from April to June 2020. The number of tweets increased during the early weeks of July 2020 as a result of the increasing number of mixed reactions to the reopening of schools. The study findings and recommendations underscore the need for educational systems, government agencies, and other stakeholders to practically implement online learning measures and strategies for ERL in the quest of reopening of schools.","output":"The pandemic semesters: Examining public opinion regarding online learning amidst COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections with viral pathogens are widespread and can cause a variety of different diseases. In-depth knowledge about viral triggers initiating an immune response is necessary to decipher viral pathogenesis. Inflammasomes, as part of the innate immune system, can be activated by viral pathogens. However, viral structural components responsible for inflammasome activation remain largely unknown. Here we analyzed glycoproteins derived from SARS-CoV-1/2, HCMV and HCV, required for viral entry and fusion, as potential triggers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in THP-1 macrophages. All tested glycoproteins were able to potently induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation, indicated by ASC-SPECK formation and secretion of cleaved IL-1. Lytic cell death via gasdermin D (GSDMD), pore formation, and pyroptosis are required for IL-1 release. As a hallmark of pyroptosis, we were able to detect cleavage of GSDMD and, correspondingly, cell death in THP-1 macrophages. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of NLRP3 and GSDMD in THP-1 macrophages confirmed and strongly support the evidence that viral glycoproteins can act as innate immunity triggers. With our study, we decipher key mechanisms of viral pathogenesis by showing that viral glycoproteins potently induce innate immune responses. These insights could be beneficial in vaccine development and provide new impulses for the investigation of vaccine-induced innate immunity.","output":"Viral Glycoproteins Induce NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Pyroptosis in Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Before the advent of an effective vaccine, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and lockdowns, have been the primary measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is high population-wide adherence, which requires information on current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. OBJECTIVE: Here we analyzed online news media coverage of COVID-19. We quantified the total volume of COVID-19 articles, their sentiment polarization, and leading subtopics to act as a reference to inform future communication strategies. METHODS: We collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available online at SciRide). Using topic detection, we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage the pandemic received in 2020. The sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 coverage to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25.3% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-language sources revealed that overall COVID-19 coverage was not exclusively negatively polarized, suggesting wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-language articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear, or crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of COVID-19 public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and to maximize the impact of governmental policy. The extent to which the quantity and quality of information from different communication channels (eg, social media, government pages, and news) influence public understanding of public health measures remains to be established. Here we conclude that a quarter of all reporting in 2020 covered COVID-19, which is indicative of information overload. In this capacity, our data and analysis form a quantitative basis for informing health communication strategies along traditional news media channels to minimize the risks of COVID-19 while vaccination is rolled out.","output":"Quantifying Online News Media Coverage of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Text Mining Study and Resource"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Mediastinal ectopic parathyroid adenoma is a frequent cause of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, traditionally treated by open surgery. Thoracoscopic access is associated with reduced morbidity in mediastinal surgery.

METHODS Two patients with recurrent secondary hyperparathyroidism and three with complicated primary hyperparathyroidism were operated on between July 2004 and August 2008 for ectopic mediastinal parathyroid glands. Fusion of single-photon emission computed tomography and computed tomography led to an exact identification of the culprit glands. Surgery was performed thoracoscopically with the da Vinci robotic system using a three-trocar approach. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully with the robotic system. No perioperative morbidity or mortality was noted. Median operating time was 58 (range 42-125) min. Intraoperative parathyroid hormone reduction indicated complete resection. Median hospital stay was 3 (range 2-4) days.

We evaluated rapid endovascular treatment in addition to standard care in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a small infarct core, a proximal intracranial arterial occlusion, and moderate-to-good collateral circulation. METHODS We randomly assigned participants to receive standard care (control group) or standard care plus endovascular treatment with the use of available thrombectomy devices (intervention group). Patients with a proximal intracranial occlusion in the anterior circulation were included up to 12 hours after symptom onset. Patients with a large infarct core or poor collateral circulation on computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography were excluded. Workflow times were measured against predetermined targets. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. A proportional odds model was used to calculate the common odds ratio as a measure of the likelihood that the intervention would lead to lower scores on the modified Rankin scale than would control care (shift analysis). RESULTS The trial was stopped early because of efficacy. At 22 centers worldwide, 316 participants were enrolled, of whom 238 received intravenous alteplase (120 in the intervention group and 118 in the control group). In the intervention group, the median time from study CT of the head to first reperfusion was 84 minutes. The rate of functional independence (90-day modified Rankin score of 0 to 2) was increased with the intervention (53.0%, vs. 29.3% in the control group; P<0.001). The primary outcome favored the intervention (common odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.8; P<0.001), and the intervention was associated with reduced mortality (10.4%, vs. 19.0% in the control group; P=0.04).

Medical professionals, notably junior doctors, are at increased risk of developing poor mental health and burnout. The GMC Barometer Study in 2020 showed that 32% of doctors found the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic detrimental to their wellbeing and mental health.The aim of this quality improvement project was to assess and improve hospital wellbeing support available to foundation doctors within Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (GHNHSFT) by learning and reflecting on the impact of COVID-19.MethodAfter identifying a lack of resources within GHNHSFT, wellbeing information boards were displayed in communal areas and distributed by email. These encompassed trust wide support, practical information including childcare and relaxation resources concentrating on mindfulness, exercise and culture. A survey of foundation doctors was completed to assess doctors focus and approach to wellbeing. Questions assessed influential factors in maintaining wellbeing, access to current hospital resources and future interventions.Result94% of respondents recognised that their focus on wellbeing increased during COVID-19. One third of foundation doctors found it challenging to maintain their wellbeing, with 40% reporting difficulty accessing hospital support and advice. The most important factors foundation doctors identified in maintaining wellbeing were exercise, cooking and baking, and social networks. Colleagues were a significant source of wellbeing support, followed by notice boards, email resources and social media.ConclusionCOVID-19 highlighted the importance and burden on wellbeing of foundation doctors, with a significant number struggling to access support. Future recommendations include the use of a buddy system, regular and accessible exercise classes and improved communication of wellbeing support and resources to staff members.Buddy systems have already shown success amongst teams however it is important these are accessible to all foundation doctors and universally offered within the trust. A weekly yoga class is being reintroduced to be available to all doctors.A particular focus has been the development of a health and wellbeing section to feature in the trusts weekly communications, with the aim to regularly signpost staff to ongoing wellbeing resources and support.Social networking and media were highlighted as important in both maintaining wellbeing and accessing resources. A future goal is to develop an official GHNHSFT Instagram or Twitter account focused on wellbeing.

It is now widely accepted that sepsis occurs in two concurrent phases, which consist of an initial immune activation phase followed by a chronic immunosuppressive phase, leading to immune cell death. Depending on the severity of the disease and the pathogen involved, the hosts immune system may not fully recover, leading to ongoing complications proceeding the initial infection. As such, sepsis remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality world-wide, with treatment options limited to general treatment in intensive care units (ICU). Lack of specific treatments available for sepsis is mostly due to our limited knowledge of the immuno-physiology associated with the disease. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms and cell types involved in eliciting infection-induced immune activation from both the innate and adaptive immune system during sepsis. In addition, the mechanisms leading to immune cell death following hyperactivation of immune cells will be explored. The evaluation and better understanding of the cellular and systemic responses leading to disease onset could eventuate into the development of much needed therapies to combat this unrelenting disease.","output":"Inflammation and Cell Death of the Innate and Adaptive Immune System during Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This retracts the article DOI: 10.1039/C8RA02090F.].","output":"Retraction: SNHG3 promotes proliferation and invasion by regulating the miR-101/ZEB1 axis in breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in newborns is difficult; however, this diagnosis is performed by cell culture or by detection of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis. Detection of C. trachomatis DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes using polymer chain reaction (PCR) may be a better tool for the diagnosis of infection by this pathogen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 premature newborns, all weighing less than 2500 g, were included in the study. A blood sample and nasopharyngeal lavages were obtained from each newborn. Leukocyte DNA was obtained by phenol-chloroform extraction technique. Detection of C. trachomatis was performed by amplifying the ompA gene using the PCR endpoint. Cell culture tests and the detection of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis by microimmunofluorescence assay were also performed. RESULTS: Twenty newborns were PCR-positive (45.5%), with this test being significantly associated with the presence of pneumonia (RR = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.01 to 5.17; P = .035). The cell culture of nasopharyngeal lavage was positive in only 7 samples and no significant association was observed with any clinical or laboratory data. The titer of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis associated with PCR-positive was 1:32 (RR = 2.74; 95% CI: 1.21 to 6.23; P = .008), however this titer was not associated with the presence of pneumonia.

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. METHODS We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates. RESULTS The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76). CONCLUSION Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Risk Factors for Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunctions in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been associated with several neurological disorders including headache, facial palsy, encephalitis, stroke, demyelinating disorders.

This article uses China UnionPay transaction data and takes Hubei, the worst-hit region by COVID-19 in China, as an example, to conduct empirical analysis using the generalized method of moments (GMM) of the impact of current urbanization patterns on the spread of the epidemic and economic recovery from the perspectives of time, industry, and regional differences. The study found that during the different stages of COVID-19, including discovery, outbreak, and subsidence, the overall impact of urbanization on the economy in Hubei Province was first positive, then became negative, and finally gradually increased. This process had significant industrial and urban heterogeneity, which was mainly manifested in losses in tourism and catering industries that were significantly greater than those in the audio-visual entertainment and digital office industries. Similarly, the recovery speed of large cities was lower than that of small and medium-sized cities. The main reason for these differences is that the one-sided problem of urbanization is more obvious in areas with higher urbanization rates. COVID-19 has drawn attention to the development of urbanization in the future, that is, the development path of one-sided economic resource agglomeration and scale expansion should be abandoned, with greater attention paid to the improvement of service functions and the development of amenities.

The World Health Organisation has emphasized that mental health care should be considered as one of the core sectors within the overall COVID-19 health response. By March 2020, recommendations for the organization of mental health services across Europe have been developed by several national and international mental health professional associations. METHODS: The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) surveyed a large European sample of psychiatrists, namely the \\"EPA Ambassadors\\", on their clinical experience of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment of psychiatric patients during the month of April 2020 in order to: a) identify and report the views and experiences of European psychiatrists; and b) represent and share these results with mental health policy makers at European level. Based on the recommendations issued by national psychiatric associations and on the results of our survey, we identified important organisational aspects of mental health care during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19. RESULTS: While most of the recommendations followed the same principles, significant differences between countries emerged in service delivery, mainly relating to referrals to outpatients and for inpatient admission, assessments and treatment for people with mental disorders. Compared to previous months, the mean number of patients treated by psychiatrists in outpatient settings halved in April 2020. In the same period, the number of mentally ill patients tested for, or developing, COVID-19 was low. In most of countries, traditional face-to-face visits were replaced by online remote consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings we recommend: 1) to implement professional guidelines into practice and harmonize psychiatric clinical practice across Europe; 2) to monitor the treatment outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing mental disorders; 3) to keep psychiatric services active by using all available options (for example telepsychiatry); 4) to increase communication and cooperation between different health care providers.","output":"Mental health services during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: Results from the EPA Ambassadors Survey and implications for clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

Patients with underlying diabetes mellitus (DM) are deemed at-risk for developing severe COVID-19 infection. In light of this, we aimed to evaluate the correlation between DM and chest CT severity scores (CTSS) in COVID-19 patients. Methods This was a hospital-based descriptive, analytical retrospective study conducted at our tertiary care hospital. A quantitative severity score was calculated among 220 patients with COVID-19 infection based on the degree of lung lobe involvement on CT chest scans. Based on CTSS, the patients were classified into groups of mild, moderate, and severe lung involvement. The association between DM and CTSS was evaluated using the chi-square test. Results The severity of lung involvement was higher among COVID-19 patients with a co-diagnosis of DM (29.3%) compared to those without DM (11.7%). This association of severe lung involvement with DM was statistically significant (p=0.002).

Acting as the building block of the HIV-1 capsid core, the HIV-1 capsid protein plays an important role in the viral life cycle and is an attractive target for antiviral development. A structure-based virtual screening workflow for hit identification was employed, which includes docking 1.6 million commercially-available drug-like compounds from the ZINC database to the capsid dimer, followed by applying two absolute binding free energy (ABFE) filters on the 500 top-ranked molecules from docking. The first employs the Binding Energy Distribution Analysis Method (BEDAM) in implicit solvent. The top-ranked compounds are then refined using the Double Decoupling method in explicit solvent. Both docking and BEDAM refinement were carried out on the IBM World Community Grid as part of the FightAIDS@Home project. Using this virtual screening workflow, we identified 24 molecules with calculated binding free energies between ? 6 and ? 12 kcal/mol. We performed thermal shift assays on these molecules to examine their potential effects on the stability of HIV-1 capsid hexamer and found that two compounds, ZINC520357473 and ZINC4119064 increased the melting point of the latter by 14.8 C and 33 C, respectively. These results support the conclusion that the two ZINC compounds are primary hits targeting the capsid dimer interface. Our simulations also suggest that the two hit molecules may bind at the capsid dimer interface by occupying a new sub-pocket that has not been exploited by existing CA inhibitors. The possible causes for why other top-scored compounds suggested by ABFE filters failed to show measurable activity are discussed.

A convenience sample of 50 airway course participants voluntarily underwent randomisation: 21 to the AIR-BOX group, 14 to the intubation box group, and 15 to the crash cart group. The volunteers were asked to intubate a manikin using the equipment from the storage unit of their randomisation. Outcome measures included time-to-readiness, time-to-intubation, first-pass success, and subjective operator experience. Results The mean time-to-readiness was 67.2 s with the AIR-BOX, 84.6 s with the intubation box, and 115 s with the crash cart.

Standard approaches for ePRO implementation are not established, warranting evaluation in community cancer practices. We present implementation findings of ePRO symptom monitoring across a large multisite community oncology practice network. METHODS: Patients initiating a new systemic therapy at one of the 210 practice sites at Texas Oncology were invited to use the Navigating Cancer ePRO platform, with stepped-wedge implementation from July to December 2020. Participating patients received a weekly prompt by text message or e-mail to self-report common symptoms and well-being. Severe self-reported symptoms triggered a real-time notification to nursing triage to address the symptom. Enrollment and compliance were systematically tracked weekly with evaluation of barriers and facilitators to adoption and sustainability. RESULTS: Four thousand three hundred seventy-five patients planning systemic treatment were enrolled and participated. Seventy-three percent (1,841 of 2,522) of enrolled patients completed at least one ePRO assessment. Among these individuals, 64% (16,299 of 25,061) of available weekly ePRO assessments were completed. Over a 10-week period, compliance declined from 72% to 52%. Barriers currently being addressed include lack of a second reminder text or e-mail prompt, inconsistent discussion of reported ePROs by clinicians at visits, and COVID-related changes in workflow. Facilitators included ease of use and patient and staff engagement on the importance of PROs for symptom management. CONCLUSION: ePROs can be effectively implemented in community oncology practice.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to conduct a narrative review and analyze the vulnerabilities of refugee children in Turkey from the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), more specifically SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing, with a specific focus on Syrian refugee children. Moreover, this article explores the actions taken to prevent and mitigate issues that arise from these vulnerabilities. METHOD: This narrative review article collected data from various primary and secondary sources on the Turkish refugee framework including national and international legislation, governmental and non-governmental data and reports, and scientific papers.

Methods CTSB-deficient (CTSB-/-) macrophages and the human lung epithelial cell line A549 cells treated with CA-074Me were infected with the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 strain of IAV (IAV-PR8). Viral entry and propagation were measured through quantitative real-time RT-PCR; production and localization of hemagglutinin (HA) protein in the infected host cells were analysed by Western blots, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy; production of progeny viruses were measured by a hemagglutination assay. Results CTSB-/- macrophages and CA-074Me-treated A549 cells had no defects in incorporating IAV-PR8 virions and permitting viral RNA synthesis.

Toll-like receptor 4 is implicated as a key upstream driver of a controlled inflammatory response, elicited by signals in male partner seminal fluid, to initiate expansion of the maternal Treg cell pool after mating. Here, we report that mice with null mutation in Tlr4 (Tlr4-/-) exhibit impaired reproductive outcomes after allogeneic mating, with reduced pregnancy rate, elevated mid-gestation fetal loss, and fetal growth restriction, compared to Tlr4+/+ wild-type controls. To investigate the effects of TLR4 deficiency on early events of maternal immune adaptation, TLR4-regulated cytokines and immune regulatory microRNAs were measured in the uterus at 8 h post-mating by qPCR, and Treg cells in uterus-draining lymph nodes were evaluated by flow cytometry on day 3.5 post-coitum. Ptgs2 encoding prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, cytokines Csf2, Il6, Lif, and Tnf, chemokines Ccl2, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl10, and microRNAs miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-223 were induced by mating in wild-type mice, but not, or to a lesser extent, in Tlr4-/- mice.

Evidence from controlled clinical trials is inconclusive.METHODSWe conducted a randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial at 27 hospitals in Spain. Patients had to be admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia within 7 days from symptom onset and not on mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices. Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with CP in addition to standard of care (SOC) or to the control arm receiving only SOC. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in categories 5 (noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen), 6 (invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), or 7 (death) at 14 days. Primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population.RESULTSBetween April 4, 2020, and February 5, 2021, 350 patients were randomly assigned to either CP (n = 179) or SOC (n = 171). At 14 days, proportion of patients in categories 5, 6, or 7 was 11.7% in the CP group versus 16.4% in the control group (P = 0.205).

We designed a novel approach to concentrate human and animal viruses from wastewater using porcine gastric mucin-conjugated magnetic beads (PGM-MBs). We systematically evaluated the performances of the PGM-MBs method (sensitivity, specificity, and robustness to environmental inhibitors) with six viral species including Tulane virus (a surrogate for human norovirus), rotavirus, adenovirus, porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus or TGEV), and two human coronaviruses (NL63 and SARS-CoV-2) in influent wastewater and raw sewage samples. We determined the multiplication factor (the ratio of genome concentration of the concentrated over that of the initial solution) for the PGM-MBs method, which ranged from 1.3 to 64.0 depending on the viral species. Because the recovery efficiency became significantly higher when calculated based on virus titers than genome concentration, the PGM-MBs method could be an appropriate tool for assessing the risk due to wastewater contaminated with infectious enteric viruses. PCR inhibitors were not concentrated by PGM-MBs, suggesting this tool will be successful for use with environmental samples. The PGM-MBs method is cost-effective (0.43 USD/sample) and fast turnaround (3 hours from virus concentration to genome quantification), and thus this method can be implemented for high throughput facilities. Based on good performance, intrinsic characteristics of targeting the infectious virus, robustness to wastewater, and adaptability to high throughput systems, we are confident that the PGM-MBs method can be applied for successful WBE and ultimately provides valuable public health information.","output":"A novel approach to concentrate human and animal viruses from wastewater using receptors-conjugated magnetic beads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses the problems of commercial banks related to the coping with abrupt changes in activities organization due to quarantine and moving to partially remote work.

Social distancing (SD) interventions applied so far have included school closures, remote working and quarantine. These measures have been shown to have large impacts on pandemic influenza transmission. However, there has been comparatively little examination of such measures for COVID-19. Methods: We examined the existing literature, and collated data, on implementation of NPIs to examine their effects on the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Data on NPIs were collected from official government websites as well as from media sources. Results: Measures such as travel restrictions have been implemented in multiple countries and appears to have slowed the geographic spread of COVID-19 and reduced initial case numbers. We find that, due to the relatively sparse information on the differences with and without interventions, it is difficult to quantitatively assess the efficacy of many interventions. Similarly, whilst the comparison to other pandemic diseases such as influenza can be helpful, there are key differences that could affect the efficacy of similar NPIs. Conclusions: The timely implementation of control measures is key to their success and must strike a balance between early enough application to reduce the peak of the epidemic and ensuring that they can be feasibly maintained for an appropriate duration. Such measures can have large societal impacts and they need to be appropriately justified to the population.

People infected with SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms; thus, they may contribute to silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool samples, monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in waste water (WW) has been proposed as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations. AIM: To test if the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in WW correlates with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. METHOD: We performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw WW samples collected from several major WW treatment plants in Greater Paris. The study period was 5 March to 23 April 2020, including the lockdown period in France (from 17 March). RESULTS: We showed that the increase of genome units in raw WW accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genome could be detected before the epidemic grew massively (around 8 March). Equally importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genome units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases, 29 days following the lockdown. CONCLUSION: This work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in WW could generate important additional information for improved monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at local or regional levels and emphasises the role of WW-based epidemiology.","output":"Evaluation of lockdown effect on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics through viral genome quantification in waste water, Greater Paris, France, 5 March to 23 April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is prevalent in most parts of the world.

Interleukin (IL)-6 acts as a mediator between pro- and anti-inflammatory reactivity by initiating trans- and classical-signaling, respectively. Hence, IL-6 is assumed to provide a target for a broad range of antiviral agents. Available immunosuppressive antivirals are directed to control an often exaggerated pro-inflammatory response that gives rise to complex clinical conditions such as lymphocytopenia. It is known that IL-6, via its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), initiates a pro-inflammatory response while an anti-inflammatory response is triggered by the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). Future antivirals should thus aim to target the mechanism that regulates switching between IL-6 trans- and classical-signaling. In this review, we propose that the tumour necrosis factor- converting enzyme ADAM-17 could be the master molecule involved in regulating IL-6 class switching and through this in controlling pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli. Therefore, ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery that would regulate host reactivity to infection and thereby limit or prevent fatal outcomes.","output":"Decoding the enigma of antiviral crisis: Does one target molecule regulate all?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In Australia, Chinese migrants are among the populations most affected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection but often experience late diagnosis or access to clinical care. This study aims to explore approaches to increase HBV testing in Australias Chinese community and inform evaluation planning, specifically to i) assess the feasibility and acceptability of HBV educational programs, and ii) compare HBV testing uptake in people receiving a tailored education resource focussing on liver cancer prevention compared with a standard HBV education package. METHODS: This is a pre-post mixed-methods pilot and feasibility study. People of Chinese ethnicity and unsure of their HBV infection or immunity status were recruited from ten community sites in Melbourne, Australia in 2019C2020. Participants were randomised to receive an education package (comprised of a leaflet and in-person one-on-one educational session) with a focus on either 1) standard HBV-related information, or 2) liver cancer prevention. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire prior to receiving the intervention and were followed up at 6 months time for a questionnaire and an opt-in semi-structured interview. Primary study outcomes included feasibility of study procedures, measured by recruitment, participation, and retention rates; acceptability of the education program assessed by acceptability scores; and HBV testing uptake rate in each arm. Secondary outcomes include HBV-related knowledge change, assessed by pre-post comparison; and factors affecting participants testing behaviour analysed using qualitative data. RESULTS: Fifty-four participants received an education package; baseline and follow-up data from 33 (61%) were available. The study procedures of recruitment and retention were feasible; the acceptability of the education program was moderate with improved HBV-related knowledge observed. Four participants self-reported being tested: one (1/15, 7%) in the standard HBV information group and three (3/18, 17%) in the liver cancer prevention information group. Factors identified as affecting testing included perceived relevance and seriousness of HBV, healthcare access and costs of testing, and perceptions of the role of primary care providers in HBV-related care. CONCLUSION: A tailored education program targeting ethnic Chinese in Australia was feasible with moderate acceptability.

Patients with severe disease that require hospitalization due to COVID-19 pneumonia remain at further risk of bacterial co-infections. There is limited evidence suggesting up to 3.5% bacterial co-infection upon admission and up to 13.5% of secondary infections after hospitalization for pneumonia yet antibacterial therapy usage remain as high, or even higher, than data seen for viral pneumonia, such as influenza. Unnecessary use of antimicrobial therapy may lead to further resistance and requires stewardship attention. METHODS: A single-center retrospective chart review was conducted in a community health system on all inpatient influenza admissions between October 1(st) 2019 to March 31(st) 2020 and all COVID-19 admissions during the same 6-month period one year later. Patients were excluded if age < 18, observation or emergency visit. The study aims to determine the percentage of patients that were prescribed antibacterial therapy during influenza season compared to during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included in the influenza group while 1411 patients were included in the COVID-19 group (Table 1). The percent of inpatients with positive bacterial respiratory cultures were 12% in both influenza and COVID-19 groups. Positive bacterial respiratory cultures collected within 48 hours of admission were 3.4% in the influenza group compared to 1.2% in the COVID -19 group. Seventy-three percent of patients in the influenza group received antibiotics during admission compared to 78% in the COVID -19 group. Azithromycin and/or ceftriaxone was most commonly prescribed (58% vs. 60%) (Figure 1). The median length of stay was 3 days in the influenza group compared to 5 days in the COVID-19 group. In hospital mortality was higher in the COVID-19 group (1.7% vs. 9%). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Despite the viral origin of influenza and COVID-19 and low incidence of bacterial infection, antibacterials were frequently prescribed in both indications but it appears to trend more so in the COVID-19 group.

In this study, GDF5 mutants with a decreased affinity for BMPR1A were generated. These mutants, GDF5 and BMP2 were tested for BMPR1A or BMPR1B dimerization with BMPR2 and for their chondrogenic, hypertrophic and osteogenic properties in chondrocytes, in the multipotent mesenchymal precursor cells C3H10T1/2, and the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2. Mutants with the lowest potency for BMPR1A/BMPR2 dimerization exhibited minimal chondrogenic and osteogenic activities indicating that BMPR1A is necessary for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation. BMP2, GDF5 and the R399E mutant stimulated expression of chondrogenic and hypertrophy markers in C3H10T1/2 cells and chondrocytes. However, R399E which dimerized BMPR1B and BMPR2 more potently than GDF5 or BMP2, displayed reduced hypertrophic activity. Therefore, we postulate that stronger BMPR1B signaling, compared to BMPR1A signaling, prevent chondrocyte hypertrophy and act as a cartilage stabilizer during joint morphogenesis.","output":"BMPR1A is necessary for chondrogenesis and osteogenesis while BMPR1B prevents hypertrophic differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: COVID-19-related patient care delays have resulted in an unprecedented patient care backlog in the field of orthopaedics. The objective of this study is to examine orthopaedic provider preferences regarding the patient care backlog and financial recovery initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An orthopaedic research consortium at a multi-hospital tertiary care academic medical system developed a three-part survey examining provider perspectives on strategies to expand orthopaedic patient care and financial recovery. Section 1 asked for preferences regarding extending clinic hours, section 2 assessed surgeon opinions on expanding surgical opportunities, and section 3 questioned preferred strategies for departmental financial recovery. The survey was sent to the institutions surgical and nonoperative orthopaedic providers. RESULTS: In all, 73 of 75 operative (n = 55) and nonoperative (n = 18) providers responded to the survey. A total of 92% of orthopaedic providers (n = 67) were willing to extend clinic hours. Most providers preferred extending clinic schedule until 6pm on weekdays. When asked about extending surgical block hours, 96% of the surgeons (n = 53) were willing to extend operating room (OR) block times. Most surgeons preferred block times to be extended until 7pm (63.6%, n = 35). A majority of surgeons (53%, n = 29) believe that over 50% of their surgical cases could be performed at an ambulatory surgery centre (ASC). Of the strategies to address departmental financial deficits, 85% of providers (n = 72) were willing to work extra hours without a pay cut. CONCLUSION: Most orthopaedic providers are willing to help with patient care backlogs and revenue recovery by working extended hours instead of having their pay reduced.

Many laboratories add a proxy virus to wastewater samples to determine losses associated with concentration and extraction of viral RNA. While measuring recovery of a proxy virus is an important process control, in this piece, we describe the caveats and limitations to the interpretation of this control, including that it typically does not account for losses during RNA extraction. We recommend reporting the directly measured concentration data alongside the measured recovery efficiency, rather than attempting to correct the concentration for recovery efficiency. Even though the ability to directly compare SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from different sampling locations determined using different methods is limited, concentration data (uncorrected for recovery) can be useful for public health response.","output":"Challenges in Measuring the Recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from Wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We presented a novel way to numerically characterize DNA sequences based on the graphical representation for the sequences comparison and analysis.

We estimated the contribution of \\"misclassified\\" cases and transmission from \\"missed\\" symptomatic infections to the English epidemic before 31st July 2020. Findings In our dataset of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in acute English Trusts with a recorded symptom onset date (n = 65,028), 7% were classified as hospital-acquired (with symptom onset 8 or more days after admission and before discharge). We estimated that only 30% (range across weeks and 200 simulations: 20-41%) of symptomatic hospital-acquired infections would be identified. Misclassified cases and onward transmission from missed infections could account for 15% (mean, 95% range over 200 simulations: 14.1%-15.8%) of cases currently classified as community-acquired COVID-19.

METHODS: PowerChek (Kogene Biotech, Korea), DiaPlexQ (SolGent, Korea), Anyplex (Seegene, Korea), AccuPower (Bioneer, Korea), LightMix (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Switzerland), and UltraFast kits (Nanobiosys, Korea) were evaluated. Limits of detection (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively. RESULTS: The LODs for upE ranged from 21.88 to 263.03 copies/reaction, and those for ORF1a ranged from 6.92 to 128.82 copies/reaction. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was found. All six kits correctly identified 8 of 8 (100%) positive clinical specimens. Based on results from the high inhibition panel, PowerChek and AccuPower were the least sensitive to the presence of PCR inhibition.

Methods and Results Patients undergoing coronary revascularization, aortic valve replacement, lower extremity peripheral vascular intervention, or carotid artery revascularization from up to 852 US hospitals in the Nationwide Readmissions Database were identified. Crude and risk-standardized red blood cell transfusion rates were determined for each procedure. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between respective procedural transfusion rates. Median odds ratios were estimated to reflect between-hospital variability in red blood cell transfusion rates following the same procedure for a given patient. There was wide variation in red blood cell transfusion rates across different procedures, from 2% following carotid endarterectomy to 29% following surgical aortic valve replacement. For surgical and endovascular modalities, transfusion rates at the same hospital were highly correlated for aortic valve replacement (r=0.67; P<0.001), moderately correlated for coronary revascularization (r=0.56; P<0.001) and peripheral vascular intervention (r=0.51; P<0.001), and weakly correlated for carotid artery revascularization (r=0.19, P<0.001).

Lastly, therapeutic drug monitoring also appeared challenging since a wide proportion of IPA patients had low plasma voriconazole concentrations, with a significant higher delay to reach voriconazole concentrations > 2mg/L in CAPA versus IAPA patients ( p = 0.045).ConclusionsICU patients presenting with ARDS during COVID-19 are very similar to those with severe influenza pneumonia in terms of prevalence of IPA and outcome, while CAPA is mainly favored by advanced age irrespective of the background. The dramatic consequences on the patients' prognosis emphasize the need for a better awareness in these particular populations. Larger prospective studies may help in designing the most well-adapted personalized management to prevent IPA, which represents a high burden of death in severe COVID-19 and Influenza pneumonia.","output":"Influenza- and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis: are the pictures different?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"National policy on global health (NPGH) arenas are multisectoral governing arrangements for cooperation between health, development, and foreign affairs sectors in government policy for global health governance. To explore the relationship between national and global processes for governing global health, this paper asks: in what forms of interaction between NPGH arenas and global health governance are learning and networking processes present? In a multiple case study of Norwegian and Swiss NPGH arenas, we collected data on intersectoral policy processes from semi-structured interviews with 33 informants in 2014-2015. Adapting Real-Datos framework, we analyzed each case separately, producing monographs for comparing NPGH arenas. Analyzing both NPGH arenas for relational structures linking external resources to internal policy arena processes, we found five zones of interactions - including institutions, transgovernmental clubs, and connective forms. These interactions circulate ideas and soften arenas boundaries. We argue that NPGH is characteristic of transnational governance of global health.

We found that the RGD-4C targeting domain enhances the cytotoxic activity of SAP against various tumor cell lines, in a manner dependent on v-integrin expression levels. In a subcutaneous syngeneic model of bladder cancer, RGD-SAP significantly reduced tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, systemic administration of RGD-SAP in combination with mitomycin C, a chemotherapeutic drug currently used to treat patients with bladder cancer, increased the survival of mice bearing orthotopic bladder cancer with no evidence of systemic toxicity. Overall, the results suggest that RGD-SAP represents an efficient drug that could be exploited, either alone or in combination with the state-of-the-art therapies, for the treatment of bladder cancer and, potentially, of other solid tumors.","output":"A Novel RGD-4C-Saporin Conjugate Inhibits Tumor Growth in Mouse Models of Bladder Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) activates the fibrinolytic protease plasmin, which is implicated in blood loss and transfusion. While antifibrinolytic drugs have improved blood loss and reduced transfusion, variable blood loss has been observed in similar PSF procedures treated with the same dose of antifibrinolytics. However, both the cause of this and the appropriate measures to determine antifibrinolytic efficacy during high-blood-loss spine surgery are unknown, making clinical trials to optimize antifibrinolytic dosing in PSF difficult. We hypothesized that patients undergoing PSF respond differently to antifibrinolytic dosing, resulting in variable blood loss, and that specific diagnostic markers of plasmin activity will accurately measure the efficacy of antifibrinolytics in PSF. METHODS: A prospective study of 17 patients undergoing elective PSF with the same dosing regimen of TXA was conducted. Surgery-induced plasmin activity was exhaustively analyzed in perioperative blood samples and correlated to measures of inflammation, bleeding, and transfusion. RESULTS: While markers of in vivo plasmin activation (PAP and D-dimer) suggested significant breakthrough plasmin activation and fibrinolysis (P < 0.01), in vitro plasmin assays, including TEG, did not detect plasmin activation. In vivo measures of breakthrough plasmin activation correlated with blood loss (R2 = 0.400, 0.264; P < 0.01), transfusions (R2 = 0.388; P < 0.01), and complement activation (R2 = 0.346, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite all patients receiving a high dose of TXA, its efficacy among patients was variable, indicated by notable intra-operative plasmin activity. Markers of in vivo plasmin activation best correlated with clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that the efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy to inhibit plasmin in PSF surgery should be determined by markers of in vivo plasmin activation in future studies.

A growing body of literature suggests that the way individual experiences isolation is a moderator of these negative health risks. How an individual perceives loneliness may be a product of ones social environment: namely, an individuals attachment style may indicate the extent to which he or she experiences feelings of loneliness. This is particularly relevant in the recent climate of social isolation due to COVID-19 restrictions and future pandemic response. The goal of this paper is to review and consolidate research in the domains of both loneliness and attachment and demonstrate how the two cyclically affect one another. We review the literature from a neurobiological point of view to explore the underlying bidirectional relationships between an individuals genetics, neuroendocrine system, and neuroanatomy, and an individuals attachment style with their primary caregiver. By examining animal models of loneliness and attachment we can see the behavioral and biological similarities between humans and animals, highlighting the importance of these types of studies.

Extended-host-range variants of MHV strain A59 were previously obtained from persistently infected cells (J. H. Schickli, B. D. Zelus, D. E. Wentworth, S. G. Sawicki, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 71:9499-9504, 1997). These variant viruses contain several mutations in the S protein that confer to the viruses the ability to enter cells in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner (C. A. de Haan, Z. Li, E. te Lintelo, B. J. Bosch, B. J. Haijema, and P. J. M. Rottier, J. Virol. 79:14451-14456, 2005). While the parental MHV-A59 is fully dependent on murine CEACAM1a for its entry, viruses carrying the variant mutations in the amino-terminal part of their S protein had become dependent on both CEACAM1a and heparan sulfate. Substitutions in a restricted, downstream part of the S protein encompassing heptad repeat region 1 (HR1) and putative fusion peptide (FP) did not alter the CEACAM1a dependence. However, when the mutations in both parts of the S protein were combined, the resulting viruses became independent of CEACAM1a and acquired the extended host range. In addition, these viruses showed a decreased binding to and inhibition by soluble CEACAM1a. The observations suggest that the amino-terminal region of the S protein, including the receptor-binding domain, and a region in the central part of the S protein containing HR1 and FP, i.e., regions far apart in the linear sequence, communicate and may even interact physically in the higher-order structure of the spike.","output":"Cooperative involvement of the S1 and S2 subunits of the murine coronavirus spike protein in receptor binding and extended host range."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perioperative goal-directed therapy is considered to improve patient outcomes after high-risk surgery.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of protocol compliance on postoperative outcomes following high-risk surgery, after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol. Through a before-after study design, patients undergoing elective high-risk surgery before (before-group) and after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol (after-group) were included. Perioperative goal-directed therapy in the after-group consisted of optimized stroke volume variation or stroke volume index and optimized cardiac index. Additionally, the association of protocol compliance with postoperative complications when using perioperative goal-directed therapy was assessed. High protocol compliance was defined as  85% of the procedure time spent within the individual targets. The difference in complications during the first 30 postoperative days before and after implementation of the protocol was assessed. In the before-group, 214 patients were included and 193 patients in the after-group. The number of complications was higher in the before-group compared to the after-group (n = 414 vs. 282; p = 0.031).

Estimating the transmissibility, which is usually characterized by the basic reproductive number R(0), the mean number of secondary infectious cases generated by a single primary infectious case introduced into a totally susceptible population, provides crucial information for the effort required to stop infection spreading. Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted indirectly through contaminated food and environment. An outbreak from March to June 2011 was reported to have occurred at an elementary school of 698 pupils in China and it was found that the outbreak was due to direct transmission between school children. Based on the symptom onset date and the social contact network of the children, in this study we estimate the serial interval (i.e. the gap in symptom onset between an infectee and its infector) and use different statistical methods to estimate R(0). Combining with the positivity of IgG antibodies tests, we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics model which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to estimate the overall R(0). Our analysis suggests a serial interval of mean = 23.9 days and standard deviation = 20.9 days. The different statistical methods suggest estimates for R(0) in the outbreak varying from 2.1 to 2.8, and the estimates from the transmission dynamics model are consistent with this range. Our estimates are in agreement with that from one study in England but are higher than that from one study in the United States. Our transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R(0) but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.","output":"Estimating human-to-human transmissibility of hepatitis A virus in an outbreak at an elementary school in China, 2011"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While Publicly Funded Health Insurance Schemes (PFHIS) can be an effective strategy to achieve Universal Health Coverage by offering financial protection, the extent to which they facilitate gender equity has been less explored. Women constitute one of the main vulnerable groups owing to a combination of health and economic vulnerabilities to access inpatient care services. Gender health equity requires that healthcare resources, such as PFHIS effectively reach women. This study investigates the gender differences in utilisation of Chief Ministers Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS) by looking at a large volume of claims data covering 2012 to 2014 in the southern Indian state, Tamil Nadu. Previous studies indicate that women in the state had a higher hospitalisation rate than men and are entitled equally to CMCHIS. By disaggregating the data on number of beneficiaries, claim status, average and total claim value, type of procedures based on gender on a random selection of 230265 cases, the paper points out that womens utilization of CMCHIS is significantly lesser than men. Women constitute only 36% of all beneficiaries and received only half of the total claim value disbursed through the scheme. This pro-male bias was found to be statistically significant and consistent across the scheme years, age group and type of procedures. The study concludes that the gender inequity in utilization of CMCHIS is conspicuous and needs immediate attention from policy makers and administrators.

METHODS: All interventions on the aorta that were carried out between January 2018 and December 2020 in Switzerland and entered in the Swissvasc registry were included in this overview. Interventions for the treatment of isolated pathologies of the iliac vessels as well as interventions on the ascending aorta and the proximal aortic arch were excluded. RESULTS: Open aortic surgery was performed in 28 hospitals and endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in 33. Just under half of these hospitals achieved the recommended minimum number of cases for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) of 30 open and endovascular interventions per year, which are currently discussed in the literature. In line with the literature 67% of the elective treatments for AAA were performed by EVAR. Corresponding to the current literature, 11% of the AAA were ruptured in the 3?year observation period. In contrast to the recommendations of the current guidelines almost 60% of the ruptured AAA were treated by open repair. There was a certain tendency for a spontaneous centralization in the treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies as 87% of the interventions were carried out in only 5 hospitals.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study enrolling all people living in retirement nursing homes (PLRNH), where at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected person was present. Medical and clinical data were collected. Variables were compared with Student's t-test or Pearson chi-square test as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate variables' influence on infection and symptoms development. Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate 30 days mortality predictors, considering death as the dependent variable. We enrolled 382 subjects. The mean age was 81.1510.97 years, and males were 140(36.7%). At the multivariate analysis, mental disorders, malignancies, and angiotensin II receptor blockers were predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection while having a neurological syndrome was associated with a lower risk. Only half of the people with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed symptoms.

However, teachers find it challenging to implement such programs due to overcrowded curricula. Integrating nutrition with core subjects such as mathematics could potentially address time constraints and improve the learning of both. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the impact of a cross-curricular nutrition and mathematics program on primary school students' portion size estimation skills. Secondary aims include impact on their nutrition knowledge, attitudes towards mathematics and evaluating the quality of the lessons. METHODS Twelve Year 3-4 classes from Catholic schools in New South Wales, Australia will be randomised to intervention (n = 6) or control (n = 6) groups. Teachers in the intervention group will receive a professional development workshop and resources to teach 4-5 lessons on portion size and measurements across 1-4 weeks.

Targeting vectors pseudotyped with distinct viral envelope proteins that influence cell tropism and transfection efficiency are useful tools not only for examining entry mechanisms or cell tropisms but also for vaccine vector development. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an excellent candidate for development as a pseudotype vector. A recombinant VSV lacking its own envelope (G) gene has been used to produce a pseudotype or recombinant VSV possessing the envelope proteins of heterologous viruses. These viruses possess a reporter gene instead of a VSV G gene in their genome, and therefore it is easy to evaluate their infectivity in the study of viral entry, including identification of viral receptors. Furthermore, advantage can be taken of a property of the pseudotype VSV, which is competence for single-round infection, in handling many different viruses that are either difficult to amplify in cultured cells or animals or that require specialized containment facilities. Here we describe procedures for producing pseudotype or recombinant VSVs and a few of the more prominent examples from envelope viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, baculovirus, and hemorrhagic fever viruses.","output":"Development and Applications of VSV Vectors Based on Cell Tropism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, three different molecules (cholesterol, phosphatidic acid, and polyethylene glycol) were used for the stabilization of liposomes during the nebulization process. The purpose of this article is to answer the question of whether the change in the composition of liposomes affected the parameters of generated aerosol and whether the nebulization process affected observed properties of liposomes. Firstly, liposomes with different composition were prepared and their properties were checked by dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering. The membrane properties were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy - especially generalized polarization (Laurdan) and anisotropy (Diphenylhexatriene). The same characteristic of liposomes was measured after the nebulization by vibrating mesh nebulizer. Cholesterol was capable of liposome stabilization because of increased membrane fluidity. The membrane properties of the outer and inner parts were not influenced by the nebulization process. Electrostatic stabilization was successful for the lowest concentration of phosphatidic acid, but after the nebulization process the hydration of the membrane outer part was changed. Higher amount of PEG needs to be added for successful steric stabilization. The nebulization process of the two lowest concentrations of PEG slightly influenced immobilized water and the rigidity of inner part of the membrane (especially around the phase transition temperature).","output":"Influence of liposomes composition on their stability during the nebulization process by vibrating mesh nebulizer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune bleeding disorder caused by circulating autoantibodies (inhibitor) directed against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII).

As machine learning methods become more common in health care settings, it is important to ensure that these methods do not contribute to racial disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial groups. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to assess a machine learning algorithm intentionally developed to minimize bias in in-hospital mortality predictions between white and nonwhite patient groups. METHODS: Bias was minimized through preprocessing of algorithm training data. We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a large academic health center between 2001 and 2012, drawing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. Patients were included if they had at least 10 hours of available measurements after ICU admission, had at least one of every measurement used for model prediction, and had recorded race/ethnicity data. Bias was assessed through the equal opportunity difference. Model performance in terms of bias and accuracy was compared with the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE). RESULTS: The machine learning algorithm was found to be more accurate than all comparators, with a higher sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic. The machine learning algorithm was found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.016, P=.20). APACHE was also found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.019, P=.11), while SAPS II and MEWS were found to have significant bias (equal opportunity difference 0.038, P=.006 and equal opportunity difference 0.074, P<.001, respectively).

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are among the most troublesome disorders for patients, as they can cause pain, affect oral functions and disturb dentists on the level of diagnosis and treatment. The most common symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorders are articulated sounds (such as clicking or TMJ crepitation), joint pain in comfort and function situations (jaw movements), pain or strain in masseter and jaw muscles and or restricted mandibular movements. One of the most modern biocompatible substances used to treat joint disorders, including the TMJ, is platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and injectable platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF) intra-articular injections in managing internal derangements of temporomandibular. METHODS: Twenty patients suffering from a unilateral click due to temporomandibular disorders were individually injected with 1 mL of (I-PRF) twice 1 week apart into the superior joint space of the TMJ with the internal disorder. Data were recorded and evaluated by the Helkimo index. This evaluation was conducted three times; 1 week after the first injection, 1 week after the second injection, and 6 months after the first injection. RESULTS: The clicking disappeared entirely in 14 out of 20 patients after 1 week of getting the first injection, and in all patients after 1 week of getting the second injection, and returned to two of them after a six-month since the first injection. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results showed the efficacy of the Injectable Platelet-Rich Fibrin (I-PRF) in managing articular clicking in patients with internal disorders of the temporomandibular joint.

Cardiac injury is not uncommon in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and therefore we aimed to investigate whether it stems from an abnormal coagulative state. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Traditional coagulation and whole blood rotational thromboelastometry tests were compared between patients with and without cardiac injury. Cardiac injury was defined by increased levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI). RESULTS: The study population consisted of 104 patients (67% males, median age 65 years), of whom 40 (38%) developed cardiac injury. No clinical differences in the traditional coagulation parameters were observed between patients with and without cardiac injury. Thromboelastometry analysis revealed abnormal maximum clot firmness (MCF) levels in FIBTEM assay in 80 (77%) patients. No significant differences in MCF values (p ?= ?0.450) and percentage of abnormal MCF (p ?= ?0.290) were detected between patients with and without cardiac injury. Cardiac injury - not hypercoagulability - was associated with mortality (p ?= ?0.016). CONCLUSIONS: No differences in traditional coagulation and rotational thromboelastometry parameters were found among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without cardiac injury.

Patients with acute respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation are treated with invasive (IMV) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). Although IMV reverses hypercapnia/hypoxia, it causes significant morbidity and mortality. There is strong evidence that patients treated with NIV have better outcomes, and NIV is recommended as first line therapy in these patients. Yet, several studies have demonstrated substantial variation in the use of NIV across hospitals, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality. Through a series of mixed-methods studies, we have found that successful implementation of NIV requires physicians, respiratory therapists (RTs), and nurses to communicate and collaborate effectively, suggesting that efforts to increase the use of NIV in COPD need to account for the complex and interdisciplinary nature of NIV delivery and the need for team coordination. Therefore, we propose to compare two educational strategies: online education (OLE) and interprofessional education (IPE) which targets complex team-based care in NIV delivery. METHODS AND DESIGN: Twenty hospitals with low baseline rates of NIV use will be randomized to either the OLE or IPE study arm. The primary outcome of the trial is change in the hospital rate of NIV use among patients with COPD requiring ventilatory support. In aim 1, we will compare the uptake change over time of NIV use among patients with COPD in hospitals enrolled in the two arms. In aim 2, we will explore mediators role (respiratory therapist autonomy and team functionality) on the relationship between the implementation strategies and implementation effectiveness. Finally, in aim 3, through interviews with providers, we will assess acceptability and feasibility of the educational training.

However, multiple clinics and hospitals have experienced a decrease in rates of acute myocardial infarction and corresponding cardiac catheterization lab activations, raising the question: Has the risk of myocardial infarction decreased during COVID? Sleep deprivation is known to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, and sleep has been importantly impacted during the pandemic, possibly due to the changes in work-home life leading to a lack of structure. We conducted a social media-based survey to assess potential mechanisms underlying the observed improvement in risk of myocardial infarction. We used validated questionnaires to assess sleep patterns, tobacco consumption and other important health outcomes to test the hypothesis that increases in sleep duration may be occurring which have a beneficial impact on health. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to shifts in day/night rhythm, with subjects waking up 105 minutes later during the pandemic (p <0.0001). Subjects also reported going to sleep 41 minutes later during the pandemic (p <0.0001). These shifts led to longer duration of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, subjects reported sleeping 6.8 hours per night, which rose to 7.5 hours during the pandemic, a 44 minute or 11% increase (p <0.0001).

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are thought to offer the most immediate and effective treatment for those severely afflicted by Covid-19. We devised an approach for rapid and efficient generation of human monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein-specific memory B cells were isolated from 12 subjects recovering from infection with that virus. Paired end single index sequencing was performed using up to 10,000 antigen-specific B cells per subject. Antigen-specific B cell clones were identified by unique diversity and joining gene V(D)J rearrangements and the CDR3 regions. VH and VL regions were cloned and the products expressed in 293T/17 cells to generate spike-specific human monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Forty-three human monoclonal antibodies were produced. Every monoclonal antibody so generated neutralized viruses pseudotyped with Spike protein of the Wuhan-1 strain. Eighteen monoclonal antibodies neutralized pseudotyped viruses with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50s) between 1 pg/mL and 1 ng/mL (6.7 x 10E-15 M to 6.7 x 10E-12 M), exceeding by 10-100-fold the potency of previously reported anti-SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Eight monoclonal antibodies neutralized viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins previously identified in clinical isolates, including receptor binding domain mutants and the C-terminal D614G mutant with IC50<6.7 x10E-12M.

In this present study, we investigate the effect of UV-C on earthworm, Perionyx excavatus and analyzed the DNA-damage response. Briefly, we expose the worms to different doses of UV-C and find that worms are highly sensitive to UV-C. As a primary response, earthworms produce coelomic fluid followed by autotomy. However, tissue inflammation followed by death is observed when we expose worm to increased doses of UV-C. In particular, UV-C promotes damages in skin layers and on the contrary, it mediates the chloragogen and epithelial outgrowth in intestinal tissues. Furthermore, UV-C promotes DNA damages followed by upregulation of H2AX on dose-dependent manner. Our finding confirms DNA damage caused by UV-C is directly proportional to the expression of H2AX.

Cannabis use tend to increase over generations, and acculturation seems to play a pivotal role. First generation migrants report equal or lower consumption of cannabis when compared with the majority population with a subsequent increase in following generations, with a clear association with acculturation factors.

This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in social settings. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction. The theoretical model can also be applied to look at aspects of the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require measures to be switched on and off and for this reason elimination is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for elimination, it would not on its own be an efficient mechanism to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up elimination, and be a better tool for the prevention of infection or reinfection. Because the analysis presented here is theoretical, and not data-driven, it is intended to be a stimulus for further data-collection, particularly on individual interactivity levels, and for more comprehensive modelling which takes account of the type of heterogeneity discussed here. While there are some clear lessons from the simple model presented here, policy makers should have these tested and validated by epidemiological specialists before acting on them.","output":"Human agency and infection rates: Implications for social distancing during epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last decades public discussion of opioids has changed radically. Opioid was once a word largely restricted to professional medical and pharmacological use for the treatment and management of pain. But propelled by the rapidly growing international wave of opioid use and overuse, it is now part of a much wider public discussion that covers more than pain medicine: dependency, addiction, over-prescription and oversupply, recreational drug use, and criminal drug trafficking. The word opioid is now controversial and value-laden. A key component of the developing views and values about opioids is carried by language, both written and spoken: on radio and television, in the social media, but also between healthcare professionals and patients, where communicating about pain in a context of emotionally and value-charged images of opioids can be challenging. This paper analyses aspects of the language of opioids. We document the shift from medical to addiction meanings and uses in the key term opioid, together with narcotic, drug, heroin, and to a lesser degree opiate and morphine. These changes follow four chronological phases in attitudes to pain and its treatment: traditional medical approaches to pain; pain being recognised as an under-treated 'fifth vital sign'; the pharmacological and medical promotion of opioid use for treating pain, especially chronic pain; and the current reaction where opioid has become a pejorative and emotive term, closely connected to words like epidemic and addiction.

Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by calculation of the binding free energy were also carried out for the most promising two ligand-pocket complexes from docking studies (alacepril and lisinopril) to clarify some information on their thermodynamic and dynamic properties and confirm the docking results as well.

Eventually, animal experiments and accurate clinical trials are needed to confirm the potential preventive and treatment effect of these compounds.","output":"Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation Revealed the Potential Inhibitory Activity of ACEIs Against SARS-CoV-2 Targeting the hACE2 Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine if playing music would affect novice surgical trainees' ability to perform a complex surgical task. BACKGROUND: The effect of music in the operating room (OR) is controversial. Some studies from the anesthesiology literature suggest that OR music is distracting and should be banned. Other nonblinded studies have indicated that music improves surgeons' efficiency with simple tasks. DESIGN/METHODS: A prospective, blinded, randomized trial of 19 novice surgical trainees was conducted using an in vitro model. Each trainee performed a baseline vascular anastomosis (VA) without music. Subsequently, they performed one VA with music (song validated to reduce anxiety) and one without, in random order and without prior knowledge of the study's purpose. The primary endpoint was a difference in differences from baseline with and without music with respect to time to completion, acceleration/deceleration (using a previously validated hand-tracking motion device), and video performance scoring (3 blinded experts using a validated scale). The participants completed a poststudy survey to gauge their opinions regarding music during tasks. RESULTS: Overall, 57 VAs by 19 trainees were evaluated. Average time to completion was 11.6 minutes. When compared to baseline, time to completion improved for both the music group (pa?=a?0.01) and no-music group (pa?=a?0.001). When comparing music to no music, there was no difference in time to completion (pa?=a?0.7), acceleration/deceleration (pa?=a?0.3), or video performance scorings (pa?=a?NS). Among participants, 89% responded that they enjoy listening to music while performing tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Using three outcome measures, relaxing music did not improve the performance of novice surgical trainees performing a complex surgical task, and the music did not make their performance worse. However, nearly all trainees reported enjoying listening to music while performing tasks.","output":"A Randomized Prospective Blinded Study Evaluating the Effect of Music on Novice Surgical Trainees' Ability to Perform a Simulated Surgical Task"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia is a major cause of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether PaO2/FiO2, oxygenation index (OI), SpO2/FiO2, and oxygen saturation index (OSI), commonly used to assess the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), can predict mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Methods. In this single-centered retrospective pilot study, we enrolled 68 critically ill mechanically ventilated adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. Physiological variables were recorded on the day of intubation (day 0) and postintubation days 3 and 7. The association between physiological parameters, PaO2/FiO2, OI, SpO2/FiO2, and OSI with mortality was assessed using multiple variable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the predictive models. Results. The ARDS severity indices were not statistically different on the day of intubation, suggesting similar baseline conditions in nonsurviving and surviving patients. However, these indices were significantly worse in the nonsurviving as compared to surviving patients on postintubation days 3 and 7. On intubation day 3, PaO2/FiO2 was 101.0 (61.4) in nonsurviving patients vs. 140.2 (109.6) in surviving patients, p = 0.004 , and on day 7 106.3 (94.2) vs. 178.0 (69.3), p &lt; 0.001. OI was 135.0 (129.7) in nonsurviving vs. 84.8 (86.1) in surviving patients (p = 0.003) on day 3 and 150.0 (118.4) vs. 61.5 (46.7) (p &lt; 0.001) on day 7. OSI was 12.0 (11.7) vs. 8.0 (10.0) (p = 0.006) on day 3 and 14.7 (13.2) vs. 6.5 (5.4) (p &lt; 0.001) on day 7. Similarly, SpO2/FiO2 was 130 (90) vs. 210 (90) (p = 0.003) on day 3 and 130 (90) vs. 230 (50) (p &lt; 0.001) on day 7, while OSI was 12.0 (11.7) vs. 8.0 (10.0) (p = 0.006) on day 3 and 14.7 (13.2) vs. 6.5 (5.4) (p &lt; 0.001) on day 7 in the nonsurviving and surviving patients, respectively. All measures were independently associated with hospital mortality, with significantly greater odds ratios observed on day 7. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was greatest on intubation day 7 (AUC = 0.775, 0.808, and 0.828 for PaO2/FiO2, OI, SpO2/FiO2, and OSI, respectively). Conclusions. Decline in oxygenation indices after intubation is predictive of mortality in COVID-19 patients. This time window is critical to the outcome of these patients and a possible target for future interventions. Future large-scale studies to confirm the prognostic value of the indices in COVID-19 patients are warranted.

Diphyllin and diphyllinosides are known as natural blockers of cellular vacuolar ATPases, and so can act as inhibitors of the pH-dependent fusion of viral envelopes with host cell endosomal membranes. Such pH-dependent fusion is a critical early step during the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. Accordingly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 profiles and cytotoxicities of diphyllin, diphyllinoside cleistanthin B, and two structurally related compounds, helioxanthin 8-1 and helioxanthin 5-4-2, are evaluated here using in vitro cell-based assay systems. Neither helioxanthin exhibits any obvious anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro. By contrast diphyllin and cleistanthin B do exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in Vero cells, with respective 50% effective concentrations (EC50) values of 1.92 and 6.51 M. Diphyllin displays anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect also in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CaCo-2) cells. Moreover, when diphyllin is added at various times post infection, a significant decrease in viral titer is observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, even at high viral multiplicities of infection. Importantly, neither diphyllin nor cleistanthin B are found cytotoxic to Vero cells in concentrations up to 100 M. However, the cytotoxic effect of diphyllin is more pronounced in Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that diphyllin and diphyllin analogues might be perfected as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in future preclinical studies, most especially if nanomedicine approaches may be invoked to optimize functional drug delivery to virus infected cells.","output":"Antiviral Activity of Vacuolar ATPase Blocker Diphyllin against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In RA, synovial fibroblasts become activated. These cells express fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and contribute to the pathogenesis by producing cytokines, chemokines and proteases. Selective depletion in inflamed joints could therefore constitute a viable treatment option. To this end, we developed and tested a new therapeutic strategy based on the selective destruction of FAP-positive cells by targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT) using the anti-FAP antibody 28H1 coupled to the photosensitizer IRDye700DX. METHODS After conjugation of IRDye700DX to 28H1, the immunoreactive binding and specificity of the conjugate were determined. Subsequently, tPDT efficiency was established in vitro using a 3T3 cell line stably transfected with FAP. The biodistribution of [111In]In-DTPA-28H1 with and without IRDye700DX was assessed in healthy C57BL/6N mice and in C57BL/6N mice with antigen-induced arthritis. The potential of FAP-tPDT to induce targeted damage was determined ex vivo by treating knee joints from C57BL/6N mice with antigen-induced arthritis 24 h after injection of the conjugate. Finally, the effect of FAP-tPDT on arthritis development was determined in mice with collagen-induced arthritis. RESULTS 28H1-700DX was able to efficiently induce FAP-specific cell death in vitro. Accumulation of the anti-FAP antibody in arthritic knee joints was not affected by conjugation with the photosensitizer. Arthritis development was moderately delayed in mice with collagen-induced arthritis after FAP-tPDT. CONCLUSION Here we demonstrate the feasibility of tPDT to selectively target and kill FAP-positive fibroblasts in vitro and modulate arthritis in vivo using a mouse model of RA. This approach may have therapeutic potential in (refractory) arthritis.","output":"Targeted photodynamic therapy selectively kills activated fibroblasts in experimental arthritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: As COVID-19 spreads across the world, there are concerns that people with asthma are at a higher risk of acquiring the disease, or of poorer outcomes. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the risk of infection, severe illness and death from COVID-19 in people with asthma. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including preprint repositories and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted (until 26 May 2020). Studies reporting COVID-19 in people with asthma were included. For binary outcomes, we performed Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analysis. We explored quantitative heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, meta regression and evaluating the I2 statistic. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies with an overall sample size of 587 280 were included. The prevalence of asthma among those infected with COVID-19 was 7.46% (95% CI = 6.25-8.67). Non-severe asthma was more common than severe asthma (9.61% vs. 4.13%). Pooled analysis showed a 14% risk ratio reduction in acquiring COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.80-0.94; p < 0.0001) and 13% reduction in hospitalization with COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.77-0.99, p = 0.03) for people with asthma compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the combined risk of requiring admission to ICU and/or receiving mechanical ventilation for people with asthma (RR = 0.87 95% CI = 0.94-1.37; p = 0.19) and risk of death from COVID-19 (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.68-1.10; p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The findings from this study suggest that the prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 patients is similar to the global prevalence of asthma.

However, very little is known about immune cell and cytokine alterations in specific organs of COVID-19 patients. Here, we evaluated immune cells and cytokines in postmortem tissues, i.e., lungs, intestine, liver, kidneys, and spleen of three patients with COVID-19. Imaging mass cytometry revealed monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell (DC) infiltration in the lung, intestine, kidney, and liver tissues. Moreover, in patients with COVID-19, natural killer T cells infiltrated the liver, lungs, and intestine, whereas B cells infiltrated the kidneys, lungs, and intestine. CD11b(+) macrophages and CD11c(+) DCs also infiltrated the lungs and intestine, a phenomenon that was accompanied by overproduction of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. However, CD11b(+) macrophages and CD11c(+) DCs in the lungs or intestine of COVID-19 patients did not express human leukocyte antigen DR isotype. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- expression was higher in the lungs, intestine, liver, and kidneys, but not in the spleen, of all COVID-19 patients (compared to levels in controls). Collectively, these findings suggested that IL-10 and TNF- as immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory agents, respectively,might be prognostic and could serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","output":"Imaging Mass Cytometric Analysis of Postmortem Tissues Reveals Dysregulated Immune Cell and Cytokine Responses in Multiple Organs of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe major objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of the technical and vocational training courses imparted to generate employment or enhance the productivity of participants.Design/methodology/approachThe study was conducted in the province of Sindh, Pakistan by adopting a quasi-experimental approach.

The primary study end point was the composite of death, cerebrovascular accident, and myocardial infarction at follow-up. A total of 304 consecutive patients with ULMCA stenosis treated with PCI or CABG and aged 80 years were selected and analyzed in a large multinational registry. Two hundred eighteen were treated with PCI and 86 with CABG. During the hospitalization, a trend toward a higher mortality rate was reported in PCI-treated patients (3.5% vs 7.3%, p = 0.32). At a median follow-up of 1,088 days, the incidence of the primary end point was similar in the 2 groups (32.6% vs 30.2%, p = 0.69). Incidence of target vessel revascularization at follow-up was higher in PCI-treated patients (10% vs 4.2%, p = 0.05).

In line with One Welfare principles, the health and welfare of animals, people and the kiln environment are interlinked. MATERIALS AND METHODS In December 2019, 119 WEs were assessed in seven brick kilns in three districts of Nepal, using the Equid Assessment Research and Scoping tool, developed by The Donkey Sanctuary. The objective was to measure welfare at the start of the brick kiln season. RESULTS Horses were the predominant species of WE. Hazardous housing and environments were seen in all kilns. Behaviour responses were mixed. Owner responses and animal examination indicated poor working conditions. Signs of harmful practice were evident in most animals. The majority were underweight, with poor general health, skin alterations and musculoskeletal issues.

Given the lack of validated treatments, there is an urgent need for the high-quality management of COVID-19. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are one tool that healthcare providers may use to enhance patient care. As such, it is necessary that they have access to high-quality evidence-based CPGs upon which they may base decisions regarding the management and use of therapeutic interventions (TI) for COVID-19. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess the quality of CPGs that make management or TI recommendations for COVID-19 using the AGREE II instrument. Methods: ? The proposed systematic review will identify CPGs for TI use and/or the management of COVID-19. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science will be searched from December 2019 up to December 2020. The primary outcome of this study is the assessed quality of the CPGs. The quality of eligible CPGs will be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. Descriptive statistics will be used to quantify the quality of the CPGs. The secondary outcomes of this study are the types of management and/or TI recommendations made. Inconsistent and duplicate TI and/or management recommendations made between CPGs will be compared across guidelines. Discussion: The results of this study will be of utmost importance to enhancing clinical decision-making among healthcare providers caring for patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the results of this study will be relevant to guideline developers in the creation of CPGs or improvement of existing ones, researchers who want to identify gaps in knowledge, and policy-makers looking to encourage and endorse the adoption of CPGs into clinical practice.

Results We found 35 published studies that compared changes in the pattern of childhood vaccinations before and during the pandemic. Thirteen were surveys; two mixed-methods surveys and interviews, three modelling studies and 17 retrospective cohort studies with historical controls. We also included ten reports by national or international agencies that had original data on vaccination uptake. Significant global disruptions to vaccine services were reported in Africa, Asia, America (including Latin America and the Caribbean) and Europe. We also found evidence of significant disruption to vaccine uptake for diphtheria tetanus pertussis, BCG, measles and polio. Countries, where vaccination rates were already suboptimal, had greater drops in uptake and there was evidence of smaller declines in younger children compared to older children. Children born to women who could not read and write were more likely to have an incompletely immunized child. Various initiatives were used to drive up vaccination rates post restrictions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from patients attending the Urology ED of the CHUP over 3 weeks, from 11 March to 1 April 2020, and from the same period in the previous year (from 11 March to 1 April 2019). RESULTS: During the pandemic, 46.4% fewer patients visited our urological ED (122 vs 263). There was no significant difference in the mean age or the number of old patients (aged &#8805;65 years) between the two periods. However, significantly fewer female patients sought emergency urological services during the COVID-19 pandemic period (32.7% vs 14.8%, P < 0.05). No significant differences were noted between different clinical severity groups under the MTS. In 2019, significantly less patients required hospitalisation. The most common reasons for admission, during both periods, were haematuria, renal colic and urinary tract infections. The authors recognise that the study has several limitations, namely, those inherent to its retrospective nature. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 significantly influenced people's urological care-seeking behaviour. Understanding the present situation is helpful for predicting future urological needs. Based on the results of this study, we have reason to speculate that people's requirements for urological services might grow explosively in the post-COVID-19 period.

The samples were tested by Real-time PCR, for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Yates-corrected chi squared, or Fisher's exact test were used to compare both animal-health status and positivity/negativity to pathogens, and the relationship between presence/absence of clinical signs and Real-time PCR-positivity. H. somni and BCoV were the most frequently identified pathogens. In BRD-diagnosed cattle, BAdV was detected in 13.8% (19/138), BRSV in 14.5% (20/138) and BPiV in 4.3% (6/138). Healthy cattle were mostly positive for H. somni (89.2%, 83/93). A statistically significant association was observed between clinical signs and positivity to M. haemolytica (p value = 0.016).

Efficacious vaccines should, at some point, be offered to placebo participants, which will occur before long-term efficacy and safety are known. METHODS: Following vaccination of the placebo group, we show that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be derived by assuming the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the placebo crossovers. This reconstruction allows estimation of both vaccine durability and potential vaccine-associated enhanced disease. RESULTS: Post-crossover estimates of vaccine efficacy can provide insights about durability, identify waning efficacy, and identify late enhancement of disease, but are less reliable estimates than those obtained by a standard trial where the placebo cohort is maintained. As vaccine efficacy estimates for post-crossover periods depend on prior vaccine efficacy estimates, longer pre-crossover periods with higher case counts provide better estimates of late vaccine efficacy. Further, open-label crossover may lead to riskier behavior in the immediate crossover period for the unblinded vaccine arm, confounding vaccine efficacy estimates for all post-crossover periods. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate blinded crossover and continued follow-up of trial participants to best assess vaccine durability and potential delayed enhancement of disease. This approach allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain participants on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunological and clinical effectiveness over time.","output":"Assessing Durability of Vaccine Effect Following Blinded Crossover in COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intestinal microbiota is thought to be an important biological barrier against enteric pathogens. Its depletion, however, also has curative effects against some viral infections, suggesting that different components of the intestinal microbiota can play both promoting and inhibitory roles depending on the type of viral infection.

CBPs in the gut microbiome are well studied, but their roles in the vagina microbiome and involvement in sexually transmitted infections, cervical cancer and preterm birth are largely unknown. We established a classification system for lectins and designed Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles for data mining of bacterial genomes, resulting in identification of >100,000 predicted bacterial lectins available at unilectin.eu/bacteria. Genome screening of 90 isolates from 21 vaginal bacterial species shows that those associated with infection and inflammation produce a larger CBPs repertoire, thus enabling them to potentially bind a wider array of glycans in the vagina. Both the number of predicted bacterial CBPs and their specificities correlated with pathogenicity.

Objective: The objective of the study to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City and to assess differences according to the treatment setting (ambulatory vs. hospital) and to the need of intensive care (IC). Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort, including consecutive patients with COVID-19 from February 26, 2020 to April 11, 2020. Results: We identified 309 patients (140 inpatients and 169 outpatients). The median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 33-54), 59.2% men, and 18.6% healthcare workers (12.3% from our center). The median body mass index (BMI) was 29.00 kg/m2 and 39.6% had obesity. Compared to outpatients, inpatients were older, had comorbidities, cough, and dyspnea more frequently. Twenty-nine (20.7%) inpatients required treatment in the IC unit (ICU). History of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and abdominal pain were more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. ICU patients had higher BMIs, higher respiratory rates, and lower room-air capillary oxygen saturations. ICU patients showed a more severe inflammatory response as assessed by white blood cell count, neutrophil and platelet count, C-reactive protein, ferritin, procalcitonin, and albumin levels. By the end of the study period, 65 inpatients had been discharged because of improvement, 70 continued hospitalized, and five had died. Conclusions: Patients with comorbidities, either middle-age obese or elderly complaining of fever, cough, or dyspnea, were more likely to be admitted.

Three specific research questions have been formulated. First, could the objectives defined in the 2030 Agenda be considered homogeneous, and could they uniquely measure the concept of sustainability? Second, are there significant correlations between the implementation of a CE in the EU and the SDGs? Finally, is the behaviour of the 28 countries that make up the EU homogeneous in terms of the results of the initiatives aimed at the implementation of a CE? From these questions, nine hypotheses are put forward concerning the possible relationships between a CE implementation and the fulfilment of SDGs in the EU. Using a correlation analysis, an exploratory factor analysis, and a cluster analysis, it has been demonstrated that (a) SDGs do not univocally measure the concept of sustainability; (b) there are significant relationships between CE and SDGs in the EU; (c) the behaviour of these European countries is not homogeneous.","output":"From the circular economy to the sustainable development goals in the European Union: an empirical comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we examined various forms of mathematical models that are relevant for the containment, risk analysis, and features of COVID\\\\19.

We report here on lessons learned from establishing a WBS program for SARS-CoV-2 integrated with a human surveillance program for COVID-19. We have established WBS at three campuses of a university, including student residential dormitories and a hospital that treats COVID-19 patients. Lessons learned from this WBS program address the variability of water quality, new detection technologies, the range of detectable viral loads in wastewater, and the predictive value of integrating environmental and human surveillance data. Data from our WBS program indicated that water quality was statistically different between sewer sampling sites, with more variability observed in wastewater coming from individual buildings compared to clusters of buildings. A new detection technology was developed based upon the use of a novel polymerase called V2G. Detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater varied from 102 to 106 genomic copies (gc) per liter of raw wastewater (L). Integration of environmental and human surveillance data indicate that WBS detection of 100 gc/L of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was associated with a positivity rate of 4% as detected by human surveillance in the wastewater catchment area, though confidence intervals were wide ( ~ 8.99 ? ln(100); 95% CI = 0.90C17.08; p < 0.05). Our data also suggest that early detection of COVID-19 surges based on correlations between viral load in wastewater and human disease incidence could benefit by increasing the wastewater sample collection frequency from weekly to daily.

Generally, V. parahaemolyticus recovered from the environment and/or seafood is thought to be non-pathogenic and the relationship between environmental isolates and acute diarrhoeal disease is poorly understood. In this study, we explored the virulence potential of environmental V. parahaemolyticus isolated from water, plankton and assorted seafood samples collected from the Indian coast. RESULTS: Twenty-two V. parahaemolyticus isolates from seafood harboured virulence associated genes encoding the thermostable-direct haemolysin (TDH), TDH-related haemolysin (TRH), and Type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) and 95.5% of the toxigenic isolates had pandemic strain attributes (toxRS/new(+)). Nine serovars, with pandemic strain traits were newly identified and an O4:K36 tdh(?)trh(+)V. parahaemolyticus bearing pandemic marker gene was recognised for the first time. Results obtained by reverse transcription PCR showed trh, T3SS1 and T3SS2 to be functional in the seafood isolates. Moreover, the environmental strains were cytotoxic and could invade Caco-2 cells upon infection as well as induce changes to the tight junction protein, ZO-1 and the actin cytoskeleton. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that environmental isolates of V. parahaemolyticus are potentially invasive and capable of eliciting pathogenic characteristics typical of clinical strains and present a potential health risk. We also demonstrate that virulence of this pathogen is highly complex and hence draws attention for the need to investigate more reliable virulence markers in order to distinguish the environmental and clinical isolates, which will be crucial for the pathogenomics and control of this pathogen.","output":"Genetic and virulence characterisation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated from Indian coast"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the first reports of the novel coronavirus in the US in early 2020, public health organizations have advocated preventative policies including stay-at-home orders that closed businesses, daycares, schools, playgrounds, and limited child learning activities. The impact of these policies on child neurodevelopment is unknown but may have significant long-term consequences. Methods: Leveraging a large and ongoing longitudinal study of child neurodevelopment, we examined general childhood cognitive scores (assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning) in 672 children between 0 and 3 years of age born between 2020 and 2021 (n-118) vs. the preceding decade from 2011 to 2019 (n=554). Brain neuroimaging (MRI) was also performed on each child. Using longitudinal mixed-effects models, we compared longitudinal trends of voxel-wise brain cognitive domain measures before and during the pandemic. Results: We find that children born during the pandemic (Since July 2020) have significantly reduced verbal, motor, and overall cognitive performance compared to children born pre-pandemic;and that skills have continued to decline as the pandemic has progressed. Moreover, we find that children from lower socioeconomic families have been most affected. These neurocognitive findings are supported by neuroimaging data, which also shows reduced brain white matter development in children born since July 2020 compared to their counterparts from 2011 to 2019.

METHODS: Using inductive thematic analysis techniques, this paper draws on semi-structured interviews from 23 expert stakeholders working across sectors of gendered violence prevention, sexual health, relationships and sexuality education, sport, and emotional and physical wellbeing. RESULTS: Findings note several key concerns, including (1) hesitation and lack of adequate information regarding relationships with women; (2) the potential negative influence of pornography; (3) the lack of opportunities to be engaged in sexual health promotion initiatives; and (4) limited opportunities to have meaningful conversations about dating, sex, and intimacy. CONCLUSIONS: Expert stakeholders note several important gaps in policy and practice that need to be addressed to better support cisgender heterosexual boys and young men, and to confront gendered violence and sexual violence.

A prospective cohort study with data collection at three phases (before, during and after Hajj) was conducted among Australian pilgrims between August and December 2015. Baseline datawere collected from421 pilgrims beforeHajj, with 391 providing follow-up data duringHajj and 300 after their home return. Most participants (78% [329/421]) received one or more recommended vaccines; travel agents' advice was the main factor affecting vaccination uptake. Most participants (69% [270/391]) practiced hand hygiene with soap and sanitizers frequently, followed by disposable handkerchief use (36% [139/391]) and washing hands with water only (28% [111/391]). During Hajj 74% (288/391) of participants reported one or more illness symptoms, 86% (248/288) of these symptoms were respiratory. Cough was less often reported among pilgrims who received vaccinations, cleaned their hands with soap or alcoholic hand rubs, while a runny nose was less common among those who frequently washed their hands with plain water but was more common among those who used facemasks. This study reveals that most Australian Hajj pilgrims complied with key preventative measures, and that tour group operators' advice played an important role in compliance.

METHODS: Data were collected on presentations of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes as well as on all paediatric presentations to the emergency department of a tertiary centre between 2015 and 2020. Data from the period of initial COVID restrictions in Australia (March to May 2020) were compared to the period March to May of the previous 5 years (pre-pandemic periods). RESULTS: The number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes was comparable in the pandemic period and pre-pandemic periods (11 in 2020 vs range 6-10 in 2015-2019). The frequency of severe diabetic ketoacidosis was significantly higher in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic periods (45% vs 5%; P <0.003), odds ratio 16.7 (95% CI 2.0, 194.7). The overall frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis was also significantly higher during the pandemic period (73% vs 26%; P <0.007), odds ratio 7.5 (95% CI 1.7, 33.5). None of the individuals tested positive for COVID-19. Presentations of people aged <18 years to the emergency department decreased by 27% in the pandemic period compared to the average of the pre-pandemic periods (4799 vs 6550; range 6268 to 7131). CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the frequency of severe diabetic ketoacidosis at presentation of type 1 diabetes was observed during the initial period of COVID-19 restrictions. We hypothesize that concern about presenting to hospital during a pandemic led to a delay in diagnosis.

Patients' characteristics, clinical outcomes, as well as selected characteristics regarding antibiotic use (indication, class used, rates and types of bacterial secondary and co-infection, and duration of treatment) were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen clinical studies reporting data from 2834 patients were included. Mean rate of antibiotic use was 74.0 % of cases. Half the studies reported occurrence of a bacterial co-infection or complication (10 studies). Amongst the latter, at least 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections. Pooled data of 4 studies show that half of patients receiving antibiotics were not severe nor critical. Detailed data on antibiotic use lack in most articles.

Women were also asked to complete a diary recording when doses of enoxaparin were injected, along with an estimation of the number of hours the AES were worn each day, if at all. Results were entered onto SPSS and analysed. RESULTS Sixty-seven women completed the questionnaire packs. Adherence to enoxaparin therapy was relatively high (82.4%). Women self-reported sub-optimal adherence levels to the AES, with 24% stating they never wore them once home. Reasons for this included being mobile, feeling hot and feeling as if they were cutting circulation off in the legs. Women reported a high level of acceptance of IPCD post caesarean section and would be happy for IPCD to be applied again in future deliveries, if required.

METHODS In the Carbon dioxide, Oxygen and Mean arterial pressure After Cardiac Arrest and REsuscitation (COMACARE) trial, we used a 23 factorial design to randomly assign patients after OHCA and resuscitation to low-normal or high-normal levels of arterial carbon dioxide tension, to normoxia or moderate hyperoxia, and to low-normal or high-normal MAP. In this paper we report the results of the low-normal (65-75 mmHg) vs. high-normal (80-100 mmHg) MAP comparison. The primary outcome was the serum concentration of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at 48 h after cardiac arrest. The feasibility outcome was the difference in MAP between the groups. Secondary outcomes included S100B protein and cardiac troponin (TnT) concentrations, electroencephalography (EEG) findings, cerebral oxygenation and neurological outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS We recruited 123 patients and included 120 in the final analysis. We found a clear separation in MAP between the groups (p < 0.001). The median (interquartile range) NSE concentration at 48 h was 20.6 g/L (15.2-34.9 g/L) in the low-normal MAP group and 22.0 g/L (13.6-30.9 g/L) in the high-normal MAP group, p = 0.522.

Recently, NSC has also been reported to exhibit antitumor activity and, according to computational studies, it is able to attack the protease enzyme of Coronavirus (COVID-19) and thus could be used as antiviral for COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, an increasing use of this drug could be envisaged in the coming years. NSC is readily metabolized with a half-life of 4.5 h giving rise to cotarnine, hydrocotarnine, and meconine, arising from the oxidative breaking of the CC bond between isoquinoline and phthalide moieties. Because of its potentially increasing use, high concentrations of NSC but also its metabolites will be delivered in the environment and potentially affect natural ecosystems. Thus, the aim of this work is to investigate the degradation of NSC in the presence of naturally occurring photocatalysts. As a matter of fact, the present contribution has demonstrated that NSC can be efficiently degraded in the presence of a derivative of the natural organic dye Riboflavin (RFTA) upon exposure to visible light. Indeed, a detailed study of the mechanism involved in the photodegradation revealed the similarities between the biomimetic and the photocatalyzed processes. In fact, the main photoproducts of NSC were identified as cotarnine and opianic acid based on a careful UPLC-MS2 analysis compared to the independently synthesized standards. The former is coincident with one of the main metabolites obtained in humans, whereas the latter is related to meconine, a second major metabolite of NSC. Photophysical experiments demonstrated that the observed oxidative cleavage is mediated mainly by singlet oxygen in a medium in which the lifetime of 1O2 is long enough, or by electron transfer to the triplet excited state of RFTA if the photodegradation occurs in aqueous media, where the 1O2 lifetime is very short.","output":"Biomimetic photooxidation of noscapine sensitized by a riboflavin derivative in water: The combined role of natural dyes and solar light in environmental remediation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of a supraglottic airway, also called laryngeal mask airway (LMA), is gaining in popularity for delivery of general anesthesia in certain situations and is shown to be safe.

We analyzed the level of evidence and risk of bias in each category and made suggestions accordingly. RESULTS: The virus was traced from its potential origin via possible ways of transmission to the last host. Symptomatic human-to-human transmission remains the driver of the epidemic, but asymptomatic transmission can potentially contribute in a substantial manner. Feces and fomites have both been found to contain viable virus; even though transmission through these routes has not been documented, their contribution cannot be ruled out.

The majority of emerging infections in humans are zoonotic. COVID-19 is an ideal example of a recently identified emerging zoonotic disease, causing a global pandemic. Anthropogenic factors such as modernisation of agriculture and livestock farming, wildlife hunting, the destruction of wild animal habitats, mixing wild and domestic animals, wildlife trading, changing food habits and urbanisation could drive the emergence of zoonotic diseases in humans. Since 2001, Bangladesh has been reporting many emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks such as nipah, highly pathogenic avian influenza, pandemic H1N1, and COVID-19. There are many other potential zoonotic pathogens such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Kyasanur forest disease virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever that may emerge in the future. However, we have a limited understanding of zoonotic diseases' overall risk in humans and associated factors that drive the emergence of zoonotic pathogens. This narrative review summarised the major emerging, re-emerging, neglected and other potential zoonotic diseases in Bangladesh and their associated risk factors. Nipah virus and Bacillus anthracis caused repeated outbreaks in humans. More than 300 human cases with Nipah virus infection were reported since the first outbreak in 2001. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) caused more than 550 outbreaks in poultry, and eight human cases were reported so far since 2007. People of Bangladesh are frequently exposed to zoonotic pathogens due to close interaction with domestic and peri-domestic animals. The rapidly changing intensified animal-human-ecosystem interfaces and risky practices increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. The narrative review's findings are useful to draw attention to the risk and emergence of zoonotic diseases to public health policymakers in Bangladesh and the application of one-health approach to address this public health threat.","output":"Major zoonotic diseases of public health importance in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Objectif Dcrire les caractristiques pidmiologiques et cliniques des patients COVID-19 admis au service de ranimation Mthodes Il sagissait dune tude prospective observationnelle de 4 mois (12 mars au 12 juillet) ralise au service de ranimation du Centre de Traitement COVID-19 de lh?pital national Donka Rsultats Durant la priode dtude, 6044 malades ont t tests positifs au SARS-CoV-2,140 parmi eux ont t admis en ranimation soit une prvalence de 2,3 % Lage moyen des patients tait de 59  14ans La majorit des patients (79 %) tait de sexe masculin Concernant les comorbidits, 77 % des patients avaient au moins une comorbidit mdicale dont lhypertension artrielle (55 %) et le diabte (38 %) Les signes cliniques les plus frquents taient la dyspne, (81 %), lasthnie physique (64 %) et la toux (60 %) La majorit de nos patients (91 %) a bnfici dune oxygnothrapie classique Le Syndrome de Dtresse Respiratoire Aigu?

A retrospective trend analysis was performed to assess demographic data of all laboratory-confirmed MERS and COVID-19 cases. Patients charts were reviewed for data on demographics, mortality, citizenship, sex ratio, and age groups with descriptive and comparative statistics; the data were analyzed using a non-parametric binomial test and chi-square test. Of all COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia,78%were male patients and 22% were female patients. This proportion of male COVID-19 patients was similar to that of male MERS patients, which also affected male patients more frequently than female patients. The number of COVID-19-positive Saudi cases was lower than that of non-Saudi cases, which were in contrast to that of MERS; COVID-19 appeared to be remarkably similar to MERS with respect to recovered cases.

Recognize at least 3 ways in which continuity of care is important in serious illness communication in end-of-life care for patients and families 2. Describe the role of the family liaison in supporting medical teams and patients families around end-of-life care communication Importance Due to visitor restrictions across hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, many families of critically ill patients could not be physically present with loved ones who were near the end of life (EOL). Clinicians also struggled with relying on telecommunication to deliver prognosis and offer support to grieving families. In an effort to optimize care teams, nonCpalliative care clinicians became family liaisons to provide phone or video updates to families of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Objective(s) To understand the role of family liaisons in end-of-life communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s) We conducted semistructured audio interviews with 23 clinicians (with additional interviews under way), 7 of whom were redeployed family liaisons, who worked with ICU patients at two U.S. academic hospitals that experienced surges in COVID-19 admissions. Transcripts were analyzed via thematic analysis. Results When patients families could not visit in person and were not able to grasp the seriousness of the patients rapidly deteriorating conditions, ICU clinicians experienced heightened distress and worried about providing care discordant with patients EOL wishes. Additionally, staff shortage and frequent team changes made it difficult for clinicians to provide timely and consistent updates via phone or video. Family liaisons, mostly recruited into the role due to the circumstances of COVID-19, reported that they served as a figure of continuity for families and medical teams and found meaning in their role by establishing trust and rapport with families, providing daily updates, and preparing families for goals-of-care conversations despite language or cultural differences. One ICU clinician reported that liaisons took the burden and worry away for teams and families. Conclusion(s) Continuity of care is essential in serious illness communication and may be provided by nonCpalliative care clinicians to help mitigate challenges during EOL care.

A PCH approach has the potential to enhance both quality of care and patient safety. Genome-wide sequencing can be used as a specific exemplar to showcase current opportunities and forecast future developments. RECENT FINDINGS: Information gained from genome-wide sequencing can increase awareness of common and rare medical complications. Care provided to children and their families may then shift from reactive to proactive. Pertinent categories of results from genetic testing include primary diagnostic findings, genetic modifiers of disease expression, and secondary findings. In addition, an individuals unifying genetic diagnosis, disease subtype, and pharmacogenomic profile can all inform drug selection and treatment outcome. Recent lessons learned from the integration of genome-wide sequencing into the clinic may be generalizable to other big data-driven interventions.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine students' users' attitudes and experiences and clinical facilitators' perspectives on student performances in the clinical setting post-virtual patient training. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative study design was used. SETTING: Nursing faculty at a local university in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: 24 nursing undergraduates and six clinical facilitators. METHODS: This study is a follow-up of an experimental study on the Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence (VCAAI). The study took place from the academic year 2017/2018 ended in November 2019. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted. All interviews and focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two overarching themes (students' virtual patient user experience and clinical facilitators' evaluations of students' clinical communication skills) comprising six themes were generated. Themes under students' user experience included: 1) attitudes toward virtual patient training, 2) virtual patient's role in student development, and 3) enhanced features and implementation suggestions. Themes under clinical facilitators' evaluations included: 1) insights on students' communication skills and 2) approaches to improve communication skills. An overlapping theme titled 'value of technology in teaching communication' comprised of mutual feedback from both students and clinical facilitators. Early implementation, continued accessibility, enhancing realism and technological improvements to the VCAAI were listed as key areas for program improvement, while increased situational sensitivity and language training are recommended to further enhance students' communication skills. CONCLUSION: The mixed attitudes toward virtual patient interactions and recognitions of the benefits of virtual patient simulations suggest the potential effectiveness of the use of virtual patients in teaching effective nursing communication skills.

However, expedited vaccine development has led to hesitancy amongst the general population. We evaluated the willingness of healthcare workers to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Methods From 12th to 21st December 2020, we recruited 1720 healthcare workers from six countries, including China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Bhutan. The self-administrated survey collected information on willingness to vaccinate, perception of COVID-19, vaccine concerns, COVID-19 risk profile, stigma, pro-socialness scale, and trust in health authorities. Results More than 95% of healthcare workers were willing to vaccinate. These participants were more likely to perceive the pandemic as severe, considered the vaccine safe, had less financial concerns, less stigmatization to the vaccine, increased pro-socialness mindset, and trust in health authorities. In multivariable analysis, high perceived risk index of the pandemic, lower physical harm index of vaccine, and high pro-socialness index were independent predictors. Conclusions Majority of healthcare workers in Asia are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination.

Specific mechanical features of tunneled cuffed catheters may improve hemodynamic performance and decrease thrombosis and infection rates. However, there currently is no proven advantage of one design over another. STUDY DESIGN Single-center randomized clinical trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS 302 hemodialysis patients who required a tunneled cuffed catheter as temporary or definite vascular access. INTERVENTION Palindrome Symmetric Tip Dialysis Catheter or HemoStar Long-Term Hemodialysis Catheter. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS The primary end point was primary assisted patency. Secondary end points were incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), thrombosis, and 2 indicators of rheologic function: mean effective blood flow rate and urokinase use. RESULTS Mean primary assisted patency was 135.9 days for Palindrome and 136.5 days for HemoStar (P=0.8). Definite CRBSI occurred in 0.24 and 0.10/1,000 catheter-days for Palindrome and HemoStar, respectively (P=0.3). Removal rates for thrombosis that could not be resolved with thrombolysis were 0.53 and 0.43/1,000 catheter-days for Palindrome and HemoStar, respectively (P=0.7). Urokinase use was lower for Palindrome than for HemoStar, as evidenced by a lower number of urokinase infusions/1,000 catheter-days (17 and 35; P<0.001) and higher number of catheters that never required thrombolysis (58% and 45%; P=0.03). Mean effective blood flow rate was higher for Palindrome than for HemoStar (333 and 304mL/min; P<0.001). LIMITATIONS Single-center nonblinded trial. CONCLUSIONS Primary assisted patency and incidence of infection and thrombosis were similar for both catheter types. The Palindrome catheter required less thrombolysis and achieved higher blood flow rates than the HemoStar catheter. These findings suggest that mechanical catheter design may improve catheter rheology, but does not affect risks for thrombosis and infection and hence catheter survival.","output":"Hemodialysis catheter design and catheter performance: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on the care of orthopedic patients.

This paper presents a weekly prediction of cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in India. A graded lockdown feature, which describes the status of lockdown, is derived and incorporated in the input dataset as one of the features. For prediction, this paper proposes a model which is a stacking of different deep neural networks which have recurrent connections. Vanishing gradients is a common issue with such networks with recurrent connections. Proper weight initialization of the network is one of the solutions to overcome the vanishing gradients problem. Hence, the weight distributions and convergence performance of some state-of-the-art weight initialization techniques have been analyzed in this paper. The proposed model is initialized with the technique which would aid to avoid the vanishing gradients problem and converge faster to a lower loss. This paper also provides a comparison of the proposed model for univariate and multivariate prediction with other prediction models such as statistical model - Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and deep learning architectures long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU).

This report describes two cases of vesicourachal diverticulum treated by resection using laparoendoscopic single-site surgery. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE In each case, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery was performed transperitoneally via one port at a subumbilical semicircular incision. Except for a flexible camera and SILS Port, traditional, non-flexible laparoscopic instruments were used. After the induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position (or lithotomy position). A 2.0-cm incision was made semicircumferentially following the natural subumbilical folds. After the umbilical ligament was cut under direct vision, a SILS Port was placed at the incision. The urachus was liberated distally down to the roof of the urinary bladder using 0 5-mm flexible camera. Vesicourachal diverticulum with a bladder cuff was completely excised under the supporting view of cystoscopy. Both patients' perioperative days were uneventful.

The anti-viral program extended to inhibit the replication of several other pathogenic viruses including Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and-2, Vaccinia virus, and Zika virus through a type I interferon (IFN)-independent mechanism. In addition, induction of NRF2 by 4-OI and DMF limited host inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV2 infection associated with airway COVID-19 pathology.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the kynurenine pathway by transforming l-tryptophan (Trp) into l-kynurenine (Kyn), a metabolite endowed with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. In dendritic cells, IL-6 induces IDO1 proteasomal degradation and shuts down IDO1-mediated immunosuppressive effects. In tumor cells, IL-6 upregulates IDO1 expression and favors tumor immune escape mechanisms. To investigate the role of IDO1 and its possible relationship with IL-6 in obesity, we induced the disease by feeding mice with a high fat diet (HFD). Mice on a standard diet were used as control. Experimental obesity was associated with high IDO1 expression and Kyn levels in the stromal vascular fraction of visceral white adipose tissue (SVF WAT). IDO1-deficient mice on HFD gained less weight and were less insulin resistant as compared to wild type counterparts. Administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist, to mice on HFD significantly reduced weight gain, controlled adipose tissue hypertrophy, increased insulin sensitivity, and induced a better glucose tolerance. TCZ also induced a dramatic inhibition of IDO1 expression and Kyn production in the SVF WAT. Thus our data indicated that the IL-6/IDO1 axis may play a pathogenetic role in a chronic, low-grade inflammation condition, and, perhaps most importantly, IL-6R blockade may be considered a valid option for obesity treatment.","output":"Pathogenetic Interplay Between IL-6 and Tryptophan Metabolism in an Experimental Model of Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Many articles have been published regarding chest-imaging in COVID-19, but fewer studies have been published in pediatric populations. COVID-19 symptoms in children are generally milder and radiological tests have fewer positive findings. Indications for chest imaging in pediatric COVID-19 patients remain unclear. This study aims to describe the chest radiographs performed in COVID-19 patients in a pediatric hospital, to review the current chest X-ray indications and to develop an specific age-adjusted protocol for chest-imaging in children with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective study in hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients in Navarre, Spain. Between March and December 2020, 44 children were included (mean age 3.8-year-old, 50 % males). Demographic information, cause of admission, symptoms, and clinical evolution were described. Chest imaging technique performed, indications and findings were analyzed. A literature review was performed searching for current COVID-19 pediatric chest-imaging indications. RESULTS: Chest X-rays were performed in 35 patients (80 % of admissions) and most common indications were fever and respiratory symptoms. 53 % of the chest X-rays were considered normal and the classical bilateral diffuse interstitial pattern, described in adults, was only present in 22 %. All patients with pathological chest X-rays were symptomatic and reported fever (100 %) and fever tended to be longer (fever duration: 4.25 vs. 2.46 days p:0.048) in patients with pathological radiographs. We present a specific protocol for chest-imaging in pediatric COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 clinical manifestations and radiological findings are milder and less specific in children. Imaging should not be used as a screening tool or a routine complementary test in pediatric COVID-19 patients, not even in hospitalized cases.","output":"Chest radiograph in hospitalized children with COVID-19.

We develop a working definition that may inform additional research and policy discussion and provide data on the demographic and labor market composition of these workers.In a three-step approach, we first apply the official industry guidelines issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to microdata from the 2017 and 2018 American Community Survey to identify essential workers regardless of actual operation status of their industry. We then use data on the feasibility of work from home in the worker's occupation group (Dingel and Neiman 2020) to identify those most likely to be frontline workers who worked in-person early in the COVID-19 crisis in March/April 2020.In a third step we exclude industries that were shutdown or running under limited demand at that time (Vavra, 2020). We find that the broader group of essential workers comprises a large share of the labor force and tends to mirror its demographic and labor market characteristics. In contrast, the narrower category of frontline workers is, on average, less educated, has lower wages, and has a higher representation of men, disadvantaged minorities, especially Hispanics, and immigrants.

Previous studies showed that SFTSV-infected patients exhibited elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1), indicating that SFTSV infection may activate inflammasomes. However, the detailed mechanism remains poorly understood. Herein, we found that SFTSV could stimulate the IL-1 secretion in the infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), human macrophages, and C57/BL6 mice. We demonstrate that the maturation and secretion of IL-1 during SFTSV infection is mediated by the nucleotide and oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein family, pyrin-containing domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. This process is dependent on protease caspase-1, a component of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. For the first time, our study discovered the role of NLRP3 in response to SFTSV infection.

Considering the importance of the existence of a suitable classifier, the present study aims to introduce an efficient approach based on the World Competitive Contests (WCC) algorithm as well as a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN). Unlike the previously introduced methods, which each has developed a universal model for all different kinds of data classes, our proposed approach generates a single specific model for each individual class of data. The experimental results show that the proposed method (ANNWCC), which can be applied to both the balanced and unbalanced datasets, yields more than 76% (without applying feature selection methods) and 90% (with applying feature selection methods) of the average five-fold cross-validation accuracy on the 13 clinical and biological datasets. The findings also indicate that under different conditions, our proposed method can produce better results in comparison to some state-of-art meta-heuristic algorithms and methods in terms of various statistical and classification measurements. To classify the clinical and biological data, a multi-layer ANN and the WCC algorithm were combined. It was shown that developing a specific model for each individual class of data may yield better results compared with creating a universal model for all of the existing data classes. Besides, some efficient algorithms proved to be essential to generate acceptable biological results, and the methods' performance was found to be enhanced by fuzzifying or normalizing the biological data.","output":"World competitive contest-based artificial neural network: A new class-specific method for classification of clinical and biological datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media is a virtual medium that eliminates the concepts of time and space, and its use is known to have increased during the pandemic.

This study aims to determine the internet addiction levels of young people, specific to the social media, with the restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic;and to propose solutions for the fight against the technology addiction which is accepted as an addiction type. The study employed a quantitative model. Two hundred fifty-eight young people in the 18-25 age range studying at different faculties of Sakarya University participated in the study. The Social Media Addiction Scale for Adolescents was administered to the participants. This scale is a measurement tool for determining university students' social media addiction levels, which has nine items, consists of a single factor, and is implemented in a five-point Likert form. For homogeneity testing, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov result was found at sig .00, and Cronbach's alpha value was found at .876 in the scale reliability analysis. The frequency, t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi-square tests were performed in the analysis of the data. This study is descriptive in terms of the function of the information. According to the findings, the average scale score was calculated as 2.0693, indicating that young people did not develop an addiction to social media. This result reveals two facts. First, youngsters are aware of both the positive aspects and the addictive nature of social media, and can control their usage behavior. Secondly, they no longer develop signs of addiction based on the variables sought for social media addiction.

This study describes the trajectory of psychosocial symptoms in the last 6 months of life among cancer decedents who were receiving home care. METHODS: Observational population-based cohort study of cancer decedents who were receiving home care services between 2007 and 2014. Decedents had to have at least one home care assessment in the last 6 months of life for inclusion. Outcomes were the presence of psychosocial symptoms (i.e., anxiety, loneliness, depression, social decline, caregiver distress, and cognitive decline) at each week before death. RESULTS: Our cohort included 27,295 unique cancer decedents (30,368 assessments), of which 58% died in hospital. Fifty-six percent were older than 74, and 47% were female. The prevalence of all symptoms increased approaching death, except loneliness. Social decline (48%-78%) was the most prevalent psychosocial symptom, though loneliness was reported in less than 10% of the cohort. Caregiver distress rose over time from 15%-27%. A third of the cohort reported issues with cognitive impairment. Multivariate regression showed that physical symptoms such as uncontrolled pain, impairment in independent activities of daily living, and a high level of health instability all significantly worsened the odds of having a psychosocial symptom in the last 3 months of life. CONCLUSION: In this large home care cancer cohort, trajectories of psychosocial symptoms worsened close to death. Physical symptoms, such as uncontrolled pain, were associated with having worse psychosocial symptoms at end of life.","output":"Trajectory of psychosocial symptoms among home care patients with cancer at end-of-life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considerable attention has been paid to inequalities in health. More recently, focus has also turned to inequalities in recovery; with research, for example, suggesting that lower grade of employment is strongly associated with slower recovery from both poor physical and poor mental health. However, this research has tended to operationalise recovery as return to baseline, and we know less about patterns and predictors when recovery is situated as a process. This paper seeks to address this gap. Drawing on data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, we operationalise recovery as both an outcome and as a process and compare patterns and predictors across the two models. Our analysis demonstrates that the determinants of recovery from poor health, measured by the SF-12, are robust, regardless of whether recovery is operationalised as an outcome or as a process. For example, being employed and having a higher degree were found to increase the odds of recovery both from poor physical and mental health functioning, when recovery was operationalised as an outcome. These variables were also important in distinguishing health functioning trajectories following a poor health episode. At one and the same time, our analysis does suggest that understandings of inequalities in recovery will depend in part on how we define it. When recovery is operationalised as a simple transition from poor health state to good, it loses sight of the fact that there may be inequalities (i) within a poor health state, (ii) in how individuals are able to step into the path of recovery, and (iii) in whether health states are maintained over time. We therefore need to remain alert to the additional nuance in understanding which comes from situating recovery as a process; as well as possible methodological artefacts in population research which come from how recovery is operationalised.","output":"Inequalities in recovery or methodological artefact?

There is growing evidence that the reasons for this difference are multi-factorial and need further exploration. AIM: The aim of this study was to understand better, perceptions of risk and responses to covid-19 of members of the Muslim community living in the North West of England, and to understand the facilitators and barriers to adherence to restrictions and guidance measures. METHOD: A total of 47 participants took part in 25 in-depth qualitative interviews and four focus groups (n=22) that explored perceptions of risk and responses to risk from covid-19. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Participants were aware of the mechanism of transmission of covid-19 and took steps to mitigate risk of transmission including, observing a range of hygiene practices and following social distancing guidance. Increased risk of covid-19 for BAME populations was explained largely in terms of exposure to the virus due to the types of employment people from BAME populations are employed in. Limitations both within the working environment and more generally in public spaces, was identified as problematic for effective social distancing. The closure of mosques sent out a strong message about the seriousness of the virus and religious teachings reinforced hygiene and social distancing guidelines. CONCLUSION: Across society there are people that adhere to restrictions and guidelines and those that do not. Improving local information provision and communication pathways during times of the pandemic, could aid understanding of risk and promote adherence to social distancing restrictions.

Although the negative impact of COVID-19 on patients with autoimmune diseases has also been recognized, available data in this regard are limited. In the current study of the European Autoimmunity Standardisation Initiative (EASI) we aimed to provide reliable data on the extent of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on test requests for different autoantibodies in European countries. METHODS: Data on test numbers and on the number of positive results were collected in 97 clinical laboratories from 15 European countries on a monthly basis for the year before (2019) and the year during (2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A reduction in the number of autoantibody tests was observed in all European countries in the year 2020 compared to 2019. The reduction affected all autoantibody tests with an overall decrease of 13%, ranging from 1.4% (Switzerland) to 25.5% (Greece). In all countries, the decrease was most pronounced during the first wave of the pandemic (MarchCMay 2020) with an overall decrease in those three months of 45.2%. The most affected autoantibodies were those commonly requested by general practitioners (anti-tTG IgA (?71%), RF IgM (?66%) and ACPA (?61%)). In the second wave of the pandemic (OctoberCDecember 2020) the decrease was less pronounced (6.8%). With respect to the rate of positive results, subtle differences were observed for distinct autoantibodies during the pandemic, but the total rate of positive results was similar in both years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a strong decrease in autoantibody requests during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 15 European countries. The second wave was characterized by a less pronounced impact, with some participating countries hardly affected, while some other countries experienced a second decline. The decrease was clearly associated with the level of lock-down and with the required adjustments in the health care systems in different countries, supporting the importance of an effective strategy for the coordination of autoimmune testing in challenging situations as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on autoimmune diagnostics in Europe: A lesson to be learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As COVID-19 vaccination programs are being rolled out globally, we studied the ethnic, deprivation, household size and comorbidity patterning of existing vaccination programs in populations at high-risk for COVID-19, to inform risk-stratified vaccination strategies and mitigate health inequalities. Methods: A population-level cohort study of UK adults aged 65 years or older, using a large primary care database. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess uptake of influenza, pneumococcal and shingles vaccination across ethnic groups, deprivation quintile, household size, and comorbidities, computing odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age, sex, demographics, body mass index and smoking. Offers and refusals of each vaccination type were analysed in those not receiving them. Findings: The cohort comprised 2,054,463 patients from 1,318 general practices. 1,452,014 (70.7%) patients received influenza vaccine, 1,391,228 (67.7%) received pneumococcal vaccine, and 690,783 (53.4%) received shingles vaccine. Compared to Whites, influenza vaccination uptake was lower in Pakistani (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.82;99% confidence interval: 0.74-0.90), Black Caribbean (OR 0.46;0.43-0.48), Black African (OR 0.63;0.58-0.68), Chinese (OR 0.70;0.64-0.76) and Other ethnic group (OR 0.65;0.63-0.69). The Black Caribbean group had higher vaccination refusal than the White group for influenza vaccination (OR 1.17;1.05-1.30). Vaccination uptake was lower among the more deprived and those living in household sizes above 3 or more persons, with some significant interactions between ethnicity and comorbidities. Uptake of all three vaccines was higher in those with asthma, COPD, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and learning disability, whilst lower in those with dementia. Interpretation: Whilst uptake and refusal of influenza, shingles and pneumococcal vaccination are patterned by ethnicity, deprivation, household size and comorbidities, vaccination offer is mostly patterned by comorbidities. This information can inform national policies to ensure equitable implementation of COVID-19 vaccination programs to avoid exacerbating health inequalities.Funding Statement: This project was funded by the Medical Research Council (Grant Ref: MR/V027778/1).Declaration of Interests: PST reports previous consultation with AstraZeneca and Duke-NUS outside the submitted work.

Studies have shown evidence of autonomic dysfunction in patients with ME/CFS, but results have been equivocal. Heart rate (HR) parameters can reflect changes in autonomic function in healthy individuals; however, this has not been thoroughly evaluated in ME/CFS. METHODS A systematic database search for case-control literature was performed. Meta-analysis was performed to determine differences in HR parameters between ME/CFS patients and controls. RESULTS Sixty-four articles were included in the systematic review. HR parameters assessed in ME/CFS patients and controls were grouped into ten categories: resting HR (RHR), maximal HR (HRmax), HR during submaximal exercise, HR response to head-up tilt testing (HRtilt), resting HR variability (HRVrest), HR variability during head-up tilt testing (HRVtilt), orthostatic HR response (HROR), HR during mental task(s) (HRmentaltask), daily average HR (HRdailyaverage), and HR recovery (HRR) Meta-analysis revealed RHR (MD  95% CI = 4.14  1.38, P < .001), HRtilt (SMD  95% CI = 0.92  0.24, P < .001), HROR (0.50  0.27, P < .001), and the ratio of low frequency power to high frequency power of HRVrest (0.39  0.22, P < .001) were higher in ME/CFS patients compared to controls, while HRmax (MD  95% CI = -13.81  4.15, P < .001), HR at anaerobic threshold (SMD  95% CI = -0.44  0.30, P = 0.005) and the high frequency portion of HRVrest (-0.34  0.22, P = .002) were lower in ME/CFS patients. CONCLUSIONS The differences in HR parameters identified by the meta-analysis indicate that ME/CFS patients have altered autonomic cardiac regulation when compared to healthy controls.

We explored the association of serum selenium levels in early pregnancy with the risk of GDM and preterm birth among Chinese women. We included 398 women with a singleton pregnancy, who were followed up prospectively from the first prenatal visit until delivery. Serum selenium levels were measured in the first trimester. After delivery, data concerning mothers and their children were sourced from medical records by researchers who were blind to the participants' selenium status. Of the 398 women, 71 (17.8%) had GDM, 21(5.3%) had preterm birth, and 266 (66.8%) had selenium deficiency (serum selenium < 70 g/L). Women in the upper three quartiles of serum selenium level did not have a significantly lower risk of GDM or preterm birth than those in the lowest quartile after adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.05). When serum selenium levels were classified as normal or deficient, the risk of GDM or preterm birth among women with normal serum selenium levels was still not lower than that of women with deficient serum selenium levels after adjustment for covariates (all p > 0.05).

Hypertension and diabetes will rise in Ghana as the population ages, urbanization increases, and people lead unhealthy lives. Our goal was to create a time series algorithm that effectively predicts future increases to help preventative medicine and health care intervention strategies by preparing health care practitioners to control health problems. METHODS: Data on hypertension and diabetes from January 2016 to December 2020 were obtained from three health facilities. To detect patterns and predict data from a particular time series, three forecasting algorithms (SARIMAX (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous components), ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average), and LSTM (long short-term memory networks)) were implemented. We assessed the model's ability to perform by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). RESULTS: The RMSE, MSE, MAE, and MAPE for ARIMA (5, 2, 4), SARIMAX (1, 1, 1)  (1, 1, 1, 7), and LSTM was 28, 769.02, 22, and 7%, 67, 4473, 56, and 14%, and 36, 1307, 27, and 8.6%, respectively.

While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they are able to model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by retrospectively modelling daily counts of deaths as two distinct phases in the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak: the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We consider various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures, in particular, the types and timings of preventative actions. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could be used to explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.","output":"Simple discrete-time self-exciting models can describe complex dynamic processes: a case study of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Statement of problem: The Covid pandemic has caught the universe unawares and has become the one single cause of human fatalities Due to lack of vaccines and the mutations that are happening, it has become imperative that prevention of the spread is the best cure As part of preventive measures hand washing has been the universally recommended protocol for which hand sanitizers are the ones being used Hand sanitizers do come with their drawbacks, like effect on human skin including absorption, economics and environmental issues Taking a clue from the way nature protects itself, studies have been done on bee hive The hive is exposed but protected from pathogens It has been found out that the chemical Propoli s is the basis of such a protective mechanism Further, studies have been done where in Propolis demonstrated anti-viral property It is a natural material which has been reported to have treasure of innumerable biological compounds which are proved to be effective antibiotic against bacteria, fungal and viral infection along with immunity booster effect Hence an attempt is being made to review the anti-viral property of Propolis with an intention that it may be considered as the natural anti-viral with less of adversities Materials and method: The in vivo and in vitro studies reported the treatment of viral infection with propolis were analysed Propolis OR propolis AND viral infection OR propolis AND treatment of viral infection, bee glue and propolis were the keywords used in search engines Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews PubMed/Medline and Scopus electronic databases were utilised Results: Propolis with high phenolic and flavonoids content has an effect in controlling viral infection The activity of these components comprises of inhibiting the chance of transmitting viral infections to different cells, preventing their propagation and also destroying the external envelope of the virus Conclusion: The literatures suggests that the propolis as medicament can be used in the treatment of viral infection It increases the host immunity Though there is a favourable result yet, the studies were animal studies, evidence are not sufficient to suggest, for use in covid-19 But it is also imperative to note that propolis can be a natural remedy for newer viral infection considering its broad-spectrum activity in human body and thus treating these infections Well-designed preclinical screening followed by randomized controlled trials are needed ? 2021, Advanced Scientific Research All rights reserved","output":"Environmentally safe, nontoxic and naturally occurring antiviral product propolisCa review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates how transport accessibility was associated with the accumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and its daily new cases, at the prefecture level, in Japan.

It has been responsible for small-to-large outbreaks in temperate areas including southern Europe and North America. Past outbreaks in 2006 on the islands of Maldives, as well as on other islands in the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia, demonstrated for the first time the capacity of CHIKV to disseminate through travel and transcontinental commerce, and revealed the major socio-economic impact of CHIKV epidemics. Recently, CHIKV has been circulating in highly touristic areas including the Maldives, where 1736 cases were notified by the Health Protection Agency during 2019. CASE SERIES: Among EuroTravNet/GeoSentinel patient records, eight CHIKV-confirmed cases imported the Maldives to France, Germany, Denmark, Italy and Spain were identified between February 2019 and February 2020; exceeding the total number of CHIKV infections travel-acquired in Maldives reported to this surveillance network during the previous 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention and control of CHIKV introduction into na?ve areas colonised by competent vectors is crucial. CHIKV outbreaks must be detected and reported in a timely manner. This must lead to adapted health information for international travellers and to prompt management of suspected imported cases. Conversely, travellers make for excellent sentinels and increased reports of imported cases might reflect a change in the level of endemicity or even herald an outbreak.

The knowledge of the contemporary evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed not only for a retrospective on how, when, and why COVID-19 has emerged and spread, but also for creating remedies through efforts of science, technology, medicine, and public policy. Global sequencing of thousands of genomes has revealed many common genetic variants, which are the key to unraveling the early evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 and tracking its global spread over time. However, our knowledge of fundamental events in the evolution and spread of this coronavirus remains grossly incomplete and highly uncertain. Here, we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history, phylogeny, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of tens of thousands of high-quality genomes. The reconstructed mutational progression is highly concordant with the timing of coronavirus sampling dates. It predicts the progenitor genome whose earliest offspring without any non-synonymous mutations were still spreading worldwide months after the report of COVID-19. Over time, mutations gave rise to seven major lineages that spread episodically, some of which arose in Europe and North America after the genesis of the ancestral lineages in China. Mutational barcoding establishes that North American coronaviruses harbor very different genome signatures than coronaviruses prevalent in Europe and Asia that have converged over time.

Smoking has also been suggested to contribute to the recurrence of aneurysms after endovascular coiling. To improve the understanding of the impact of smoking on long-term outcomes after coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms, the authors studied a consecutive contemporary series of patients treated at their institution. The aims of this study were to determine whether smoking is an independent risk factor for aneurysm recurrence and retreatment after endovascular coiling. METHODS All patients who had received an intrasaccular coil embolization of an intracranial aneurysm, who had undergone a follow-up imaging exam at least 6 months later, and whose smoking history had been recorded from January 2005 through December 2012 were included in this study. Patients were stratified according to smoking status into 3 groups: 1) never a smoker, 2) current smoker (smoked at the time of treatment), and 3) former smoker (quit smoking before treatment). The 2 primary outcomes studied were aneurysm recurrence and aneurysm retreatment after treatment for endovascular aneurysms. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests were used to test statistical significance of differences in the rates of aneurysm recurrence, retreatment, or of both among the 3 groups. A multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for smoking status and for several characteristics of the aneurysm was also performed. RESULTS In total, 384 patients with a combined total of 411 aneurysms were included in this study. The aneurysm recurrence rate was not significantly associated with smoking: both former smokers (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.61-1.65; p = 0.99) and current smokers (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31-1.09; p = 0.09) had odds of recurrence that were similar to those who were never smokers. Former smokers (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46-1.35; p = 0.38) had odds of retreatment similar to those of never smokers, and current smokers had a lower odds of undergoing retreatment (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.91; p = 0.03) than never smokers. Moreover, an analysis adjusting for aneurysm rupture, diameter, and initial occlusion showed that former smokers (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.33-1.28; p = 0.21) and current smokers (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.60-1.81; p = 0.88) had odds of aneurysm recurrence similar to those who were never smokers. Adjusting the analysis for aneurysm rupture, diameter, and occlusion showed that both former smokers (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.23-1.05; p = 0.07) and current smokers (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.46-1.46; p = 0.50) had odds of retreatment similar to those of patients who were never smokers. CONCLUSIONS The results show that smoking was not an independent risk factor for aneurysm recurrence and aneurysm retreatment among patients receiving endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms at the authors' institution.

However, a global increase in the prevalence of fatigue, brain fog, depression and other sickness behavior-like symptoms implicates a possible dysregulation in neuroimmune mechanisms even among those never infected by the virus. We compared fifty-seven Pre-Pandemic and fifteen Pandemic datasets from individuals originally enrolled as control subjects for various completed, or ongoing, research studies available in our records, with a confirmed negative test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We used a combination of multimodal molecular brain imaging (simultaneous positron emission tomography / magnetic resonance spectroscopy), behavioral measurements, imaging transcriptomics and serum testing to uncover links between pandemic-related stressors and neuroinflammation. Healthy individuals examined after the enforcement of 2020 lockdown/stay-at-home measures demonstrated elevated brain levels of two independent neuroinflammatory markers (the 18 kDa translocator protein, TSPO, and myoinositol) compared to pre-lockdown subjects. The serum levels of two inflammatory markers (interleukin-16 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) were also elevated, although these effects did not reach statistical significance after correcting for multiple comparisons. Subjects endorsing higher symptom burden showed higher TSPO signal in the hippocampus (mood alteration, mental fatigue), intraparietal sulcus and precuneus (physical fatigue), compared to those reporting little/no symptoms. Post-lockdown TSPO signal changes were spatially aligned with the constitutive expression of several genes involved in immune/neuroimmune functions.

A majority of the staff who perform POCT are not trained laboratory staff and may not be as knowledgeable about the processes involved in testing, such as patient preparation, sample collection, management of equipment and supplies, instrument calibration and maintenance, the performance of the test, quality control, interpretation of the results, and reporting/documentation of results in each patient's context. Therefore, staff performing POCT must have the proper training and experience to ensure test results are accurate and reliable. This short communication outlines the specific requirements for staff training based on international standards which need to be considered to ensure the quality of test results and describes competency criteria required for compliance with POCT.","output":"Training and Competency Strategies for Point-of-Care Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"KEY POINTS: The impact of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection on autonomic and cardiovascular function in otherwise healthy individuals is unknown. For the first time it is shown that young adults recovering from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 have elevated resting sympathetic activity, but similar heart rate and blood pressure, compared with control subjects. Survivors of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 also exhibit similar sympathetic nerve activity and haemodynamics, but decreased pain perception, during a cold pressor test compared with healthy controls. Further, these individuals display higher sympathetic nerve activity throughout an orthostatic challenge, as well as an exaggerated heart rate response to orthostasis. If similar autonomic dysregulation, like that found here in young individuals, is present in older adults following SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, there may be substantial adverse implications for cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) can elicit systemic adverse physiological effects. However, the impact of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 on autonomic and cardiovascular function in otherwise healthy individuals remains unclear. Young adults who tested positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 (COV+; n = 16, 8 F) visited the laboratory 35  16 days following diagnosis. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and heart rate (HR) were measured in participants at rest and during a 2 min cold pressor test (CPT) and 5 min each at 30 and 60 head\\\\up tilt (HUT). Data were compared with age\\\\matched healthy controls (CON; n = 14, 9 F). COV+ participants (18.2  6.6 bursts min(?1)) had higher resting MSNA burst frequency compared with CON (12.7  3.4 bursts min(?1)) (P = 0.020), as well as higher MSNA burst incidence and total activity. Resting HR, SBP and DBP were not different. During CPT, there were no differences in MSNA, HR, SBP or DBP between groups. COV+ participants reported less pain during the CPT compared with CON (5.7  1.8 vs. 7.2  1.9 a.u., P = 0.036). MSNA was higher in COV+ compared with CON during HUT. There was a group\\\\by\\\\position interaction in MSNA burst incidence, as well as HR, in response to HUT. These results indicate resting sympathetic activity, but not HR or BP, may be elevated following SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. Further, cardiovascular and perceptual responses to physiological stress may be altered, including both exaggerated (orthostasis) and suppressed (pain perception) responses, compared with healthy young adults.","output":"COVID\\\\19 is getting on our nerves: sympathetic neural activity and haemodynamics in young adults recovering from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the early stages of infection, SARS-CoV produces more severe perturbation of host cell gene expression in a human epithelial cell line of liver origin than the HCoV-229E.","output":"Comparative host gene transcription by microarray analysis early after infection of the Huh7 cell line by SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis unprecedented in its size and scope. Yet studies of resilience suggest most individuals will successfully negotiate this challenge and some may even experience growth and positive change. Some evidence suggests that the capacity to enact positive change in the face of adversity may be shaped by early life experiences. METHODS: In a subset of 374 participants (57% female, mean age = 29 years) in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), a longitudinal, birth cohort, prospective models were tested to determine whether early life adversities in family and neighborhood contexts predict positive change events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Childhood family and neighborhood contexts were assessed using a combination of self-report questionnaires and US Census data. Adulthood positive change events (e.g., becoming more appreciative of things usually taken for granted) were assessed using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII). RESULTS: In regression analyses, neighborhood disadvantage in childhood, measured both by objective and subjective assessments, predicted a higher number of positive change events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic ( = .18, p = .004 and  = .15, p = .006, respectively). Examination of the positive change event subscales showed neighborhood disadvantage in childhood predicted increases in events related to perspective taking and charitable giving ( = .20, p = .022 and  = .17, p = .002, respectively) and improved social relationships ( = .18, p = .004 and  = .13, p = .020, respectively), but not to positive health behaviors (ps > .05). All associations were independent of sociodemographic factors and childhood family dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that neighborhood disadvantage in childhood may shape prosocial responses to stress in adulthood, potentially through early life adaptions to stress that are protective when facing adversity. There are several notable implications of the study findings. Although adversity in early life has clear negative impacts, it is possible that adversity experiences may also provide opportunities to develop adaptive strategies that foster resilience and growth when facing stress. Intervention efforts should consider leveraging such stress-adapted strengths to reduce the many negative impacts of early life adversity.","output":"Early life predictors of positive change during the coronavirus disease pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the research and development of the SwapMyMood smartphone application designed to support use of evidence-based executive function strategies by people with traumatic brain injury.

No literature describes outcomes in ICU patients with COVID-19 managed by an acute care surgery (ACS) division. Our ACS division manages all ICU patients at a community hospital in New Jersey. When that hospital was overwhelmed and in crisis secondary to COVID-19, we sought to describe outcomes for all patients with COVID-19 admitted to our closed ICU managed by the ACS division. METHODS: This was a prospective case series of the first 120 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted on March 14 to May 10, 2020. Final follow-up was May 27, 2020. Patients discharged from the ICU or who died were included. Patients still admitted to the ICU at final follow-up were excluded. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients were included (median age 64 years (range 25C89), 66.7% men). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (75; 62.5%), obesity (61; 50.8%), and diabetes (50; 41.7%). One hundred and thirteen (94%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 89 (74.2%) had shock, and 76 (63.3%) experienced acute kidney injury. One hundred (83.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Median ICU length of stay (LOS) was 8.5 days (IQR 9), hospital LOS was 14.5 days (IQR 13). Mortality for all ICU patients with COVID-19 was 53.3% and 62% for IMV patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a community hospital ICU managed by an ACS division who also provided all surge care. Mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to an overwhelmed hospital in crisis may not be as high as initially thought based on prior reports. While COVID-19 is a non-surgical disease, ACS divisions have the capability of successfully caring for both surgical and medical critically ill patients, thus providing versatility in times of crisis.

To analyze the relative sensitivity of the predicted hydrophobic face of the N-terminal heptad repeat to the insertion of uncharged, polar, and charged substitutions, mutations that introduced alanine, serine, or glutamic acid into positions 436, 443, 450, and 457 of the envelope protein were examined. Novel systems using Tat protein and the GHOST cell line were developed to test and quantitate the effects of the mutations on Env-mediated fusion and infectivity of the virus. While no single amino acid change at any of the positions interfered significantly with the synthesis, processing, or transport to the plasma membrane of glycoprotein complexes, 9 of the 12 nonconservative mutations in these residues completely abolished fusion activity and virus infectivity. Mutations in the central positions (443 and 450) of the heptad repeat region were the most detrimental to Env function, and even single alanine substitutions in these positions dramatically altered the fusogenicity of the protein. These results demonstrate that this N-terminal heptad repeat plays a critical role in Env-mediated membrane fusion and highlight the key function of central hydrophobic residues in this process and the sensitivity of all positions to charge substitutions.","output":"Variable sensitivity to substitutions in the N-terminal heptad repeat of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus transmembrane protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a major burden on personal health, healthcare systems and the global economy.

METHODS: We performed an electronic in Pubmed and Global Index Medicus on 01 July 2019 and manual search. We performed search of studies that have detected common respiratory viruses in children 18 years with wheezing. We included only studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Study data were extracted and the quality of articles assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroup, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effects model. RESULTS: The systematic review included 33 studies. Rhinovirus, with a prevalence of 35.6% (95% CI 24.6C47.3, I(2) 98.4%), and respiratory syncytial virus, at 31.0% (95% CI 19.9C43.3, I(2) 96.4%), were the most common viruses detected. The prevalence of other respiratory viruses was as follows: human bocavirus 8.1% (95% CI 5.3C11.3, I(2) 84.6%), human adenovirus 7.7% (95% CI 2.6C15.0, I(2) 91.0%), influenza virus6.5% (95% CI 2.2C12.6, I(2) 92.4%), human metapneumovirus5.8% (95% CI 3.4C8.8, I(2) 89.0%), enterovirus 4.3% (95% CI 0.1C12.9, I(2) 96.2%), human parainfluenza virus 3.8% (95% CI 1.5C6.9, I(2) 79.1%), and human coronavirus 2.2% (95% CI 0.6C4.4, I(2) 79.4%).

People living with NCDs could face challenges owing to restricted mobility, low access to medical care and suboptimal logistics during the pandemic. The present study explored the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on NCD care in a district of Odisha State of India. METHODS: This study was carried out during May-June 2020 in the Khurda district of Odisha. A community-based explanatory mixed-method study was followed. Data collection comprised 12 in-depth interviews and 491 structured interviews using Likert-questionnaire with individuals having at least one NCD. Mantel-Haenszel's Chi-square test was used to assess the difference in the effect of COVID-19 on the routine NCD care. Qualitative data were analyzed by content analysis. RESULTS: Findings revealed that nearly two-thirds of participants encountered challenges in their routine investigation (69%), day-care procedures (67%) and reaching hospital (61%). Around half of them reported having trouble in doctor appointments (59%), emergency treatment (56%), access to the pharmacy (47%) and delay in healthcare (46%). Thirty seven per cent perceived that they could not access care because of social restriction/lockdown, 29 per cent attributed arranging finance as a constraint to visiting hospitals and 16 per cent avoided going to the hospital, fearing COVID-19 infection.

To understand the changes in the emoji usage of internet users during the COVID-19 outbreak, we analysed a large dataset collected from Weibo, the most popular Twitter-like social media platform in China, from December 1, 2019, to March 20, 2020. The data contained 38,183,194 microblog posts published by 2,239,472 unique users in Wuhan. We calculated the basic statistics of users usage of emojis, topics, and sentiments and analysed the temporal patterns of emoji occurrence. After examining the emoji co-occurrence structure, we finally explored other factors that may affect individual emoji usage. We found that the COVID-19 outbreak greatly changed the pattern of emoji usage; i.e., both the proportion of posts containing emojis and the ratio of users using emojis declined substantially, while the number of posts remained the same. The daily proportion of Happy emojis significantly declined to approximately 32%, but the proportions of Sad- and Encouraging-related emojis rose to 24% and 34%, respectively. Despite a significant decrease in the number of nodes and edges in the emoji co-occurrence network, the average degree of the network increased from 34 to 39.8, indicating that the diversity of emoji usage increased. Most interestingly, we found that male users were more inclined towards using regular textual language with fewer emojis after the pandemic, suggesting that during public crises, male groups appeared to control their emotional display.

Postoperatively, 25% of patients filled &#8805;1 opioid prescription; mean duration of use was 13  11 days, and 362 patients (0.7%) had chronic use. Patients with preoperative depression were less likely than patients without depression to fill an opioid prescription postoperatively (OR 0.2, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.2). Of patients who filled opioid prescriptions postoperatively, those with preoperative depression were more likely to refill that prescription at least once (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.9, 2.2) but did not have greater odds of chronic use (OR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.5). Preoperative depression was not associated with greater cumulative opioid consumption from 3-12 months postoperatively (? = -40, 95% CI: -226, 146). Conclusion: Although patients with preoperative depression were more likely to take opioids preoperatively and to obtain &#8805;1 opioid refill postoperatively, they did not have greater odds of chronic postoperative opioid use or greater cumulative opioid consumption after ACL reconstruction.","output":"Associations Between Preoperative Depression and Opioid Use After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and Concomitant Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of subjects are recovering from COVID-19, raising the need for tools to adequately assess the course of the disease and its impact on functional status. We aimed to assess the construct validity of the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Scale among adult subjects with confirmed and presumed COVID-19. METHODS: Adult subjects with confirmed and presumed COVID-19, who were members of an online panel and two Facebook groups for subjects with COVID-19 with persistent symptoms, completed an online survey after the onset of infection-related symptoms. The number and intensity of symptoms were evaluated with the Utrecht Symptom Diary, health-related quality of life (HrQoL) with the 5-level EQ-5D questionnaire, impairment in work and activities with the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire and functional status with the PCFS Scale. RESULTS: 1939 subjects were included in the analyses (85% women, 95% non-hospitalized during infection) about 3 months after the onset of infection-related symptoms. Subjects classified as experiencing slight, moderate and severe functional limitations presented a gradual increase in the number/intensity of symptoms, reduction of HrQoL and impairment in work and usual activities. No differences were found regarding the number and intensity of symptoms, HrQoL and impairment in work and usual activities between subjects classified as experiencing negligible and no functional limitations. We found weak-to-strong statistical associations between functional status and all domains of HrQoL (r: 0.233C0.661). Notably, the strongest association found was with the usual activities domain of the 5-level EQ-5D questionnaire.

Our goal was to conduct a molecular epidemiologic study to detect the presence of HRSV and HMPV in fecal samples from wild human-habituated free-ranging mountain gorillas in Rwanda and to evaluate the role of these viruses in RI outbreaks. Fecal samples were collected from gorillas with clinical signs of RI between June 2012 and February 2013 and tested by real-time and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays; comparison fecal samples were obtained from gorillas without clinical signs of RI sampled during the 2010 Virunga gorilla population census. PCR assays detected HMPV and HRSV first in spiked samples; subsequently, HRSV-A, the worldwide-circulating ON1 genotype, was detected in 12 of 20 mountain gorilla fecal samples collected from gorillas with RI during outbreaks, but not in samples from animals without respiratory illness. Our findings confirmed that pathogenic human respiratory viruses are transmitted to gorillas and that they are repeatedly introduced into mountain gorilla populations from people, attesting to the need for stringent biosecurity measures for the protection of gorilla health.","output":"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Detected in Mountain Gorilla Respiratory Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The variation in skin textures and injuries, as well as the detection and classification of skin cancer, is a difficult task. Manually detecting skin lesions from dermoscopy images is a difficult and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in the domains of the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence for medical applications demonstrated improvements in both accuracy and computational time. In this paper, a new method for multiclass skin lesion classification using best deep learning feature fusion and an extreme learning machine is proposed. The proposed method includes five primary steps: image acquisition and contrast enhancement; deep learning feature extraction using transfer learning; best feature selection using hybrid whale optimization and entropy-mutual information (EMI) approach; fusion of selected features using a modified canonical correlation based approach; and, finally, extreme learning machine based classification. The feature selection step improves the systems computational efficiency and accuracy. The experiment is carried out on two publicly available datasets, HAM10000 and ISIC2018. The achieved accuracy on both datasets is 93.40 and 94.36 percent. When compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, the proposed methods accuracy is improved.

Empirical data show that the characteristics of the effects of the virus do vary between the two periods. Differences in age range and severity of the disease have been reported, although the comparative characteristics of the two waves still remain largely unknown. Those characteristics are compared in this study using data from two equal periods of 3 and a half months. The first period, between 15th March and 30th June, corresponding to the entire first wave, and the second, between 1st July and 15th October, corresponding to part of the second wave, still present at the time of writing this article. Two hundred and four patients were hospitalized during the first period, and 264 during the second period. Patients in the second wave were younger and the duration of hospitalization and case fatality rate were lower than those in the first wave. In the second wave, there were more children, and pregnant and post-partum women. The most frequent signs and symptoms in both waves were fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cough, and the most relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic neurological diseases. Patients from the second wave more frequently presented renal and gastrointestinal symptoms, were more often treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and corticoids, and less often with invasive mechanical ventilation, conventional oxygen therapy and anticoagulants. Several differences in mortality risk factors were also observed. These results might help to understand the characteristics of the second wave and the behaviour and danger of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mediterranean area and in Western Europe.

SFTS is mainly prevalent in East Asia. It has a mortality rate of up to 30%, and there is no approved treatment against the disease. In this study, we evaluated the effect of loperamide, an antidiarrheal and antihyperalgesic agent, on the propagation of SFTSV in a cell culture system. Methods: SFTSV-infected human cell lines were exposed to loperamide, and viral titers were evaluated. To clarify the mode of action of loperamide, several chemical compounds having shared targets with loperamide were used. Calcium imaging was also performed to understand whether loperamide treatment affected calcium influx. Results: Loperamide inhibited SFTSV propagation in several cell lines. It inhibited SFTSV in the post-entry step and restricted calcium influx into the cell. Furthermore, nifedipine, a calcium channel inhibitor, also blocked post-entry step of SFTSV infection. Conclusions: Loperamide inhibits SFTSV propagation mainly by restraining calcium influx into the cytoplasm.

METHODS: To address this question and identify gaps in knowledge, we utilized the methodology of a scoping review to interrogate risk of infection and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with iatrogenic and inborn humoral immunodeficiency states based on existing literature. RESULTS: Among patients with iatrogenic B-cell depletion, particularly with agents targeting CD20, our analysis found increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death across a range of underlying disease states. Among patients with humoral inborn errors of immunity with COVID-19, our synthesis found that patients with dysregulated humoral immunity, predominantly common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than patients with humoral immunodeficiency states due to X-linked agammaglobulinemia and other miscellaneous forms of humoral immunodeficiency. There were insufficient data to appraise the risk of COVID-19 infection in both populations of patients.

However, there are few comprehensive reviews and studies focusing on its evolution and reform. It is worthwhile to pay attention to the public health development in China, given that the history and structure of public health system have their own characteristics in China. METHODS The study is a retrospective review of the development public health over seven decades in China. It presents the findings from some national or provincial survey data, interviews with key informants, reviews of relevant published papers and policy contents. RESULTS This study identified four key stages that public health experienced in China: the initial stage centering on prevention, the stage of deviation with more attention to treatment but little to prevention, the recovery stage after SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes) Crisis, and the new stage to an equitable and people-centered system. In the latest stage, the National Basic Public Health Service Program (NBPHSP) is implemented to respond the threat of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and has achieved some initial results, while there are still many challenges including service quality, poor integration among service items and IT system, lack of quality professionals and insufficient intersectoral endeavor. DISCUSSION There are unique Chinese wisdom and remarkable achievements as well as twists and turns on the development of China's public health. Prevention-first, flexible structure of the system, multi-agency collaboration and mass mobilization and society participation are the main experience of public health in early stage. Despite twists and turns since 1980s, public health system in China shows substantial resilience which may be from the government's continuous commitment to social development and people's livelihoods and its flexible governance. In 2010s, in order to achieve the well-off society, Chinese government pays unprecedented attention to health sector, which bring a new wave of opportunities to public health such as remaining the NBPHSP for priority. The evolution and reform of China's public health is based on its national condition, accumulates rich experience but also faces many common worldwide challenges. Getting this development and reform right is important to China's social and economic development in future, and China's experience in public health may provide many lessons for other countries. CONCLUSION Public health in China needs to focus on prevention, strengthen multi-agency coordination mechanism, improve the quality of public health services in the future.","output":"The development and reform of public health in China from 1949 to 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A terrible pandemic, Covid-19, has captivated scientists to investigate if SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the central nervous system (CNS). A crucial question is if acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the main cause of death in this pandemic, and often refractory to treatments, can be explained by respiratory center dysfunction. Objective To discuss that ARDS can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory center in the brainstem. Materials and Methods I reviewed literature about SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms to infect the respiratory center in the brainstem. Results and Conclusions An increasing amount of reports demonstrates that neurotropism is a common feature of coronavirus, which have been found in the brains of patients and experimental models, where the brainstem was severely infested. Recent studies have provided tremendous indication of the incidence of acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brainstem. SARS-CoV-2 might infect the CNS through the olfactory bulb, spreading from the olfactory nerves to the rhinencephalon, and finally reaching the brainstem. Hence, the virus infection causes respiratory center dysfunctions, leading to ARDS in COVID-19 patients. I conclude that acute ARDS in Covid-19 can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 invasion of brainstem respiratory center, suggesting the needs of more specific and aggressive treatments, with the direct participation of neurologists and neurointensivists.","output":"Brainstem Dysfunction in SARS-COV-2 Infection can be a Potential Cause of Respiratory Distress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to collect information on the opinions of Korean infectious disease (ID) experts on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related issues in preparation for a future outbreak.

An online-based survey was forwarded via text message and e-mail. Only one response was accepted from each participant. RESULTS: Of these 265 ID specialists gotten to, 132 (49.8%) responded. The highest proportion of the respondents envisaged the current COVID-19 outbreak to end after December 2020 (47.7% for the domestic Korean outbreak and 70.5% for the global pandemic); moreover, 60.7% of them stated that a second nationwide wave is likely to occur between September and December 2020 in South Korea. N95 respirators were considered to be the most important item in hospitals in preparation for a second wave. The most important policy to be implemented at the national level was securing national hospitals designated for the treatment of ID (67.4%). CONCLUSIONS: ID experts in South Korea believe that the COVID-19 pandemic may not be easily controlled and that a second nationwide wave is likely to occur in South Korea.

Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a healthcare professional would be more preferable for patients and health professionals.

We evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on two different saliva collection devices (spitting versus swabbing) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs in over 2500 individuals that were either symptomatic or had high-risk contacts with infected individuals. We observed an overall poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (30.8% and 22.4% for spitting and swabbing, respectively). However, when focusing on individuals with medium to high viral load, sensitivity increased substantially (97.0% and 76.7% for spitting and swabbing, respectively), irrespective of symptomatic status.

In this scoping review, we aim to explore whether information needs in DCM are currently being met in available DCM educational resources. This forms part of a larger Myelopathy.org project to promote shared decision making in DCM. METHODS: A search was completed encompassing MEDLINE, Embase and grey literature. Resources relevant to DCM were compiled for analysis. Resources were grouped into 5 information types: scientific literature, videos, organisations, health education websites and patient information leaflets. Resources were then further arranged into a hierarchical framework of domains and subdomains, formed through inductive analysis. Frequency statistics were employed to capture relative popularity as a surrogate marker of potential significance. RESULTS: Of 2674 resources, 150 information resources addressing DCM were identified: 115 scientific literature resources, 28 videos, 5 resources from health organisations and 2 resources from health education websites. Surgical management was the domain with the largest number of resources (66.7%, 100/150). The domain with the second largest number of resources was clinical presentation and natural history (28.7%, 43/150). Most resources (83.3%, 125/150) were designed for professionals. A minority (11.3% 17/150) were written for a lay audience or for a combined audience (3.3%, 5/150).

Iron deficiency can have detrimental health effects when left untreated. Donation intervals are commonly too short to replenish iron stores and extending these reduces donor availability. Oral iron supplementation is known to shorten iron store recovery time but may also induce gastrointestinal complaints. We aim to optimise the effectiveness of iron supplements while minimising the risks of side effects. Therefore, we will evaluate the impact of different iron supplementation protocols in terms of dosage and frequency on ferritin and haemoglobin levels, gastrointestinal side effects, iron deficiency-related symptoms and donor return compared with placebo supplementation. METHODS: Twelve hundred whole blood donors with ferritin levels 30 g/L are included into a double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Participants are randomly allocated to one of six arms, administering capsules containing 0 mg, 30 mg or 60 mg of iron, either on alternate days or daily for 56 days.

In 2020, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized hundreds of thousands of specific predictions from more than 50 different academic, industry, and independent research groups.

One of these models was a multi-model ensemble that combined all available forecasts each week. The performance of individual models showed high variability across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Half of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a naive baseline model. In combining the forecasts from all teams, the ensemble showed the best overall probabilistic accuracy of any model.

The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports initiated and developed CoronaMelder, a COVID-19 contact tracing app. This app is based on a Google/Apple Exposure Notification approach and aims to combat the spread of the coronavirus among individuals by notifying those who are at increased risk of infection due to proximity to someone who later tests positive for COVID-19. The app should support traditional contact tracing by faster tracing and greater reach compared to regular contact tracing procedures. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study is to investigate whether the CoronaMelder is able to support traditional contact tracing employed by public health authorities. To achieve this, usability tests were conducted to answer the following question: is the CoronaMelder user-friendly, understandable, reliable and credible, and inclusive? METHODS: Participants (N=44) of different backgrounds were recruited: youth with varying educational levels, youth with an intellectual disability, migrants, adults (aged 40-64 years), and older adults (aged >65 years) via convenience sampling in the region of Twente in the Netherlands. The app was evaluated with scenario-based, think-aloud usability tests and additional interviews. Findings were recorded via voice recordings, observation notes, and the Dutch User Experience Questionnaire, and some participants wore eye trackers to measure gaze behavior. RESULTS: Our results showed that the app is easy to use, although problems occurred with understandability and accessibility. Older adults and youth with a lower education level did not understand why or under what circumstances they would receive notifications, why they must share their key (ie, their assigned identifier), and what happens after sharing. In particular, youth in the lower-education category did not trust or understand Bluetooth signals, or comprehend timing and follow-up activities after a risk exposure notification. Older adults had difficulties multitasking (speaking with a public health worker and simultaneously sharing the key in the app). Public health authorities appeared to be unprepared to receive support from the app during traditional contact tracing because their telephone conversation protocol lacks guidance, explanation, and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that the CoronaMelder app is easy to use, but participants experienced misunderstandings about its functioning. The perceived lack of clarity led to misconceptions about the app, mostly regarding its usefulness and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Tailored and targeted communication through, for example, public campaigns or social media, is necessary to provide correct information about the app to residents in the Netherlands. Additionally, the app should be presented as part of the national coronavirus measures instead of as a stand-alone app offered to the public.

The receptor binding protein of parainfluenza forms a complex with the fusion protein of the virus, remaining stably associated until a receptor is reached. At that point, the receptor binding protein actively triggers the fusion protein to undergo a series of transitions that ultimately lead to membrane fusion and viral entry.

We sought to determine whether differences in instruction types at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year were related to differences in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Illinois counties during the first three weeks of the school year. METHODS: We divided Illinois counties into three groups based on the instruction type used for a majority of K-12 students at the start of the school year: in-person, hybrid, or online-only. We used synthetic control analysis to match counties between the three groups. RESULTS: Both majority hybrid and majority online-only counties had significantly fewer new cases than majority in-person counties. There were no significant differences in new cases between majority hybrid counties and majority online-only counties or in new hospital admissions or deaths between any of the three county groups.

This study aimed to compare a new robotic spine platform from Fusion Robotics(TM )(Fusion Robotics, Helena, MT) with the widely used Mazor-X(TM) Stealth Edition robotic platform (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) in terms of workflow and lumbar pedicle screw placement accuracy. Methods A cadaver lab was conducted, which included four procedures with single-level lumbar pedicle screw placement using the Fusion Robotics(TM) system. These four procedures were compared to four propensity-score matched cases with single-level lumbar pedicle screw placement using the Mazor-X(TM) Stealth Edition. A single surgeon performed all surgeries. The cases were matched in terms of demographics (age, sex, race, BMI) and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score). The primary outcome measure was the operative workflow efficiency (duration as measured with a stopwatch by an independent observer). The secondary outcome measures were pedicle screw accuracy and accuracy to plan. Results After propensity-score matching, there were four cases in each group with no significant between-group differences in terms of sex, race, BMI, or surgical levels; however, there were significant differences in terms of age (p=0.01) and comorbidities (p<0.001). The workflow efficiency measurement showed that the Fusion Robotics(TM) platform had a significantly shorter duration in terms of the system set-up time, planning to in-position time, and total procedure time (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the robotic platforms in terms of creating a sterile barrier, scanning and importing images, creating a plan, screw placement, screw accuracy, and screw accuracy to plan. Conclusion Based on our findings, the Fusion Robotics(TM) platform had a significantly shorter procedure workflow duration while maintaining the same accuracy as the most commonly used robotic platform (Mazor-X(TM)). This is the first study to directly compare different spine surgery robotic systems.","output":"Accuracy and Efficiency of Fusion Robotics?

In the current study, we aim to explore the relationship between admission F-NLR score and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and assess its prognostic predictive ability in ICH patients. METHODS: The original cohort was consecutively recruited from August 2014 to September 2017, and the validation cohort was consecutively recruited between October 2018 and March 2020. The primary outcomes were 3-month functional outcome and 1-month mortality. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS and R software. RESULTS: A total of 431 and 251 ICH patients were included in original cohort and validation cohort, respectively. In the original cohort, F-NLR score could independently predict the 3-month functional outcome (adjusted OR 2.013, 95% CI 1.316-3.078, p = 0.001) and 1-month mortality (adjusted OR 3.036, 95% CI 1.965-4.693, p < 0.001). Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analyses and predictive model comparison indicated that F-NLR score had a stronger predictive ability in the 3-month outcome and 1-month mortality. Validation cohort verified the results. CONCLUSION: F-NLR score was an independent indicator for both the 3-month functional outcome and 1-month mortality, and its prognostic predictive ability was superior to fibrinogen and NLR in both the original and the validation cohort.","output":"Prognostic Significance of the Combined Score of Plasma Fibrinogen and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in Patients with Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a close connection between health and the quality of ones social life. Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often health conditions can detrimentally affect a persons ability to interact with others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health. For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below. We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform, motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have. In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform: (a) changing how the person is perceived, (b) enhancing the social behavior of the person, (c) modifying the social behavior of others, (d) providing structure for interactions, and (e) changing how the person feels. We thematically organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting humanChuman interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.","output":"Assistive Robots for the Social Management of Health: A Framework for Robot Design and HumanCRobot Interaction Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Impaired mucociliary clearance may increase COPD exacerbation risk.

In this cross-sectional study, 16 COPD patients and 12 controls underwent bronchial brushings. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and dyskinesia index (DI; % of dyskinetic cilia) were assessed using digital high-speed video microscopy, and epithelial ultrastructure using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Bronchial epithelium in COPD showed lower CBF and higher DI, compared to controls (median [IQR] CBF: 6.8 (6.1-7.2) Hz vs 8.5 (7.7-8.9) Hz, p<0.001 and DI: 73.8 (60.7-89.8) % vs 14.5 (11.2-16.9) %, p<0.001, respectively).

Telemedicine may be a viable option to continue hospital workflow, however there are barriers to its implementation. We set out to establish what barriers might exist and to assess the viability of teleclinics within the province KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), as perceived by doctors. METHODS: This was a quantitative, observational, survey-based study targeted at medical doctors working in both the public as well as the private healthcare sector in University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). RESULTS: One hundred and forty-seven (147) responses were included. The majority (86%) of respondents felt that telemedicine could provide a useful means to continuing hospital workflow, however, only 47% believed that it was a viable option for their unit. The major barrier identified was a feeling that doctors would-be at-increased medico-legal risk. Only 38.4% of doctors were familiar with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) guidelines on telemedicine usage. Other major barriers included: doctors feeling uncomfortable with not seeing a patient in person or not being able to perform a thorough physical examination. Other reasons identified as potential barriers were doctors foreseeing difficulty in accessing patient medical records and the absence of available systems to order investigations without the patient being physically present. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is currently not widely utilised in KZN; although most doctors were of the opinion that it could be a useful tool in order to continue the workflow during the pandemic.

This study was carried out in September 2020, the last month of the first state of national emergency. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated, including COVID-19 status and cancer treatment features. Results A total of 1472 patients were included;the median age was 55 years (range 19C97). Most patients (85.8%, n = 1263) had solid neoplasia, 13.5% (n = 198) hematologic neoplasia, and 0.7% (n = 11) others. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 8.6% (n = 126), 1.2% (n = 18) were probable, 1.6% (n = 24) suspected, and 88.6% (n = 1304) negative cases. Overall, 51.6% of patients (n = 759) had cancer treatment delays, 42.5% (n = 626) changed treatment delivery (endovenous to oral systemic therapy), and 12.6% (n = 185) of cases cancer therapy was discontinued. In total, 10.3% (n = 117) of patients whose disease was controlled or in remission, experienced progression of disease during the state of emergency. A total of 6.7% (n = 98) of patients died, of whom 73.5% (n = 72) died from disease progression; 18.4% (n = 18) from SARS-CoV-2 infection and 8.1% (n = 8) from undetermined causes.

For this reason, unsupervised and exploratory methods represent a fundamental tool to deal with the analysis of multivariate time series. In this paper we propose a deep-learning based framework for clustering multivariate time series data with varying lengths. Our framework, namely DeTSEC (Deep Time Series Embedding Clustering), includes two stages: firstly a recurrent autoencoder exploits attention and gating mechanisms to produce a preliminary embedding representation; then, a clustering refinement stage is introduced to stretch the embedding manifold towards the corresponding clusters.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The sample consisted of 30 patients with overdentures, who were selected from the dental records filed at the institution. Data on general health and the dental implants involved (brand, type of prosthetic connection, number of implants, and additional overdenture retention system) were collected from the medical records. The 30 patients were invited to answer the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires, and due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was possible to contact 15 patients. RESULTS Most of the prostheses studied were mandibular overdentures, and 66.66% of the cases were retained by the O-ring system. As for the oral health self-perception of the individuals, it was concluded that male patients had a lower mean overall score (p = 0.047) and functional domain (p = 0.042) in the OHIP-14. The number of implants and the installation arch interfered with functional domain and psychological capacity (p <0.05). The VAS showed that women have greater esthetic satisfaction with prostheses (p = 0.048) and that the bar-clip retention system is more satisfactory than the O-ring (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION Despite the limitations of overdentures, it was noted that, when properly indicated, they are a viable option for oral rehabilitation on implants.

METHODS: From March 17 to April 7, 2020, a real-world observational retrospective analysis of consecutive hospitalized adult patients receiving TCZ to treat severe COVID-19 was conducted at our 750-bed university hospital. The main outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,092 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period. Of them, 186 (17%) were treated with TCZ, of which 129 (87.8%) in combination with CS. Of the total 186, 155 (83.3 %) patients were receiving non-invasive ventilation when TCZ was initiated. Mean time from symptoms onset and hospital admission to TCZ use was 12 ( 4.3) and 4.3 days ( 3.4), respectively. Overall, 147 (79%) survived and 39 (21%) died. By multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (HR = 1.09, p < 0.001), chronic heart failure (HR = 4.4, p = 0.003), and chronic liver disease (HR = 4.69, p = 0.004).

As with other types of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 affects children less frequently, and it has been observed that the disease is mild. In the pathogenesis of a standard viral infection, the pathogen's contact with the mucosa is initially followed by an innate immunity response. T cells are the primary decisive element in adaptive immunity capability. For this reason, the adaptive immune response mediated by the thymus is a process that regulates the immune response responsible for preventing invasive damage from a virus. Regulatory T cells (T-reg) are active during the early periods of life and have precise roles in immunomodulation. The thymus is highly active in the intrauterine and neonatal period; it begins to shrink after birth and continues its activity until adolescence. The loss of T-reg function by age results in difficulty with the control of the immune response, increased inflammation as shown in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as an inflammatory storm. Also, the thymus is typically able to replace the T cells destroyed by apoptosis caused by the virus. Thymus and T cells are the key factors of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in children.Conclusion: We speculated that thymus activity and T lymphocyte function in children protect them against the virus effects. Stimulating and preventing the inhibition of the thymus can be possible treatment components against COVID-19. What is Known: a?

We aim to summarize early CT findings to inform healthcare providers on the frequency of COVID-19 manifestations specific to adult or pediatric patients, and to determine if the sensitivity of CT justifies its use in these populations. Methods PubMed was searched for the presence of the words CT, imaging, COVID-19 in the title or abstract, and 17 large-scale PubMed and/or Scopus studies and case reports published between January 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were selected for data synthesis. Results Initial CT scans identified ground-glass opacities and bilateral abnormalities as more frequent in adults (74%, n = 698, and 89%, n = 378, respectively) than children (60%, n = 25, and 37%, n = 46). At 14+ days, CT scans evidenced varied degrees of improvement in adults but no resolution until at least 26 days after the onset of flu-like symptoms. In pediatric patients, a third (n = 9) showed additional small nodular GGOs limited to a single lobe 3-5 days after an initial CT scan. Conclusin Early adult CT findings suggest the limited use of CT as a supplemental tool in diagnosing COVID-19 in symptomatic adult patients, with a particular focus on identifying right and left lower lobe abnormalities, GGOs, and interlobular septal thickening. Early pediatric CT findings suggest against the use of CT if RT-PCR is available given its significantly lower sensitivity in this population and radiation exposure.","output":"CT Presentations of Adult and Pediatric SARS-COV-2 Patients: A Review of Early COVID-19 Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees worked from home in record numbers and enjoyed extraordinarily high levels of autonomy.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old male in the inpatient service of our hospital complained of vomiting for two weeks. The patient had a long hospital stay in our center for the management of trauma-related complications, which resulted in significant weight loss despite the parenteral nutrition as he was unable for taking the enteral nutrition due to severe facial traumatic injury. In oral contrast study, the proximal duodenal segments were dilated. The contrast media could not reach the duodenojejunal junction in the supine position, though a small amount of the contras passed the distal duodenal part on repositioning the patient to prone. On abdominal CT images, the angle and distance between the superior mesenteric artery and the abdominal aorta were decreased to 20. 8(0), and 7.3 mm respectively. The findings were consistent with the superior mesenteric artery compression syndrome. He underwent a mini-laparotomy for the placement of a jejunostomy feeding tube aiming to promote weight gain and mesenteric fat restoration for preventing the SMA compression effects on the duodenum. DISCUSSION: The decrease in retroperitoneal fat owing to weight loss may result in aortomesenteric angle reduction and duodenal compression. Prompt nutritional support and timely diagnosis may preclude the need for more invasive surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare condition, often resulting in small bowel obstruction. The clinical symptoms of this syndrome are nonspecific, which may underestimate the diagnosis. However, clinical suspicion supported by imaging study may help the accurate diagnosis.

Favipiravir (FVP) triphosphate, a purine nucleoside analog, inhibits that enzyme. We have conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of the drug FVP as a treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: Databases like Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, preprint sites, and clinicaltirals.gov were searched. The studies with the standard of care (SOC) and FVP as a treatment drug were considered as the treatment group and the SOC with other antivirals and supportive care as the control group. Quantitative synthesis was done using RevMan 5.4. Clinical improvement, negative conversion of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), adverse effects, and oxygen requirements were studied. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1798 studies after searching the electronic databases. Nine in the qualitative studies and four studies in the quantitative synthesis met the criteria. There was a significant clinical improvement in the FVP group on the 14th day compared to the control group (RR 1.29, 1.08-1.54). Clinical deterioration rates were less likely in the FVP group though statistically not significant (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30-1.14) at the endpoint of study (7-15 days). The meta-analysis showed no significant differences between the two groups on viral clearance (day 14: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84-1.33), non-invasive ventilation or oxygen requirement (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.42-1.39), and adverse effects (OR 0.69, 0.13-3.57). There are 31 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) registered in different parts of the world focusing FVP for COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSION: There is a significant clinical and radiological improvement following treatment with FVP in comparison to the standard of care with no significant differences on viral clearance, oxygen support requirement and side effect profiles.","output":"Favipiravir versus other antiviral or standard of care for COVID-19 treatment: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 pandemic disrupted heath care system all around the world and overwhelmed the capacity of hospital to manage regular patients including cancer patients. We implemented a new program to help managing oncology patients visited our Emergency Rooms (ER) and discharged home. Methods Our home care program designed to cover all aspects of patients care while they are at home by checking the ER list on daily basis and identify all oncology patients on this list. We developed an algorithm, to follow up our patients and the COVID-19 test status and to act accordingly (figure 1). The team consists of oncologist, oncology nurse specialists, patient educator and data management person. The primary oncologist of each patient is notified and consulted on the plan. The team follows the result and decide further steps of management accordingly. The intervention includes regular clinical assessment by calling the patient, arranging medication delivery, sending patients brochures explaining the necessary protective measured needs to be taken by patient and care givers and respond to patient and family queries and concerns. Results Between May 31 and July 31, 237 oncology patients seen in ED with different clinical presentations. One hundred forty two patients did not need admission and therefore discharged home. COVID-19 test was carried out according to the presenting symptoms and ARI score (test requested if score is 4 or more). Only 30 patients (21%) needed COVID-19 testing prior to discharge from ED and 6 patients tested positive. However, on our follow of those patients at home further 16 patients (11%) needed to be tested due to new developments of their symptoms and 3 patients tested positive. The main reasons for nor requesting COVID-19 for some patients either 1) recent testing in outpatient clinics or other health centers outside our institution Ministry of Health, 2) they are known to have covid-19 and still in active infection, 3) based on patient's MRP decision not to swab patient for COVID -19. During our daily monitoring of patients at their homes, 12 patients (8%) were called back due to worsening of their symptoms and needed further assessment and management after discussion with their MRP. As per our infection control department guidelines, repeating COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic patients was not necessary and patient can be discharged from our records. This new model of care in our institution was presented to the COVID-19 pandemic command center and the program got the approval and recommended to be implemented in other departments as per patients need. Conclusion Oncology patients are vulnerable especially at this time of COVID-19 pandemic and our program is designed to reduce the risk of exposure and infection by looking after those patient while they are at home in addition to maintain the continuity of their cancer management.

Design/methodology/approach In total, 237 consumers from Serbia were online surveyed during November 2020. Starting from the methodology of the SOR model (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974), the questionnaire consists of seven-point Likert scale statements that measure risk perceptions and precautions as stimulus (S), eating habits as an organism (O) and food choice, precautions during shopping for food and food purchasing patterns as a response (S). Findings Research results confirm the difference in consumers' eating habits during and before a pandemic. Also, results indicate that perceived risk and precautions related to the COVID-19 virus have a statistically significant influence on consumers' eating habits which have changed during a pandemic, finally resulting in significant effects on consumers' food shopping behaviour. Research limitations/implications The main limitations of this study are observing only a few aspects related to COVID-19 virus pandemic and consumer food shopping behaviour, as well as measuring precautions, perceived risk and food shopping behaviour at one point in time besides the fact that pandemic situation constantly changes.

Compared to the medium from untreated MSCs, inflammatory factors elevated statistically in the medium from MS-MSCs. Moreover, the paracellular permeability of endothelial cells treated with LPS was restored with a medium from MS-MSCs, while LPS-induced EC apoptosis decreased. In addition, protective effects on the remodeling of intercellular junctions were observed when compared to LPS-treated endothelial cells.

The troponin I level was measured from each patient. Medical records of patients were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: A hundred and five patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized, or who died in the hospital due to COVID-19, were included in this study. There was a statistically significant difference between the troponin I high and low level groups in terms of age (years), BMI, shortness of breath (SB), oxygen saturation (%), hypertension, length of stay in the ICU; and for mortality, C-reactive protein, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimer, creatine kinase-MB, prothrombin time, calcium, and 25-hydroxy vitamin 25(OH)D3 (all p < 0.05).

The most significant feature of QX IBV is that its infection in the early growing stage can cause abnormal oviduct development, resulting in a high proportion of false layers in poultry flocks of laying hens and breeders. However, few studies have evaluated whether infections of QX-type IBV in laying stages can also cause severe pathological changes in the oviduct. METHODS: In this study, 300-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were infected either with the QX-type strain QXL or Massachusetts (Mass)-type strain M41 to compare their pathogenicity on different segments of the oviduct. RESULTS: Both the QXL and M41 strains successfully replicated in all segments of the oviduct; however, the QXL strain was more highly distributed in mucosal layer and caused severe lesions in the lamina propria, including interstitial dilation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and distinct expansion of tubular glands. Moreover, the QXL strain induced high expression of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules in the majority of segments in the oviduct. Further research found that the QXL strain may affected the formation of shell membranes and eggshells by inhibiting the expression of type I collagen and CaBP-D28k. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the QX-type IBV is more pathogenic than Mass-type IBV to oviduct in laying phase.

FCV was correlated with the number of family members (P-value 0.020), and obsessive-compulsive (P-value 0.006), interpersonal sensitivity (P-value 0.035), hostility (P-value 0.017), phobia (P-value 0.010), and psychoticism (P-value 0.034) symptoms. Moderate-to-high disease activity was associated with reduced psychological QoL. Patients with moderate-to-severe functional impairment had worse QoL in all domains (except social). Prolonged illness duration was associated with worse social QoL. CONCLUSIONS: QoL was adversely affected in patients with RA during the pandemic. There was a robust relationship between FCV and the emergence of psychological symptoms. RA-related clinical factors like illness duration, disease activity, and functional disability were associated with reduced QoL in those patients.","output":"Psychosocial and clinical impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its relationship to the quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a cross-sectional study, Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine if a specific intervention reduces the composite of progression of patients with COVID-19-related disease to organ failure or death as measured by time to incidence of any one of the following: death, invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, parallel arm, open-label, adaptive platform Phase 2/3 trial of potential disease modifying therapies in patients with late stage 1/stage 2 COVID-19-related disease, with a diagnosis based either on a positive assay or high suspicion of COVID-19 infection by clinical, laboratory and radiological assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 and over, with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of COVID-19-related disease (with/without a positive COVID-19 test) AND a risk count (as defined below) >3 OR &#8805;3 if risk count includes \\"Radiographic severity score >3\\". A risk count is calculated by the following features on admission (1 point for each): radiographic severity score >3, male gender, non-white ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, neutrophils >8.0 x109/L, age >40 years and CRP >40 mg/L. Patients should be considered an appropriate subject for intervention with immunomodulatory or other disease modifying agents in the opinion of the investigator and are able to swallow capsules or tablets. The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the Additional file 1 should be fulfilled. Drug specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will also be applied to the active arms. Patients will be enrolled prior to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, cardiac or renal support. Participants will be recruited across multiple centres in the UK including initially at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and St George's University NHS Foundation Trust. Other centres will be approached internationally in view of the evolving pandemic. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: There is increasing evidence of the role of immunomodulation in altering the course of COVID-19. Additionally, various groups have demonstrated the presence of pulmonary shunting in patients with COVID-19 as well as other cardiovascular complications. TACTIC-E will assess the efficacy of the novel immunomodulatory agent EDP1815 versus the approved cardio-pulmonary drugs, Dapagliflozin in combination with Ambrisentan versus the prevailing standard of care. EDP1815 will be given as 2 capsules twice daily (1.6 x 1011 cells) for up to 7 days with the option to extend up to 14 days at the discretion of the principal investigator or their delegate, if the patient is felt to be clinically responding to treatment, is tolerating treatment, and is judged to be likely to benefit from a longer treatment course. Ambrisentan 5mg and Dapagliflozin 10mg will be given in combination once daily orally for up to maximum of 14 days. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio across treatments. Each active arm will be compared with standard of care alone. Additional arms may be added as the trial progresses. No comparisons will be made between active arms in this platform trial. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the incidence (from baseline up to Day 14) to the occurrence of the any one of the following events: death, invasive mechanical ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomised using a central web-based randomisation service (Sealed Envelope) in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site to one of the treatment arms or standard of care. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. Data analysis will not be blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): There is no fixed sample size for this study. There will be an early biomarker-based futility analysis performed at a point during the study. If this biomarker futility analysis is not conclusive, then a second futility analysis based on clinical endpoints will be performed after approximately 125 patients have been recruited per arm. Provisionally, further analyses of clinical endpoints will be performed after 229 patients per active arm and later 469 patients per arm have been recruited.

DESIGN: We compared, in a cohort of confirmed COVID-19 older patients, three specifically developed scores with a previously established early warning score. Main endpoint was all causes in-hospital death. SETTING: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study, conducted in the Emergency Department (ED) of an urban teaching hospital, referral center for COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed the clinical records of the confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or more consecutively admitted to our ED over a 6-week period (March 1st to April 15th, 2020). A total of 210 patients, aged between 60 and 98 years were included in the study cohort.

RESULTS: Median age was 74 (67-82) and 133 (63.3%) were males. Globally, 42 patients (20.0%) deceased. All the score evaluated showed a fairly good predictive value with respect to in-hospital death. The ISARIC-4C score had the highest area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.799 (0.738-0.851), followed by the COVID-GRAM 0.785 (0.723-0.838), NEWS 0.764 (0.700-0.819), and qCSI 0.749 (0.685-0.806). However, these differences were not statistical significant. CONCLUSION: Among the evaluated scores, the ISARIC-4C and the COVID-GRAM, calculated at ED admission, had the best performance, although the qCSI had similar efficacy by evaluating only three items.

Identifying clonal groups allows for assessment of geographic spread, transmission events, and identification of more virulent or transmissible emerging strains. METHODS: All SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n=17,504) that are complete and high coverage were downloaded from GISAID on May 17(th) 2020. We developed a GNU-based Virus IDentification (GNUVID) tool that implements a whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) scheme composed of all ten ORFs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The 10,422 genomes that passed our quality check were fed to the GNUVID tool, which assigned a ST profile to each genome. Global optimum eBURST was then used to cluster the STs in clonal complexes (CCs). RESULTS: Our ST/CC analysis uncovered strong associations of ST/CCs with certain geographical regions but also dynamic local changes in ST/CC prevalence. We also identified several unexpected putative global transmission events (e.g., from the US to the Middle East and reintroduction to China later in the pandemic). We have made our tool (GNUVID) available so that new WG sequences can be rapidly assigned to an ST/CC (https://github.com/ahmedmagds/GNUVID). CONCLUSION: Our sequence typing system uncovered previously unappreciated transmission events and waves of expansion and replacement of SARS-CoV-2 STs and CCs in different geographical locations, suggesting complex dynamics in viral populations that previously seemed monomorphic. Because, our tool can be rapidly updated with new sequencing data it can track emerging clones and identifying new hotspots. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"464.

CRC screening remains underutilized, especially in underinsured populations. Screening has been heavily disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: The goal is to explore the impact of the pandemic on ethnic and gender disparities in CRC screening. METHODS: Patients were identified 1 year before and after COVID-19 precautions began, using March 1, 2020, as the inflection point. The primary inclusion criterion was an ordered colonoscopy. The outcome of interest was a colonoscopy performed. Differences by year and race were assessed using chi-square analysis. A cohort of 1549 patients (899 in pre-COVID; 650 in post-COVID) between age 45 and 75 for whom a colonoscopy was ordered was selected from EHR at a large institution. RESULTS: There was a 51% reduction in screening colonoscopies performed. White patients had a decrease of 49%, and African Americans had a 55% reduction. Stool testing increased from 47% prior to the pandemic to 94% during the pandemic representing a greater than 100% increase in stool testing uptake. CONCLUSION: The true impact of COVID-19 on colorectal cancer is yet to be uncovered as future mortality estimates from CRC are ongoing.

Methods We prospectively studied patients with appendicitis at a British district general hospital who were unsuitable for conservative management and consequently underwent open appendicectomy under SA. We also reviewed patient satisfaction after 30 days. This ran for 5 weeks from March 25th, 2020 until the surgical department reverted to the laparoscopic appendicectomy as the standard of care. Main outcomes were 30-day complication rates and patient satisfaction. Results None of the included seven patients were COVID positive. The majority (four-sevenths) had complicated appendicitis. There were no major adverse (Clavien-Dindo grade III to V) postoperative events. Two patients suffered minor postoperative complications. Two experienced intraoperative pain. Mean operative time was 44 minutes. Median length of stay and return to activity was 1 and 14 days, respectively. Although four stated preference in hindsight for GA, the majority (five-sevenths) were satisfied with the operative experience under SA.
