Whether or not reviews and original articles have a higher impact factor than case reports is a point for verification in this study. In addition, article topics that can be used for predicting citations have not been analyzed. Thus, this study aims to: (1).. provide a visualization dashboard for the 100 top-cited articles related to article types and (2).. inspect major medical subject headings (i.e., MeSH terms in PubMed) to help predict citations. METHODS: We searched PubMed Central and downloaded 100 top-cited abstracts in the journal Medicine (Baltimore) since 2011. Four article types and 7 topic categories (denoted by MeSH terms) were extracted from abstracts. Contributors to these 100 top-cited articles were analyzed. Social network analysis and Sankey diagram analysis were performed to identify influential article types and topic categories. MeSH terms were applied to predict the number of article citations. We then examined the prediction power with the correlation coefficients between MeSH weights and article citations. RESULTS: The citation counts for the 100 articles ranged from 24 to 127, with an average of 39.1 citations. The most frequent article types were journal articles (82%) and comparative studies (10%), and the most frequent topics were epidemiology (48%) and blood and immunology (36%). The most productive countries were the United States (24%) and China (23%). The most cited article (PDID = 27258521) with a count of 135 was written by Dr Shang from Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University (China) in 2016. MeSH terms were evident in the prediction power of the number of article citations (correlation coefficients = 0.49, t = 5.62). CONCLUSION: The breakthrough was made by developing dashboards showing the overall concept of the 100 top-cited articles using the Sankey diagram. MeSH terms can be used for predicting article citations. Analyzing the 100 top-cited articles could help future academic pursuits and applications in other academic disciplines.","output":"Predicting article citations using data of 100 top-cited publications in the journal Medicine since 2011: A bibliometric analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We aimed to explore the frequencies of nasal symptoms in patients with COVID-19, including loss of smell and taste, as well as their presentation as the first symptom of the disease and their association with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study, 1,206 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and followed-up by telephone call one month after discharged from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, symptoms, and numerical rating scale scores (0-10) of nasal symptoms were extracted from the hospital medical records, and confirmed or reevaluated by the telephone follow-up. Results: From COVID-19 patients (N = 1,172) completing follow-up, 199 (17%) subjects had severe COVID-19 and 342 (29.2%) reported nasal symptoms. The most common nasal symptom was loss of taste (20.6%, median score = 6), while 11.4% had loss of smell (median score = 5). The incidence of nasal symptom including loss of smell and loss of taste as the first onset symptom was <1% in COVID-19 patients. Loss of smell or taste scores showed no correlation with the scores of other nasal symptoms. Loss of taste scores, but not loss of smell scores, were significantly increased in severe vs. non-severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-6 and lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels positively correlated with loss of taste scores. About 80% of COVID-19 patients recovered from smell and taste dysfunction in 2 weeks. Conclusion: In the Wuhan COVID-19 cohort, only 1 out of 10 hospital admitted patients had loss of smell while 1 out 5 reported loss of taste which was associated to severity of COVID-19.

In patients with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, we compared 30\\\\day risk of all\\\\cause emergency department visit, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or death in statin users versus nonusers, adjusting for baseline differences in demographics, clinical comorbidities, and prior health care use, as well as propensity for statin use. Between January and June 2020, 2.4% of 226 142 tested individuals aged 18 to 65 years, 2.7% of 88 387 people aged 66 to 75 years, and 4.1% of 154 950 people older than 75 years had a positive reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction swab for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Compared with 353 878 nonusers, the 115 871 statin users were more likely to test positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 (3.6% versus 2.8%, P<0.001), but this difference was not significant after adjustment for baseline differences and propensity for statin use in each age stratum (adjusted odds ratio 1.00 [95% CI, 0.88C1.14], 1.00 [0.91C1.09], and 1.06 [0.82C1.38], respectively). In individuals younger than 75 years with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, statin users were more likely to visit an emergency department, be hospitalized, be admitted to the intensive care unit, or to die of any cause within 30 days of their positive swab result than nonusers, but none of these associations were significant after multivariable adjustment. In individuals older than 75 years with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, statin users were more likely to visit an emergency department (28.2% versus 17.9%, adjusted odds ratio 1.41 [1.23C1.61]) or be hospitalized (32.7% versus 21.9%, adjusted odds ratio 1.19 [1.05C1.36]), but were less likely to die (26.9% versus 31.3%, adjusted odds ratio 0.76 [0.67C0.86]) of any cause within 30 days of their positive swab result than nonusers.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of COVID-19 positive cancer patients treated consecutively in five North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included time interval between most recent anti-cancer treatment and admission, severe outcome [a composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ITU) admission, ventilation and/or death] and mortality. Outcomes were compared with consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (1 MarchC30 April 2020). Patients were matched for age, gender and comorbidity. RESULTS: The median age in both cohorts was 74 years, with 67% male, and comprised of 30 patients with cancer, and 90 without (1:3 ratio). For cohort B, 579 patients without a history of cancer and consecutively admitted were screened from the primary London hospital, 105 were COVID-19 positive and 90 were matched and included. Excluding cancer, both cohorts had a median of two comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality, comparing patients with cancer to those without, was 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4C2.5], and severe outcome (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.4C2.0) suggesting no increased risk of death or a severe outcome in patients with cancer. Cancer patients who received systemic treatment within 28 days had an OR for mortality of 4.05 (95% CI 0.68C23.95), p = 0.12. On presentation anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia were identified predominantly in cohort A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Blinded reviewers retrospectively analyzed 16-MDCT scans of 64 patients who had endoscopic findings of giant gastric folds. Thirty of these patients had histopathologic results showing scirrhous carcinoma; 15, large B-cell lymphoma; 14, acute gastric mucosal lesions; and five, Mntrier disease. Unenhanced transparent volume-rendered images were assessed to determine the morphologic features of the whole stomach. Contrast-enhanced images were used to analyze wall thickness, stratification, enhancement pattern, and perigastric conditions. We used the Cramer phi-prime correlation coefficient to calculate the overall diagnostic accuracy of MDCT in several gastric disorders. Scatterplot analysis was used for overall diagnostic score, and analysis of the receiver operator characteristic curves of the neighboring two diseases was used to locate the cutoff values for best diagnostic accuracy. We used exact logistic regression to identify which MDCT image features were most predictive of the presence of malignant gastric disease. RESULTS The gastric wall was found to be significantly thicker in large B-cell lymphoma than in other disorders (p < 0.001). The overall diagnostic accuracy of MDCT in the four diseases was 100%. Loss of wall stratification was deemed the best MDCT predictor of the presence of malignancy.

Post-death investigations tell us little about dying experiences of the dying. This paper reviewed the literature on dying in English prisons and highlights this clear gap in knowledge. Four types of dying will be discussed in this paper: (1) suicide, (2) dying in older age, (3) deaths post-release, and (4) COVID-19 deaths. The importance of providing good end-of-life care and palliative care in prison is acknowledged in the literature, but this only shows awareness of the needs of a particular part of the prison population. To understand the complexities and nuances of dying in prison, all voices need to be included in research, otherwise what is left post-death of a person who died in prison is a Fatal Incidence Report.

Further investigation of the contents and feasibility of an effective therapeutic assessment of martial arts is needed in older adults, mainly for future applications and real-world implementation. METHODS: Sixteen older adults (8 male, 8 female, age 59C90 years), with or without chronic conditions, participated in a preliminary study using 5-weeks of karate training and a triple baseline control procedure. Group and single subject data analyses were conducted for dynamic balance, Timed Up and Go (TUG), hand grip, ankle plantarflexion force, and spinal cord excitability (via the soleus H-reflex) pre- and post-training. RESULTS: On average, participants completed a total of 2437 steps, 1762 turns, 3585 stance changes, 2047 punches, 2757 blocks, and 1253 strikes. Karate training improved dynamic balance performance such that the group average time was reduced (time to target (?13.6%, p = 0.020) and time to center (?8.3%, p = 0.010)). TUG was unchanged when considering the entire group (p = 0.779), but six participants displayed significant changes. Left handgrip (7.9%, p = 0.037), and plantarflexion force in the right (28.8%, p = 0.045) and left leg (13.3%, p = 0.024) increased for the group. Spinal cord excitability remained unchanged in group data analysis but 5 individuals had modulated H(max)/M(max) ratios. CONCLUSION: 5-weeks of karate training delivered in a fashion to mimic generally accessible community-level programs improved balance and strength in older adults. Whole-body movement embodied in karate training enhanced neuromuscular function and postural control.

Thus, anxiolytic drugs of different types accelerate avoidance acquisition, anxiogenic drugs impair it, and avoidance during these initial acquisition stages is negatively associated with other typical measures of anxiety. In addition behavioural and developmental treatments that reduce or increase anxiety/stress respectively facilitate or impair TWAA acquisition.

Surveillance to halt COVID-19 has raised privacy concerns, as many governments are willing to overlook privacy implications to save lives. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a focused Systematic Literature Review (SLR), to explore the potential benefits and implications of using digital technologies such as AI, big data and cloud to track COVID-19 amongst people in different societies. The aim is to highlight the risks of security and privacy to personal data when using technology to track COVID-19 in societies and identify ways to govern these risks. The paper uses the SLR approach to examine 40 articles published during 2020, ultimately down selecting to the most relevant 24 studies. In this SLR approach we adopted the following steps; formulated the problem, searched the literature, gathered information from studies, evaluated the quality of studies, analysed and integrated the outcomes of studies while concluding by interpreting the evidence and presenting the results. Papers were classified into different categories such as technology use, impact on society and governance. The study highlighted the challenge for government to balance the need of what is good for public health versus individual privacy and freedoms. The findings revealed that although the use of technology help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, government surveillance to halt has sparked privacy concerns.

Four samples from each wave underwent next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis including controls and all sequences retrieved in Japan from GISAID and GenBank. Subsequently, mutations were examined. RESULTS: Viral load ranged 7.85  10(1)?1.42  10(8) copies/ml. Of 68 samples, one was Asian type-O, 65 were European type-GR, and 2 were undetectable. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that Japan was infected with various Asian strains (L, S, V, O) from January through April. By second week of March, European strains (G, GH, GR) had appeared, and GR strains became predominant after mid-March. The first case in Hiroshima was classified as Asian strain O, and the rest were GR strains. Then, second wave of GR strains appeared independently with 11C15 base mutations. Comparing the first- and second-wave GR strains, mutation rate was 1.17C1.36  10(?3) base substitutions per site per year; in addition, amino acid changes occurred at S1361P and P3371S in ORF1a, A314V in ORF1b, and P151L in N.

We propose a method for classifying peripheral lung cancer and focal pneumonia on chest CT images and undertake 5 window settings to study the effect on the artificial intelligence processing results. Methods: A retrospective collection of CT images from 357 patients with peripheral lung cancer having solitary solid nodule or focal pneumonia with a solitary consolidation was applied. We segmented and aligned the lung parenchyma based on some morphological methods and cropped this region of the lung parenchyma with the minimum 3D bounding box. Using these 3D cropped volumes of all cases, we designed a 3D neural network to classify them into 2 categories. We also compared the classification results of the 3 physicians with different experience levels on the same dataset. Results: We conducted experiments using 5 window settings.

The classification accuracy and AUC value were 90.48% and 0.957 for the junior physician, 94.96% and 0.989 for the intermediate physician, and 96.92% and 0.980 for the senior physician, respectively. After removing the error prediction, the accuracy improved significantly, reaching 98.79% in the self-defined window2. Conclusion: Using the proposed neural network, in separating peripheral lung cancer and focal pneumonia in chest CT data, we achieved an accuracy competitive to that of a junior physician. Through a data ablation study, the proposed 3D CNN can achieve a slightly higher accuracy compared with senior physicians in the same subset. The self-defined window2 was the best for data training and evaluation.","output":"Recognition of Peripheral Lung Cancer and Focal Pneumonia on Chest Computed Tomography Images Based on Convolutional Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maintaining oral function in older individuals with missing teeth is important for leading a healthy and independent life.

Prior research established that the use of mesh is superior to suture closure alone and that component separation is an effective technique to combat loss of abdominal domain. Studies comparing component separation technique (CST) outcomes utilizing synthetic versus biologic mesh are limited. A retrospective review was conducted of 72 consecutive patients who underwent VHR with CST between 2006 and 2010 at our institution. Surgeon preference and the presence of contamination guided whether synthetic mesh (27 patients) or biologic mesh (45 patients) was used. Mean follow-up interval for all comers was 13.9 months and similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Degree of contamination and severity of premorbid medical conditions were significantly higher in the biologic mesh group, as reflected in the higher Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) score (2.04 versus 2.86). Clinical outcomes, as measured by both minor and major complication rates and recurrence rates, were not significantly different. Minor complication rates were 26% in the synthetic group and 37% in the biologic group and major complication rates 15% in the synthetic group and 22% in the biologic group. There was 1 recurrence (4%) in the synthetic mesh group versus 5 (11%) in the biologic mesh group. Multivariable analysis for major complications revealed no significant difference for either synthetic or biologic mesh while controlling for other variables. Subset analysis of uncontaminated cases revealed recurrence rates of 4% in the synthetic mesh group and 6% in the biologic mesh group. VHR using CST and either synthetic mesh or biologic mesh resulted in low recurrence rates with similar overall complication profiles, despite the higher average VHWG grading score in the biologic mesh group. Our results support the VHWG recommendation for biologic mesh utilization in higher VHWG grade patients. In VHWG grade 2 patients, our clinical outcomes were similar, supporting the use of either type of mesh.","output":"Comparison of Synthetic and Biologic Mesh in Ventral Hernia Repair Using Components Separation Technique."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients is a constant challenge.

These differences reflect longstanding disparities in income, housing, air quality, preexisting health status, legal protections, and access to health care. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences have made these ancient disparities plainly visible. METHODOLOGY: As scholars in Catholic research universities committed to advancing both scientific knowledge and social justice, we examined these disparities through the lenses of both epidemiology and ethics. FINDINGS: We see these widening disparities as not only as threats to human health, societal stability, and planetary health, but also as moral wrongs - outward manifestations of unrecognized privilege and greed. They are the concrete consequences of policies that promote structural violence and institutionalize racism. RECOMMENDATIONS: We encourage governments to take the following three scientific and ethical justified actions to reduce disparities, prevent future pandemics, and advance the common good: (1) Invest in public health systems; (2) Reduce economic inequities by making health care affordable to all; providing education, including early education, to all children; strengthening environmental and occupational safeguards; and creating more just tax structures; and (3) Preserve our Common Home, the small blue planet on which we all live.","output":"COVID-19 and Health Disparities: Structural Evil Unmasked"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Objective and early identification of hospitalized patients, and particularly those with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), who may require mechanical ventilation (MV) may aid in delivering timely treatment. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a transparent deep learning (DL) model predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19 up to 24 hours in advance? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We trained and externally validated a transparent DL algorithm to predict the future need for MV in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19, using commonly available data in electronic health records. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, FiO2 and pH) were used to assess future need for MV. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. RESULTS: We obtained data from over 30,000 ICU patients (including over 700 patients with COVID-19) from two academic medical centers. The performance of the model with a 24-hour prediction horizon at the development and validation sites was comparable (AUC of 0.895 versus 0.882, respectively), providing significant improvement over traditional clinical criteria (p<0.001). Prospective validation of the algorithm among patients with COVID-19 yielded AUCs in the range 0.918-0.943.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), a class of FDA-approved drugs, have been shown to possess antiviral activities against multiple viruses, including Hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Here, we evaluated three SERM compounds, namely 4-hydroxytamoxifen, tamoxifen, and clomifene, for plausible antiviral properties against two medically important alphaviruses, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Sindbis virus (SINV). In cell culture settings, these SERMs displayed potent activity against CHIKV and SINV at non-toxic concentrations with EC50 values ranging between 400 nM and 3.9 M. Further studies indicated that these compounds inhibit a post-entry step of the alphavirus life cycle, while enzymatic assays involving purified recombinant proteins confirmed that these SERMs target the enzymatic activity of non-structural protein 1 (nsP1), the capping enzyme of alphaviruses. Finally, tamoxifen treatment restrained CHIKV growth in the infected mice and diminished musculoskeletal pathologies. Combining biochemical, cell culture-based studies, and in vivo analyses, we strongly argue that SERM compounds, or their derivatives, may provide for attractive therapeutic options against alphaviruses.","output":"Selective estrogen receptor modulators limit alphavirus infection by targeting the viral capping enzyme nsP1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is strongly indicated because diversifying selection may lead to the emergence of novel variants resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity.

RP is often implemented as libraries for existing programming languages, lifting operations over values to operations over streams of values, and providing efficient solutions to manage how updates to such streams trigger reactions, i.e., the execution of dependent tasks. SC is often implemented as a standalone formalism to specify existing component-based architectures, used to analyse, verify, transform, or generate code. These two approaches target different audiences, and it is non-trivial to combine the programming style of RP with the expressive power of synchronous languages. This paper proposes a lightweight programming language to describe component-based Architectures for Reactive systems, dubbed ARx, which blends concepts from RP and SC, mainly inspired to the Reo coordination language and its composition operation, and with tailored constructs for reactive programs such as the ones found in ReScala. ARx is enriched with a type system and with algebraic data types, and has a reactive semantics inspired in RP. We provide typical examples from both the RP and SC literature, illustrate how these can be captured by the proposed language, and describe a web-based prototype tool to edit, parse, and type check programs, and to animate their semantics.","output":"ARx: Reactive Programming for Synchronous Connectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article we summarize our personal non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) highlights of the virtual ASCO 2020 meeting, covering developments in early and advanced-stage NSCLC.

In advanced-stage disease, of course immunotherapy (IO) was at the center of attention. Final analysis of KEYNOTE-189 (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone) and 3?year update of CheckMate 227 (nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus standard chemotherapy) proved the long-term overall survival benefit of IO combinations in the first-line setting independent of PD-L1 status. The innovative CheckMate 9LA study demonstrated rapid disease control with limited-course chemotherapy plus IO doublet, while sparing chemotoxicity and may soon become a new clinical treatment choice. Moreover, the phase II CITYSCAPE trial presented significant response rates of the TIGIT-inhibitor tiragolumab plus atezolizumab in PD-L1 positive NSCLC. For HER2-mutated patients a highly effective drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan was presented in a phase II study, extending targeted agents in genetically driven NSCLC.

However, the brittleness of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in the clinic. Most systems produce point estimates without further information about model uncertainty or confidence. This paper introduces a new Bayesian deep learning framework for uncertainty quantification in segmentation neural networks, specifically encoder-decoder architectures. The proposed framework uses the first-order Taylor series approximation to propagate and learn the first two moments (mean and covariance) of the distribution of the model parameters given the training data by maximizing the evidence lower bound. The output consists of two maps: the segmented image and the uncertainty map of the segmentation. The uncertainty in the segmentation decisions is captured by the covariance matrix of the predictive distribution. We evaluate the proposed framework on medical image segmentation data from Magnetic Resonances Imaging and Computed Tomography scans. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework is more robust to noise and adversarial attacks as compared to state-of-the-art segmentation models. Moreover, the uncertainty map of the proposed framework associates low confidence (or equivalently high uncertainty) to patches in the test input images that are corrupted with noise, artifacts or adversarial attacks. Thus, the model can self-assess its segmentation decisions when it makes an erroneous prediction or misses part of the segmentation structures, e.g., tumor, by presenting higher values in the uncertainty map.","output":"Trustworthy Medical Segmentation with Uncertainty Estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreak of COVID-19, created a disastrous situation in more than 200 countries around the world.

This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in increasing or reducing the spreading of the infection in indoor environments. METHODS: We modelled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the Bambino Ges Vatican State Childrens Hospital. Both waiting and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index () parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patients mouth was also assessed. RESULTS: Our CFD-based simulations of the waiting room show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhances infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 seconds from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. At the same time also their number is reduced due to removal through the HVAC system or deposition on the surfaces. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patients mouth in the first 0.5 seconds following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the  index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion.

Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention. Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: (1) venous thromboembolism (VTE), (2) chronic venous disease, (3) vascular anomalies, (4) venous trauma, (5) venous compression and (6) lymphatic disease. Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage.

Results: Compared with 2-doses of BNT162b2 without a booster, the booster strategy in a 100,000 cohort of older adults would incur an additional cost of $3.4 million in vaccination cost, but save $6.7 million in direct medical cost and gain 3.7 QALYs in 180 days. This corresponds to a benefit-cost ratio of 1.95 and a net monetary benefit of $3.4 million. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that a booster strategy has a high chance (67%) of being cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) value to predict active CD and compare apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) with endoscopic and conventional indices of magnetic resonance imaging of CD activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 229 patients with suspected and diagnosed CD prospectively underwent magnetic resonance enterocolonography (MR-EC) with DWI sequence and ileocolonoscopy. The magnetic resonance activity index (MaRIA), Clermont index, and CD endoscopic index of severity (CDEIS) were calculated. RESULTS: The clinical diagnosis of CD was confirmed in 100 out of 229 patients. A DWI score of 2 or higher had 96.9% sensitivity and 82.3% specificity for diagnosing CD. A threshold ADC value of 1.3  10-3 mm2/s could distinguish between normal and inflamed bowel segments with a sensitivity of 73.8% and a specificity of 98%. For the MaRIA, a threshold ADC value of 1.32  10-3 mm2/s with a sensitivity of 97.9% and a specificity of 97.8% was established. There were significant differences in the DWI scores and ADC values comparing patients with inactive, mild, and moderate-to-severe disease (P <0.01). ADCs inversely correlated with the MaRIAglobal (r = -0.69; P = 0.001), Clermontglobal (r = -0.722; P = 0.001), and CDEIS (r = -0.69; P = 0.001).

These abrupt life changes may have led to psychosocial problems in college students. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with psychosocial problems in South Korean nursing and non-nursing students. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted with 139 nursing and 147 non-nursing students (N = 286) between August 6 and October 30, 2020. We investigated participants general characteristics (that is, sociodemographic and health-promoting behaviors), sensitivity to COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 pandemic response indicators, and psychosocial problems. The factors associated with psychosocial problems were determined using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the COVID-19 pandemic response indicators, perceived health status during the COVID-19 pandemic was verified as a factor associated with psychosocial problems in nursing ( = ? 5.831, p < .001) and non-nursing students ( = ? 8.513, p < .001). Perceived stress ( = 1.263, p = .045), trust in policy ( = .892, p < .001), and religion ( = ? 1.424, p = .004) were verified as correlates of psychosocial problems in non-nursing students. CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the stakeholders can use our study results to identify students experiencing psychosocial problems and subsequently as a theoretical background for developing intervention programs for those at a high risk of psychosocial problems.

Yet, few studies have examined risk factors unique to adult development. The present study examined how changes in life roles (educational, marital, and parental status) predicted disordered eating as participants transitioned from their 20s to their 50s. Participants (N = 624 women and N = 276 men) completed baseline assessments in college and at 10-, 20-, and 30-year follow-up, with 72% of women and 67% of men completing 30-year follow-up. Multilevel models examined how changes in life roles predicted changes in disordered eating. For women, obtaining a graduate degree predicted decreased eating pathology initially but over time predicted subsequent increases in Drive for Thinness. Men's eating pathology was not affected by obtaining a graduate degree. Changes in marital status demonstrated no significant association with disordered eating for either gender. Becoming a parent predicted a significant decrease in Drive for Thinness at the subsequent assessment but no further declines with age, whereas those who never had children showed significant decreases in both Drive for Thinness and Bulimia with age. For both women and men, becoming a parent may decrease the importance of shape and weight as sources of self-evaluation.

Current treatments differentiate severe acute malnutrition (SAM) from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with different products and programs. This differentiation is complex and costly. The Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) assessed the effectiveness of a simplified, unified SAM/MAM protocol for children aged 6C59 months. Eliminating the need for separate products and protocols could improve the impact of programs by treating children more easily and cost-effectively, reaching more children globally. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial compared a combined protocol against standard care in Kenya and South Sudan. Randomization was stratified by country. Combined protocol clinics treated children using 2 sachets of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) per day for those with mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 11.5 cm and/or edema, and 1 sachet of RUTF per day for those with MUAC 11.5 to <12.5 cm. Standard care clinics treated SAM with weight-based RUTF rations, and MAM with ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF). The primary outcome was nutritional recovery. Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, coverage, defaulting, death, length of stay, and average daily weight and MUAC gains. Main analyses were per-protocol, with intention-to-treat analyses also conducted. The non-inferiority margin was 10%. From 8 May 2017 to 31 March 2018, 2,071 children were enrolled in 12 combined protocol clinics (mean age 17.4 months, 41% male), and 2,039 in 12 standard care clinics (mean age 16.7 months, 41% male). In total, 1,286 (62.1%) and 1,202 (59.0%), respectively, completed treatment; 981 (76.3%) on the combined protocol and 884 (73.5%) on the standard protocol recovered, yielding a risk difference of 0.03 (95% CI ?0.05 to 0.10, p = 0.52; per-protocol analysis, adjusted for country, age, and sex). The amount of ready-to-use food (RUTF or RUSF) required for a child with SAM to reach full recovery was less in the combined protocol (122 versus 193 sachets), and the combined protocol cost US$123 less per child recovered (US$918 versus US$1,041). There were 23 (1.8%) deaths in the combined protocol arm and 21 (1.8%) deaths in the standard protocol arm (adjusted risk difference 95% CI ?0.01 to 0.01, p = 0.87). There was no evidence of a difference between the protocols for any of the other secondary outcomes. Study limitations included contextual factors leading to defaulting, a combined multi-country power estimate, and operational constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment for SAM and MAM is non-inferior to standard care. Further research should focus on operational implications, cost-effectiveness, and context (Asia versus Africa; emergency versus food-secure settings). This trial is complete and registered at ISRCTN (ISRCTN30393230).

We aimed to report the short-term follow-up of 345 patients evaluated remotely and to compare it with a cohort of patients evaluated in-person during the same period in 2019. Results During a mean follow-up of 5411 days, a significantly higher proportion of patients evaluated in-person in 2019 visited the emergency department or died for any cause (39/391, 10% versus 13/345 3.7%, p=0.001) and visited the emergency department for cardiovascular causes (19/391, 4.9% versus 7/345, 2.0%, p=0.04) compared to 2020. No cardiovascular death was recorded in the two periods. To an evaluation with a satisfaction questionnaire 49% of patients would like to continue using remote controls in addition to traditional ones.

There is thus a need to design long-term reliable BCIs that can be used outside-of-the-lab by end-users, e.g., severely motor-impaired ones. Therefore, we propose and evaluate the design of a multi-class Mental Task (MT)-based BCI for longitudinal training (20 sessions over 3 months) of a tetraplegic user for the CYBATHLON BCI series 2019. In this BCI championship, tetraplegic pilots are mentally driving a virtual car in a racing video game. We aimed at combining a progressive user MT-BCI training with a newly designed machine learning pipeline based on adaptive Riemannian classifiers shown to be promising for real-life applications. We followed a two step training process: the first 11 sessions served to train the user to control a 2-class MT-BCI by performing either two cognitive tasks (REST and MENTAL SUBTRACTION) or two motor-imagery tasks (LEFT-HAND and RIGHT-HAND). The second training step (9 remaining sessions) applied an adaptive, session-independent Riemannian classifier that combined all 4 MT classes used before. Moreover, as our Riemannian classifier was incrementally updated in an unsupervised way it would capture both within and between-session non-stationarity. Experimental evidences confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Namely, the classification accuracy improved by about 30% at the end of the training compared to initial sessions. We also studied the neural correlates of this performance improvement. Using a newly proposed BCI user learning metric, we could show our user learned to improve his BCI control by producing EEG signals matching increasingly more the BCI classifier training data distribution, rather than by improving his EEG class discrimination. However, the resulting improvement was effective only on synchronous (cue-based) BCI and it did not translate into improved CYBATHLON BCI game performances. For the sake of overcoming this in the future, we unveil possible reasons for these limited gaming performances and identify a number of promising future research directions. Importantly, we also report on the evolution of the user's neurophysiological patterns and user experience throughout the BCI training and competition.","output":"Long-Term BCI Training of a Tetraplegic User: Adaptive Riemannian Classifiers and User Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause respiratory infections, especially in children. Currently, the knowledge on early childhood seasonal coronavirus infections and the duration of antibody levels following the first infections is limited. Here we analyzed serological follow-up samples to estimate the rate of primary infection and reinfection(s) caused by seasonal coronaviruses in early childhood. Serum specimens were collected from 140 children at ages of 13, 24, and 36 months (1, 2, and 3 years), and IgG antibody levels against recombinant HCoV nucleoproteins (N) were measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Altogether, 84% (118/140) of the children were seropositive for at least one seasonal coronavirus N by the age of 3 years. Cumulative seroprevalences for HCoVs 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 increased by age, and they were 45%, 27%, 70%, and 44%, respectively, at the age of 3 years. Increased antibody levels between yearly samples indicated reinfections by 229E, NL63, and OC43 viruses in 20-48% of previously seropositive children by the age of 3 years. Antibody levels declined 54-73% or 31-77% during the year after seropositivity in children initially seropositive at 1 or 2 years of age, respectively, in case there was no reinfection. The correlation of 229E and NL63, and OC43 and HKU1 EIA results, suggested potential cross-reactivity between the N specific antibodies inside the coronavirus genera. The data shows that seasonal coronavirus infections and reinfections are common in early childhood and the antibody levels decline relatively rapidly. IMPORTANCE The rapid spread of COVID-19 requires better knowledge on the rate of coronavirus infections and coronavirus specific antibody responses in different population groups. In this work we analyzed changes in seasonal human coronavirus specific antibodies in young children participating in a prospective 3-year serological follow-up study. We show that based on seropositivity and changes in serum coronavirus antibody levels, coronavirus infections and reinfections are common in early childhood and the antibodies elicited by the infection decline relatively rapidly.

It demonstrated the need for social commitment and pro-social behaviors if societies are to respond successfully. The purpose of this article is to evaluate psychological and sociodemographic characteristics associated with compliance or noncompliance of individuals with these practices in two different phases of the pandemic experience in Brazil: in the first month and after three months. Participants for the first phase of the study were recruited through advertisements in the media and social networks. 1,914 individuals aged between 14 and 81 years agreed to participate, 78.2% of these were women, from 25 Federative Units in Brazil. In the second phase, 761 individuals who participated in the first phase, were reassessed. The authors used the following instruments for data collection: a standardized questionnaire collecting information of sociodemographic characteristics and dynamics of social isolation;the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale;the Life Satisfaction Scale;the Positive and Negative Affections Scale;and the Reduced Personality Markers and Stress Mindset Scale. All instruments used presented evidence of validity and adequate reliability indexes. The comparison of categorical exploratory variables with motives for following social isolation protocols was performed using Pearson's Chi-square, and the comparison of continuous exploratory variables was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Covariance Analysis was performed using as covariates those that showed significance/effect on isolation in previous analyses. The results showed that respondents practicing social isolation to comply with governmental recommendations had lower scores on the scales of neuroticism and conscientiousness. They reported also less stress, anxiety, and depression, and less general distress. Overall, these respondents also displayed more positive affect, and tended to reframe stress in a more positive way than others. These preliminary results describe the psychological characteristics of individuals and their associations with social behaviors in a period of collective stress and high social risk.","output":"Practicing Social Isolation During a Pandemic in Brazil: A Description of Psychosocial Characteristics and Traits of Personality During COVID-19 Lockout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the clinical correlates, prognosis and determinants of AKI in patients with Covid-19 remain largely unclear, we perform a retrospective study to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of AKI in severe and critically ill patients with Covid-19.

Beyond that, modulation of SCTR-mediated signaling has therapeutic potential for the treatment of multiple diseases, such as heart failure, obesity, and diabetes. However, no ligands other than secretin and its peptide analogs have been described to regulate SCTRs, probably due to inherent challenges in family B GPCR drug discovery.

This combination of methods enabled the discovery of five promising scaffolds, four of which have been validated and further characterized with respect to their allosteric activities. We propose that our results may serve as starting points for developing the first in vivo active small molecules targeting SCTRs.","output":"Development of a Testing Funnel for Identification of Small-Molecule Modulators Targeting Secretin Receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) it is important to understand if breast milk may be a vehicle of infe","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in Human Breast Milk and Neonatal Outcome: A Collaborative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the causative agent of which is a new type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, has caused the most severe pandemic in the last 100 years.

Our aim was to assess patient reluctance to transition to self-administered augmentation of alpha-1-antitrypsin, during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A phone questionnaire was administered to 22 patients with severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency who were currently receiving AAT augmentation therapy. Inclusion criteria included patients [Formula: see text] 18 years old, diagnosed with AATD, and receiving intravenous AAT protein augmentation therapy. Information was gathered regarding demographics, perspectives on transitioning to self-administered treatment, and anxiety and depression prevalence. Results were collected anonymously using REDCap. Joint and marginal statistical analysis was done to quantify links between participants willingness to transition to self-infusion and correlations with sex, age, years of therapy, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: Of 22 patients, 14 were male and eight were female. Ages ranged from 36 to 79 years, with an average of 62.5. Genotypes were ZZ (14), MZ (3), and SZ (2) among others. Average length of intravenous augmentation was 9.5 years. The majority, 16 participants, were aware self-infusion was an option. Eight participants were willing to consider transitioning to self-infusion if trained and educated. Eight patients reported that fear of COVID-19 transmission influenced their decision-making. Above-normal anxiety, and depression scores, were found in four, and six patients, respectively. Neither sex, age, years of treatment, anxiety, or depression were found to be associated with willingness to consider self-infusion therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are many reasons AATD patients may benefit from AAT self-infusion, including decreased exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the majority preferred home nurse-infused therapy.

Moreover, the diversity of pandemic-related problems itself creates a rich ground for making novel scientific discoveries. This could provide grounds for establishing fresh dimensions in crowd dynamics research. These potential new dimensions extend to all areas of this field including numerical and experimental investigations, crowd psychology and applications of computer vision and artificial intelligence methods in crowd management.

Despite that the concept has been in use in a variety of contexts for decades, a substantial number of scientific papers apply it with seemingly little consistency. In this study, we therefore report a concept analysis of family care management within a chronic-conditions context from the nursing perspective. METHODS: A review of recent nursing and health-related literature covering the years 2000-2020 was performed on the concepts of family care, family nursing, family management, and care management. Nineteen studies were extracted for this analysis. Utilizing the Walker and Avant concept-analysis strategy, we defined attributes and analyzed the antecedents and their consequences. RESULTS: The concept is defined from the perspective of health professionals. Five key attributes of family care management were identified: supervising situations, providing guidance, creating partnerships, a philosophical foundation, and a management style. Antecedents to the conductance of family care management included chronic health status, demographic and socioeconomic factors, and shortage of resources. The outcome of family care management was then described with respect to both positive and negative aspects. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Family care management is a highly abstract concept. We described two sub-concepts in need of clarification, including dynamic management behavior and a static management frame. Without a clear understanding of family care management, the concept is at risk of being relegated to a vague colloquial expression. Developing a theory of family care management might position the concept in a theoretical context, and could provide health providers with a point of reference for meaningful family care management strategies within their practices.","output":"Beyond Colloquial Use: A Concept Analysis of Family Care Management in A Chronic-Conditions Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to worldwide, which has attracted many people's concerns about the patients.

A total of 54 cases of SARS-Cov-2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between 7 January and 11 February 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method. From 7 January to 11 February 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%). Among the 54 patients with COVID-19, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non-severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs 38 years; P = .0015). However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups. Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS-Cov-2 infected lungs with severe-/critical-type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs 0%; P = .028) and right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P = .012).

This study reports the experience of the four Hubs for Vascular Surgery in Lombardy and provides a comparison of in hospital mortality and major adverse events (MAEs) according to COVID-19 testing. Methods Data from all patients who were referred to the Vascular Surgery Department of Hubs from 9 March to 28 April 2020 were collected prospectively and analysed. A positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction swab test, or symptoms (fever > 37.5C, upper respiratory tract symptoms, chest pain, and contact/travel history) associated with interstitial pneumonia on chest computed tomography scan were considered diagnostic of COVID-19 disease. Patient characteristics, operative variables, and in hospital outcomes were compared according to COVID-19 testing. A multivariable model was used to identify independent predictors of in hospital death and MAEs. Results Among 305 included patients, 64 (21%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID group) and 241 (79%) did not (non-COVID group). COVID patients presented more frequently with acute limb ischaemia than non-COVID patients (64% vs. 23%; p < .001) and had a significantly higher in hospital mortality (25% vs. 6%; p < .001). Clinical success, MAEs, re-interventions, and pulmonary and renal complications were significantly worse in COVID patients. Independent risk factors for in hospital death were COVID (OR 4.1), medical treatment (OR 7.2), and emergency setting (OR 13.6).

Various molecular species of GSLs have been identified in mammalian cells due to differences in the structures of oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharide structure can vary depending on cell lineage, differentiation stage, and pathology; this property can be used as a cell identification marker. Furthermore, GSLs are involved in various aspects of the immune response, such as cytokine production, immune signaling, migration of immune cells, and antibody production. GSLs containing certain structures exhibit strong immunogenicity in immunized animals and promote the production of anti-GSL antibodies. By exploiting this property, it is possible to generate antibodies that recognize the fine oligosaccharide structure of specific GSLs or glycoproteins. In our study using artificially synthesized GSLs (artGSLs), we found that several structural features are correlated with the antibody-inducing activity of GSLs. Based on these findings, we designed artGSLs that efficiently induce the production of antibodies accompanied by class switching and developed several antibodies that recognize not only certain glycan structures of GSLs but also those of glycoproteins.

Subsequently, the complete genomes of cell-cultured PDCoV HNZK-02 passage 5 and 15 were sequenced and analyzed. There was a continuous 3-nucleotide deletion and 7 amino acid changes in S genes when compared with the other reported PDCoVs. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptome analysis was used to quantitatively identify differentially expressed genes after PDCoV infection in ST cells. In total, 523 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 62 upregulated genes and 457 downregulated genes.

However, diagnostic testing shortages are common in emerging diseases, low resource settings, and during outbreaks. This forces difficult decisions regarding who receives a test, often without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions. METHODS: Using early SARS-CoV-2 as an example, we used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive. To consider the implications of gains in daily case detection at the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized model of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found that applying this CPR (AUC: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68 - 0.70)) to prioritize testing increased the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e., \\"flattens the curve\\"), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent community mitigation efforts), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden.

The objectives of this study were to compare the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or influenza B. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 2,129 adult patients with influenza-like illnesses who visited the emergency rooms of seven university hospitals in Korea from October 2011 to May 2012. Of 850 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 656 (77.2%) had influenza A (H3N2), and 194 (22.8%) influenza B. Age, and the frequencies of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, hypertension were significantly higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P<0.05). The frequencies of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia in patients with influenza B at initial presentation were statistically higher than those in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P<0.05). The rate of hospitalization, and length of hospital stay were statistically higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P<0.05), and of the 79 hospitalized patients, the frequency of diabetes, hypertension, cases having at least one of the comorbid conditions, and the proportion of elderly were significantly higher in patients with influenza A (H3N2) (P<0.05).

The aim of this study is to assess the value of telephone-based virtual visits in interventional radiology (IR) during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine their utility relative to in-person visits. Materials and Methods: In this study, we surveyed interventional radiologists and advanced practice providers (APPs) on their experience with telephone-based virtual follow-up visits in the first month of the pandemic. An internally validated survey was administered to participants assessing the following: appropriateness of visits, types of visits conducted and how virtual visits compare to traditional in-person visits. We also assessed efficiency, patient access, perceived patient experience, and provider experience using a 10-point Likert-scale (10 = best possible experience). Results: The study enrolled 10 providers who saw 97 patients for follow-up visits. 70% of providers had visits for drain assessments, 30% for interventional oncology, 20% for venous interventions, and 10% for TIPS. 66.7% of surveyed providers indicated that drain follow-up visits were best suited for telephone visits. 33.3% indicated that TIPS follow-up visits were suited for telephone visits, while 22.2% indicated that it was the case for interventional oncology and venous intervention follow-up visits. 60% of respondents stated that telephone-based visits were as helpful as in-person visits, and 90% found that they increased their clinic efficiency. 60% of providers stated that telephone-based visits improved patient access to the clinic by allowing access to appointments during the pandemic, quicker time to appointment scheduling, and shorter patient waiting room wait times. 100% of providers agreed that visits somewhat or greatly improved patients care experiences, and they rated their visit experience at an average of 7  1.37 on a 10-point Likert scale. 40% of providers indicated that they might prefer the option of telephone-based follow-up visits in the future, and 50% of providers indicated they definitely would. Conclusions: Telephone-based virtual visits in IR improve patient access to care when in-person visits are restricted due to COVID-19. Many providers found these visits equally as helpful as in-person visits and expressed interest in implementing them in the future. Telephone-based virtual visits in IR contribute to a novel paradigm of care during the COVID-19 crisis and may help formulate a new standard of care after the pandemic.","output":"Abstract No. 480 Telephone-based virtual visits in interventional radiology during the COVID-19 pandemic: feasibility and opportunities for increasing access to care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has affected the water sector in many ways, shifting industry expectations, priorities, workflows, and more.

Dynamic beta-cell function was assessed by intravenous glucose challenge, and basal beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) were determined using the homeostatic model. RESULTS Twelve LAGB participants and two MDC participants were in diabetes remission at 2 years. HOMA-S and the C-peptide response to intravenous glucose increased significantly in LAGB but not in MDC participants. The insulin response to glucose did not change in LAGB participants, whereas their fasting C-peptide/insulin ratio increased. Baseline measures of beta-cell function correlated with diabetes remission but not with reduction in HbA1c following LAGB. CONCLUSIONS In overweight people with diabetes, LAGB improves endogenous beta-cell function after 2 years.

Objective: We used a quantitative proteome approach to test the hypothesis that alterations in HDL proteome associate with severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Based on clinical criteria, subjects (n=41) diagnosed with COVID-19 were divided into two groups: a group of subjects presenting mild symptoms and a second group displaying severe symptoms and requiring hospitalization. Using a proteomic approach, we quantified the levels of 29 proteins in HDL particles derived from these subjects. Results: We showed that the levels of serum amyloid A 1 and 2 (SAA1 and SAA2, respectively), pulmonary surfactant-associated protein B (SFTPB), apolipoprotein F (APOF), and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4) were increased by more than 50% in hospitalized patients, independently of sex, HDL-C or triglycerides when comparing with subjects presenting only mild symptoms. Altered HDL proteins were able to classify COVID-19 subjects according to the severity of the disease (error rate 4.9%). Moreover, apolipoprotein M (APOM) in HDL was inversely associated with odds of death due to COVID-19 complications (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD increase in APOM was 0.27, with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.07 to 0.72, P=0.007).

What are the linguistic and geographical disparities of public awareness in the Covid-19 outbreak period reflected on social media? Can the changing pandemic awareness predict the Covid-19 outbreak? We established a Twitter data mining framework calculating the Ratio index to quantify and track the awareness. The lag correlations between awareness and health impacts were examined at global and country levels. Results show that users presenting the highest Covid-19 awareness were mainly those tweeting in the official languages of India and Bangladesh. Asian countries showed more significant disparities in awareness than European countries, and awareness in the eastern part of Europe was higher than in central Europe. Finally, the Ratio index could accurately predict global mortality rate, global case fatality ratio, and country-level mortality rate, with 21-30, 35-42, and 17 leading days, respectively.

COVID\\\\19\\\\induced ITP was diagnosed after excluding possible common causes. Bleeding severity was assessed based on the modified World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding severity score. RESULTS: We identified 11 (0.34%) patients with COVID\\\\19\\\\induced ITP. Of all patients, 63.6% were males and the median age was 63 years. The median time from COVID\\\\19 diagnosis to the onset of ITP was 10 days. Bleeding observed in 63.6% of the patients. Clinically significant bleeding (WHO Grade 3) occurred in single patient who required blood transfusion. Standard treatment with glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was effective in achieving excellent response in most cases.

As the disease contains a significant amount of uncertainty, a fundamental SEIRD model with minimal assumptions is employed. Further, a basic method is proposed to obtain time-dependent estimations of the parameters of the SEIRD model by using historical data. From our proposed model and with the predictive analysis, it is expected that the infection may go rise in the month of May-2021 and the mortality rate could go as high as 1.8%.

Recent studies suggest that coagulopa-thy is one of the complications of COVID-19 that increases the mortality rate regardless of the severity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the association between systemic anticoagulant use and mortality in COVID-19 patients with various clinical condi-tions. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search from several databases. The anticoagu-lant used in this study comprises of systemic anticoagulants such as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or others. The primary out-come was all-cause mortality related to anticoagulant use in COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis was performed to see the significance of anticoagulants in decreasing the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Results: 7064 patients were analyzed from 7 studies. The meta-analysis showed that systemic anticoagulant use was related with lower mortality rate (RR 0.70 [0.51, 0.97], p&lt;0.03;I2: 87%, p&lt;0.00001). The systematic review reported that 4 of 7 studies favor decreasing the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients administered with systemic anticoagulants. Conclusion: Systemic use of anticoagulants was associated with a lower mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Further studies are needed for better causation explanation.

For equally spaced time intervals, the discrete-time lag-1 vector autoregressive (VAR(1)) model and the continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model are equivalent. It is expected that by taking into account the unequal spacings of the time intervals in real data between observations will lead to an advantage for the OU in terms of predictive accuracy. In this paper, this is claim is being investigated by comparing the predictive accuracy of the OU model to that of the VAR(1) model on typical ESM data obtained in the context of affect research. It is shown that the VAR(1) model outperforms the OU model for the majority of the time series, even though time intervals in the data are unequally spaced. Accounting for measurement error does not change the result. Deleting large abrupt changes on short time intervals (that may be caused by externally driven events) does however lead to a significant improvement for the OU model.

The current study isolated 33 strains belonging to 2 groups, outbreak and sporadic strains, in 13 cities of Shandong province, China from 2013 to 2019. Comparison of genetic characterization among 15 outbreak strains and 18 sporadic strains was performed by analyzing nucleotide sequences of the C-terminal region of N protein gene (N-450). RESULTS All 33 stains belonged to genotype H1. The outbreak strains and sporadic strains distributed crossly in phylogenetic tree. Sequences alignment revealed some interesting G to A transversion which changed the amino acids on genomic sites 1317, 1422, and 1543. The nucleotide and amino acid similarities among outbreak isolates were 98-100% (0-10 nucleotide variations) and 97.7-100%, respectively; They were 97.3-100% and 96.6-100%, respectively for sporadic isolates. Evolutionary genetics analysis revealed that the mean evolution rates of outbreak and sporadic isolates were 1.26 N 10- 3 and 1.48 N 10- 3 substitutions per site per year separately, which were similar with corresponding data before 2012. Local transmission analysis suggested that there were three transmission chains in this study, two of them originated from Japan. Outbreak cases and sporadic cases emerged alternatively and were reciprocal causation on the transmission chains.

Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF + prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF + PF + PPC. The studys primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The studys primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF + PF + PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics. DISCUSSION: Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care.

Reports show that patients with diabetes and COVID-19 are at an increased risk for developing severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. Here we explore potential mechanistic links that could explain the observed higher morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Patients with T2DM have an underlying increased level of inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance in addition to other comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and being older. We review evidence that T2DM with hyperglycemia are among factors that lead to elevated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lungs and other tissues; ACE2 is the cellular \\"receptor\\" and port of viral entry. The preexisting chronic inflammation with augmented inflammatory response to the infection and the increasing viral load leads to extreme systemic immune response (\\"cytokine storm\\") that is strongly associated with increased severity of COVID-19.

Many Muslims find it hard to leave their custom of worship together at the mosque. Many of them are still praying together in the mosque. This phenomenon is the object of the study. The results show that the pattern of worship activities carried out by Muslims amid COVID-19 pandemic has changed. At the surface level, it appears that mosques tend to be empty and closed.

As of 7 January 2021, 87,640,402 confirmed cases and 1,891,692 mortalities have been reported worldwide. Studies focusing on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have suggested a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphopenia and cytokine storm in these patients. The exaggerated immune response induced by the cytokine storm causes septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and/or multiple organs failure, which increases the fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we review the recent research progress on epidemiology, clinical features, and system pathology in COVID-19. Moreover, we summarized the recent therapeutic strategies, which are either approved, under clinical trial, and/or under investigation by the local or global health authorities.

In contrast, the impact on research has been variable. To classify the pandemic-related effect on research, the development of the number of scientific publications of the German ORL university hospitals before and during the pandemic was analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS The publication performance between 2015 and 2020 of the 39 current chairmen was surveyed using a literature search (Pubmed). All entries relating to the chairmen of the university hospital as first, last or co-author were included. The absolute and relative development of each author's publication performance was determined and evaluated using nonparametric statistical methods. RESULTS A total of 2420 publications could be documented. From 2015 to 2019, an average of 368 publications were published per year. In 2020, this number increased by 57.9 % to 581 publications. While the number of monthly publications remained constant between 2015 and 2019, a significant increase was seen from May 2020 up to a maximum of 74 publications in September 2020. In 2020, 34 articles (5.9 %) had a thematic relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with 7 of these papers (20.6 %) resulting from cross-site publications. CONCLUSION In 2020, the number of scientific publications was raised to more than 1.5 times the usual annual publications. This increase was clearly related in time to the reduction of elective patient care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic starting in mid-March 2020. Probably, free time capacities enabled this increased publication output. Our results confirm the great scientific potential of the ORL university hospitals, which has been successfully implemented despite the pandemic.","output":"[Development of the publication activity at the German university hospitals for Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic in 2020]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome with increased morbidity and mortality due to multiorgan involvement. COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), ranging from asymptomatic to potentially fatal presentations. Predictors of VTE in COVID-19 are not fully defined, and the role of anticoagulation in these patients is debatable. Here we discuss two cases of COVID-19, who initially presented with mild COVID-19 symptoms and later with potentially fatal VTE within 30 days of initial presentation. The first case is of a 42-year-old gentleman with a history of sarcoidosis and a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia who was in isolation at home and presented with syncope and worsening shortness of breath. He was hemodynamically unstable and resuscitated with fluid management in the emergency department. The chest angiogram imaging studies showed massive pulmonary embolism with right heart strain, which was confirmed with bedside point-of-care ultrasound. The patient deteriorated clinically and received an intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in the emergency. He was discharged home under stable condition on oral anticoagulation. The second patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, sleep apnea, and a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was complicated with an ischemic stroke, who presented with worsening complaints of shortness of breath and palpitation. The chest angiogram imaging showed bilateral pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram showed mild right heart strain. The lower extremity duplex ultrasound showed bilateral deep vein thrombosis. The patient underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis and discharged on oral anticoagulation.

In this paper, we explore how governments can fulfill an important need as suppliers of liquidity. Building on the financing advantage view of state ownership, we theorize how state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may provide capital by offering trade credit to customer firms. The data indicate a positive relation between the level of state ownership and the provision of trade credit. Using an institution-focused framework, we further determine that the nations institutional environment systematically affects the opportunities and motivations for SOEs to grant trade credit. Specifically, we find that SOEs grant more trade credit in countries with less developed financial markets, weaker legal protection of creditors, less comprehensive information-sharing mechanisms, more collectivist societies, left-wing governments, and higher levels of unemployment. Firm-level factors also influence the credit-granting decisions of SOEs, with SOEs with lower levels of state ownership and higher extents of internationalization offering lower amounts of trade credit. Overall, our study offers novel insights regarding the important role of state-owned firms as providers of liquidity.

However, no study has evaluated the risk of SAH in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed data from 62 health care facilities using the Cerner de-identified COVID-19 dataset. RESULTS: There were 86 (0.1%) and 376 (0.2%) patients with SAH among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of SAH in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.4-0.7, P < 0.0001) after adjusting for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, and nicotine dependence/tobacco use. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.1% vs. 21.3%, P < 0.0001), acute kidney injury (43% vs. 27.7%, P = 0.0005), septic shock (44.2% vs. 20.7%, P < 0.0001), and respiratory failure (64.0% vs. 39.1%, P < 0.0001) were significantly higher among patients with SAH and COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19.

Surprisingly, given the expanding worldwide funding and research into Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare, there is a paucity of research exploring the public patient perspective on this technology. Our study sets out to address this knowledge gap, by applying the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to explore patient public views on AI. METHODS: A Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used involving four study groups with seven participants in each group. This started with a silent generation of ideas regarding the benefits and concerns of AI in Healthcare. Then a group discussion and round-robin process were conducted until no new ideas were generated. Participants ranked their top five benefits and top five concerns regarding the use of AI in healthcare. A final group consensus was reached. RESULTS: Twenty-Eight participants were recruited with the mean age of 47 years. The top five benefits were: Faster health services, Greater accuracy in management, AI systems available 24/7, reducing workforce burden, and equality in healthcare decision making. The top five concerns were: Data cybersecurity, bias and quality of AI data, less human interaction, algorithm errors and responsibility, and limitation in technology. CONCLUSION: This is the first formal qualitative study exploring patient public views on the use of AI in healthcare, and highlights that there is a clear understanding of the potential benefits delivered by this technology.

In humans, cadmium is poorly excreted, triggers pulmonary inflammation, reduces pulmonary function, and enhances lung injury by respiratory syncytial virus. OBJECTIVES: We examined the association of cadmium burden with mortality related to influenza or pneumonia. METHODS: This prospective analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) included 7,173 and 8,678 participants &#8805;45 years of age enrolled in NHANES-III and NHANES 1999-2006, respectively. Associations were evaluated between cadmium and mortality from influenza or pneumonia during a median follow-up of 17.3 y (NHANES-III, based on creatinine-corrected urine cadmium) and 11.4 y (NHANES 1999-2006, based on blood cadmium). Survey-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the mortality of individuals at the 80th vs. the 20th percentile of cadmium concentrations. RESULTS: In NHANES-III, after adjustment for sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, serum cholesterol, hypertension, and NHANES phase (or cycle), the HR comparing influenza or pneumonia mortality among participants with creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium in the 80th vs. 20th percentile was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.26; p=0.002) in the population as a whole and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.43; p=0.002) among never smokers.

Methods In this prospective cohort study, HCWs employed at hospitals in Copenhagen responded to a digital questionnaire at the beginning of the pandemic and again 10 months later. Results Seven-hundred-and-ninety-five HCWs responded to both questionnaires (83.4% females). The calculated one-year HE prevalence decreased from 16.0% at baseline to 13.0% at follow-up. Number of hand washings decreased significantly, while use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) on wet skin increased significantly. In a logistic regression model, increased use of ABHR on wet skin was associated with HE at follow-up (OR 1.78, 95%CI [1.11-2.87]). HR-QoL worsened slightly at follow-up, with HE severity and frequent flares being risk factors for a reduced HR-QoL.

In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur 'in person', 'by other appropriate means', or even, 'due to the exigencies of the public health emergency', not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that 'the exigencies of the public health emergency' might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist 'no earlier than the day before' the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals 'consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor'. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise 'necessary in the interest of the patient'. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days 'of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary'. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide 'a written statement' rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice.

Eventually, all patients were cured and discharged after treatment, and no recurrence of COVID-2019 induced pneumonia occurred after the discharge. The length of stays was shorter in group A as compared with group B, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in other general parameters between the patients of the groups A and B on the day of admission to the hospital (p > 0.05). The ALT, CK, and Cr levels did not significantly differ between groups A and B on the day of admission and the day of discharge (p > 0.05).

Methods We conducted a pilot study among patients on PrEP in San Francisco primary care clinics. Individuals on PrEP provided home-collected laboratory samples using dried blood spot for fourth-generation human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibody test, serum creatinine, syphilis antibody, and hepatitis C antibody, as needed;3-site (oropharyngeal, rectal, and urine) swabbing for sexually transmitted infections;and nasopharyngeal swabbing for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction. We examined feasibility and acceptability of collecting these laboratory samples using predefined benchmarks to determine feasibility or acceptability. Results Of 92 individuals who consented to participate, 73 (79.3%) mailed back their home-collected kit. Nearly 87.7% noted being extremely to moderately satisfied with the ability to complete the laboratory tests without having to come into a clinic. Approximately 49.3% of participants chose this home-collection method as their first choice for providing laboratory samples. Mean time from collection of samples by the participant to receipt of test results was reduced from the first quarter of the study (17 days) to the last quarter of the study (5 days). Conclusions We report high levels of feasibility and acceptability with the use of home-collected laboratory samples for patients on PrEP. Our results indicate that home-collected laboratory samples for patients on PrEP is a viable option that should be offered as an alternative to clinic-collected laboratory samples.

Echocardiographic, transcranial Doppler, and hemodynamic data from 37 neonates with moderate-severe HIE + TH were reviewed. Twenty healthy newborns served as controls. Cardiac dysfunction in HIE + TH was characterized by a predominant RV dysfunction, with concomitantly reduced CBF velocity. A significant correlation was found between CBF velocity and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV output (RVO), and stroke volume (SVRV), as well as with left ventricular output and stroke volume. Brain oxygenation (rSO2) correlated significantly with RVO, SVRV, TAPSE, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening, whereas cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOEc) correlated with RVO, SVRV, RV myocardial performance index, and superior vena cava flow. CBF velocity and cerebral NIRS correlations were stronger with parameters of right ventricular performance.Conclusion: CBF velocity and brain oxygenation correlate predominantly with RV function in HIE + TH. This suggests a preferential contribution of RV performance to cerebral hemodynamics in this context.What is Known:? Neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy frequently exhibit alterations of cardiac function and cerebral blood flow.?

This persistent state of ill health is known as Long COVID if it continues for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid has been overlooked in low and middle income countries. Therefore, we conducted an online survey among the COVID-19 survivors in the community to explore their Long COVID symptoms, factors associated with Long COVID and how Long COVID affected their work. MethodsThis was a cross sectional study conducted from July to September 2021, during the implementation of a nationwide movement control order (MCO). Data was collected using the REDCap electronic data capture tool. The questionnaire was distributed in social and news media. The questionnaire covers information such as socio-demographic characteristics, existing comorbidities, self-perception on health, information on the acute COVID-19 condition and treatment received, symptoms and duration of post-COVID condition and effects on occupation. Results: A total of 732 COVID-19 survivors responded. There were slightly more females (58.7%), younger and more highly educated respondents. More than half of them were overweight or obese and about two third were free of comorbidities. Among these respondents, about 56% were without or with mild symptoms during their acute COVID-19 conditions. A total of 21.1% of the respondents reported to experience Long COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms for Long COVID were fatigue, brain fog, depression, anxiety, insomnia, arthralgia or myalgia. Females had 58% higher odds (95% CI: 1.02, 2.45) of experiencing Long COVID. Patients with moderate and severe levels of acute COVID-19 symptoms had OR of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.21, 7.47) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.31, 10.03) respectively for Long COVID. ConclusionThis study provides additional insight on the symptoms and duration of post-COVID symptoms as well as the associated factors with Long COVID among COVID-19 survivors in Malaysia.

Mental health challenges such as making impossible decisions and working under extreme pressures are expected to be faced by frontline healthcare workers who are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. However, we question if significant stress levels might also be observed in a subspecialty musculoskeletal outpatient department, where staff are not first-line care providers of COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that these healthcare workers also face significant psychological strain, and we aim to objectively determine the prevalence using a validated caregiver strain index. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatient musculoskeletal clinics in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We collected basic demographic data and used a 13-question tool adapted from the validated Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) to measure psychological strain in these healthcare workers. Participants were divided into 2 groups depending on the level of strain experienced. RESULTS A total of 62 healthcare workers volunteered for this study. There were 32 participants (51.6%) who had 7 or more positive responses (group 1) and the remaining 30 participants (48.4%) were allocated to group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data. \\"Work adjustments\\" (74.2%), \\"changes in personal plans\\" (72.6%), and finding it \\"confining\\" (72.6%) garnered the most positive responses in the questionnaire.

Soon we identified on [(18)F]FDG PET-CT studies vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (VAHL) in axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes (ASLN) ipsilateral to the vaccination site. Sometimes, differentiation between the malignant and benign nature of the hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (HLN) could not be made, and equivocal HLN (EqHL) was reported. The purpose of the study was to determine the overall incidence of VAHL after BNT162b2 vaccination and also its relevance to PET-CT interpretation in oncologic patients. METHODS: A total of 951 consecutive patients that underwent [(18)F]FDG PET-CT studies in our department were interviewed regarding the sites and dates of the vaccine doses. A total of 728 vaccinated patients (All-Vac group) were included: 346 received the first dose only (Vac-1 group) and 382 received the booster dose as well (Vac-2 group). Studies were categorized as no HLN, malignant-HLN (MHL), VAHL, or EqHL. In studies with VAHL, location, [(18)F]FDG-intensity uptake and nodes size were recorded. RESULTS: The incidences of HLN were 45.6%, 36.4%, and 53.9% in All-Vac, Vac-1, and Vac-2 groups, respectively. VAHL was reported in 80.1% of vaccinated patients with HLN. Lower incidences of VAHL were found during the first 5 days or in the third week after the first vaccine and beyond 20 days after the booster dose. In 49 of 332 (14.8%) vaccinated patients, we could not determine whether HLN was MHL or VAHL. Breast cancer and lymphoma were the leading diseases with EqHL. CONCLUSION: VAHL is frequently observed after BNT162b2 administration, more commonly and with higher intensity following the booster dose. To minimize false and equivocal reports in oncological patients, timing of [(18)F]FDG PET-CT should be based on the time intervals found to have a lower incidence of VAHL, and choice of vaccine injection site should be advised, mainly in patients where ASLN are a relevant site of tumor involvement.","output":"Hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy following administration of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine: incidence assessed by [(18)F]FDG PET-CT and relevance to study interpretation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The initial lung lesions in two calves intrabronchially inoculated with Haemophilus somnus are described.

First, a search for synonyms (cultivars with identical genotypes) revealed 23 synonym groups among the Chinese chestnut cultivars, and all but one cultivar from each synonym group was omitted from further analyses. Second, genetic structure analysis showed a clear division between Japanese and Chinese chestnut, and most of the Japanese and Chinese cultivars had a simple genetic structure corresponding to the expected species. On the other hand, most Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars had admixed genetic structure. Through a combination of parentage and chloroplast haplotype analyses, 16 of the 18 hybrid cultivars in this study were inferred to have parent-offspring relationships with other cultivars originated in Japan. Finally, Bayesian clustering and chloroplast haplotype analysis showed that the 116 Chinese chestnut cultivars could be divided into two groups: one originated in the Hebei region of China and the other originated in the Jiangsu and Anhui regions of China.

Learning institutions host overcrowded accommodation and classrooms, especially in resource limited contexts. Understanding the global threat of the youth as an infection pool on the wider population is highlighted in the global response to COVID 19. This pilot study aimed to test the feasibility of recruiting university students contacts and demonstrate transmission of TB in Pwani University, Kilifi County-Kenya. Materials and Methods A pilot study among Pwani University TB index cases receiving treatment at the Kilifi County Hospital was conducted. Index cases who consented provided information about their household and social contacts. Contacts were identified and screened using a World Health Organization (WHO) symptom-based questionnaire. Their sputum samples were analysed using GeneXpert. Multivariate log-binomial regression was used to determine demographic and clinical characteristics associated with TB infection among contacts with TB index patients. Results A total of 51 index cases were recruited, median (IQR) age of 21 (20C23) years and 31 (61%) were males. 156 contacts were screened, median (IQR) age of 23 (20C23) years, 80 (51%) were males and 76 (49%) were household contacts. Among the 156 TB contacts, 5 participants were confirmed positive for TB: prevalence of 3.2% (95% CI 1.0 to 7.3%). 8/156 (5.1%, (95% CI 2.2 to 10%) contacts, had clinical diagnosed TB despite having a negative GeneXpert result.

Sharing a bed with an index case was the only factor significantly associated with TB infection among the five contacts with GeneXpert diagnosed TB. Conclusion Students sleeping in crowded hostels promote TB transmission within universities informing TB control interventions. Collaborating with existing national TB programme systems is a feasible approach to recruit people with active disease and their social contacts. Expansion of this approach to a larger population of students with TB infection may demonstrate the magnitude of TB transmission within universities, and the wider local communities.","output":"Sleeping with Tuberculosis: Do over-crowded university hostels in Kenya increase TB transmission among youths - A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Studies related to the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are scanty in Bangladesh, despite the growing necessity of understanding the population behavior related to vaccination. Thus, the present study was conducted to assess the prevalence of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Bangladesh to fill the knowledge gap. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study adopted a cross-sectional design to collect data from 1497 respondents using online (Google forms) and face-to-face interviews from eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh between 1C7 February 2021. We employed descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 46.2%. The Muslims (aOR = 1.80, p  0.01) and the respondents living in the city corporation areas (aOR = 2.14, p 0.001) had more hesitancy. There was significant variation in vaccine hesitancy by administrative divisions (geographic regions). Compared to the Sylhet division, the participants from Khulna (aOR = 1.31, p 0.001) had higher hesitancy. The vaccine hesitancy tended to decrease with increasing knowledge about the vaccine (aOR = 0.88, p0.001) and the vaccination process (aOR = 0.91, p  0.01). On the other hand, hesitancy increased with the increased negative attitudes towards the vaccine (aOR = 1.17, p0.001) and conspiracy beliefs towards the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR = 1.04, p0.01). The perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination (aOR = 0.85, p0.001) were negatively associated with hesitancy, while perceived barriers (aOR = 1.16, p 0.001) were positively associated. The participants were more hesitant to accept the vaccine from a specific country of origin (India, USA, Europe). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings warrant that a vigorous behavior change communication campaign should be designed and implemented to demystify negative public attitudes and conspiracy beliefs regarding the COVID-19 Vaccine in Bangladesh. The policymakers should also think about revisiting the policy of the online registration process to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, as online registration is a key structural barrier for many due to the persistent digital divide in the country. Finally, the government should consider the populations preference regarding vaccines country of manufacture to reduce the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the adult population in Bangladesh: A nationwide cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This presentation contains data on the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the airlines industry, as well as projections for recovery","output":"Tracking the Impacts of COVID-19 [presentation]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, ultraviolet-C (UV-C) decontamination of N95 respirators for emergency reuse has been implemented to mitigate shortages. Pathogen photoinactivation efficacy depends critically on UV-C dose, which is distance- and angle-dependent and thus varies substantially across N95 surfaces within a decontamination system. Due to nonuniform and system-dependent UV-C dose distributions, characterizing UV-C dose and resulting pathogen inactivation with sufficient spatial resolution on-N95 is key to designing and validating UV-C decontamination protocols. However, robust quantification of UV-C dose across N95 facepieces presents challenges, as few UV-C measurement tools have sufficient (1) small, flexible form factor, and (2) angular response. To address this gap, we combine optical modeling and quantitative photochromic indicator (PCI) dosimetry with viral inactivation assays to generate high-resolution maps of on-N95 UV-C dose and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 viral inactivation across N95 facepieces within a commercial decontamination chamber. Using modeling to rapidly identify on-N95 locations of interest, in-situ measurements report a 17.4  5.0-fold dose difference across N95 facepieces in the chamber, yielding 2.9  0.2-log variation in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. UV-C dose at several on-N95 locations was lower than the lowest-dose locations on the chamber floor, highlighting the importance of on-N95 dose validation. Overall, we integrate optical simulation with in-situ PCI dosimetry to relate UV-C dose and viral inactivation at specific on-N95 locations, establishing a versatile approach to characterize UV-C photoinactivation of pathogens contaminating complex substrates such as N95s.","output":"Mapping of UV-C dose and SARS-CoV-2 viral inactivation across N95 respirators during decontamination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) require significant healthcare resources. While published research has shown clinical characteristics associated with severe illness from COVID-19, there is limited data focused on the emergency department (ED) discharge population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all ED-discharged patients from Wake Forest Baptist Health and Wake Forest Baptist Health Davie Medical Center between April 25CAugust 9, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a nasopharyngeal swab using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients who were discharged and had return visits within 30 days to those patients who did not return to the ED within 30 days. RESULTS: Our study included 235 adult patients who had an ED-performed SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR positive test and were subsequently discharged on their first ED visit. Of these patients, 57 (24.3%) had return visits to the ED within 30 days for symptoms related to COVID-19. Of these 57 patients, on return ED visits 27 were admitted to the hospital and 30 were not admitted. Of the 235 adult patients who were discharged, 11.5% (27) eventually required admission for COVID-19-related symptoms. With 24.3% patients having a return ED visit after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and 11.5% requiring eventual admission, it is important to understand clinical characteristics associated with return ED visits. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis of the clinical characteristics with independent association resulting in a return ED visit, which demonstrated the following: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 2.990, 95% confidence interval [CI, 1.21C7.40, P = 0.0179); transaminitis (OR 8.973, 95% CI, 2.65C30.33, P = 0.004); increased pulse at triage (OR 1.04, 95% CI, 1.02C1.07, P = 0.0002); and myalgia (OR 4.43, 95% CI, 2.03C9.66, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: As EDs across the country continue to treat COVID-19 patients, it is important to understand the clinical factors associated with ED return visits related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified key clinical characteristics associated with return ED visits for patients initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection: diabetes mellitus; increased pulse at triage; transaminitis; and complaint of myalgias.","output":"Clinical Characteristics Associated with Return Visits to the Emergency Department after COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High throughput sequencing is currently revolutionizing the genomics field and providing new approaches to the detection and characterization of microorganisms. The objective of this study was to assess the detection of influenza D virus (IDV) in bovine respiratory tract samples using two sequencing platforms (MiSeq and Nanopore (GridION)), and species-specific qPCR. An IDV-specific qPCR was performed on 232 samples (116 nasal swabs and 116 tracheal washes) that had been previously subject to virome sequencing using MiSeq. Nanopore sequencing was performed on 19 samples positive for IDV by either MiSeq or qPCR. Nanopore sequence data was analyzed by two bioinformatics methods: Whats In My Pot (WIMP, on the EPI2ME platform), and an in-house developed analysis pipeline. The agreement of IDV detection between qPCR and MiSeq was 82.3%, between qPCR and Nanopore was 57.9% (in-house) and 84.2% (WIMP), and between MiSeq and Nanopore was 89.5% (in-house) and 73.7% (WIMP). IDV was detected by MiSeq in 14 of 17 IDV qPCR-positive samples with Cq (cycle quantification) values below 31, despite multiplexing 50 samples for sequencing. When qPCR was regarded as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of MiSeq sequence detection were 28.3% and 98.9%, respectively. We conclude that both MiSeq and Nanopore sequencing are capable of detecting IDV in clinical specimens with a range of Cq values.

This study reports the application and evaluation of candidate MST methods (phages infecting previously isolated B. fragilis strain GB-124, newly isolated Bacteroides strains (K10, K29, and K33) and recently isolated Kluyvera intermedia strain ASH-08), along with non-source specific somatic coliphages (SOMCPH infecting strain WG-5) and indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli) for identifying fecal contamination pathways in Kolkata, India. Source specificity of the phage-based methods was first tested using 60 known non-human fecal samples from common animals, before being evaluated with 56 known human samples (municipal sewage) collected during both the rainy and dry season. SOMCPH were present in 40-90% of samples from different animal species and in 100% of sewage samples. Phages infecting Bacteroides strain GB-124 were not detected from the majority (95%) of animal samples (except in three porcine samples) and were present in 93 and 71% of the sewage samples in the rainy and dry season (Mean = 1.42 and 1.83 log(10)PFU/100mL, respectively), though at lower levels than SOMCPH (Mean = 3.27 and 3.02 log(10)PFU/100mL, respectively). Phages infecting strain ASH-08 were detected in 89 and 96% of the sewage samples in the rainy and dry season, respectively, but were also present in all animal samples tested (except goats). Strains K10, K29, and K30 were not found to be useful MST markers due to low levels of phages and/or co-presence in non-human sources. GB-124 and SOMCPH were subsequently deployed within two low-income neighborhoods to determine the levels and origin of fecal contamination in 110 environmental samples. E. coli, SOMCPH, and phages of GB-124 were detected in 68, 42, and 28% of the samples, respectively. Analyses of 166 wastewater samples from shared community toilets and 21 samples from sewage pumping stations from the same districts showed that SOMCPH were present in 100% and GB-124 phages in 31% of shared toilet samples (Median = 5.59 and <1 log(10) PFU/100 mL, respectively), and both SOMCPH and GB-124 phages were detected in 95% of pumping station samples (Median = 5.82 and 4.04 log(10) PFU/100 mL, respectively).

Previous reports have confirmed that hyperglycemia can increase the risk of mortality in patients cared in the intensive care unit (ICU). In addition, severe and multiple hypoglycemia increases the risk of mortality when using insulin or intensive antidiabetic therapy. The innovation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may help to alert medical caregivers with regard to the development of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, which may decrease the potential complications in patients in the ICU. The major limitation of CGM is the measurement of interstitial glucose levels rather than real-time blood glucose levels; thus, there will be a delay in the treatment of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in patients. Recently, the European Union approved a state-of-art artificial intelligence directed loop system coordinated by CGM and a continuous insulin pump for diabetes control, which may provide a practical way to prevent acute adverse glycemic events related to antidiabetic therapy in critically ill patients.

The aim of this study was to describe national, 60-day all-cause mortality associated with COVID-19, and to identify risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including the first consecutive 5000 patients with COVID-19 in Qatar who completed 60 days of follow up by June 17, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, we explored risk factors for admission to ICU. RESULTS: Included patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 28 and April 17, 2020. The majority (4436, 88.7%) were males and the median age was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28C43]. By 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 14 patients (0.28%) had died, 10 (0.2%) were still in hospital, and two (0.04%) were still in ICU. Fatal COVID-19 cases had a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 55.8C68), and were mostly males (13, 92.9%). All included pregnant women (26, 0.5%), children (131, 2.6%), and healthcare workers (135, 2.7%) were alive and not hospitalized at the end of follow up. A total of 1424 patients (28.5%) required hospitalization, out of which 108 (7.6%) were admitted to ICU. Most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized adults were diabetes (23.2%), and hypertension (20.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022C1.061 per year increase; P < 0.001], male sex (aOR 4.375, 95% CI 1.964C9.744; P < 0.001), diabetes (aOR 1.698, 95% CI 1.050C2.746; P 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aOR 3.590, 95% CI 1.596C8.079, P 0.002), and higher BMI (aOR 1.067, 95% CI 1.027C1.108 per unit increase; P 0.001), were all independently associated with increased risk of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively younger national cohort with a low co-morbidity burden, COVID-19 was associated with low all-cause mortality. Independent risk factors for ICU admission included older age, male sex, higher BMI, and co-existing diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of COVID-19 infection among immunized versus non-immunized COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. METHOD: A prospective observational cohort study, including all COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit between January 1st, 2021 and June 30th, 2021 were eligible for inclusion. A comparison of severity upon hospitalization of immunized versus non-immunized patients on a 7-level ordinal scale was conducted, using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: 592 patients were enrolled, 524 (88.5%) non-immunized, 63 (10.6%) partially immunized, and 5 (0.9%) fully immunized, partially and fully immunized patients were grouped together. Majority of immunized patients (86.7%) were symptomatic before 21 days of immunization. Non-immunized group had fewer patients in the lower severity categories, while more patients in the higher severity categories compared to immunized group. At least one dose of immunization was associated with reduction of odds of moving up severity scale (OR = 0.2 [95% CI: 0.15C0.4]; p < 0.001) in a well fitted ordinal logistic regression model. At least one dose of immunization was associated with lower adjusted odds of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR = 0.45 [95% CI: 0.23C0.89]; p = 0.02). Non-immunized group had higher mortality rate (43.9% versus 29.4% [95% CI: 1.5 to 25.8]; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Most COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were non-immunized, most of the partially immunized patients got infected before immunity could develop, and fully immunized patients were likely non-responders. At least one dose of immunization significantly decreases severity of the disease across all ordinal severity categories, and is significantly associated with lower 30 day all-cause mortality.

With Covid-19, the growth is essentially power-type, especially during the middle stages, and the saturation is currently mostly due to the protective measures. Focusing on these features and the role of epidemic management, we obtain differential equations for the total number of detected cases of Covid-19, which describe the actual curves in many countries almost with the accuracy of physics laws. The two-phase solution we propose works very well almost for the whole periods of the spread practically in all countries we analyzed that reached the saturation during the first waves. Bessel functions play the key role in our approach. Due to a very small number of parameters, namely, the initial transmission rate and the intensity of the hard and soft measures, we obtain a convincing explanation of the surprising uniformity of the curves of the total numbers of detected infections in many different areas. This theory can serve as a tool for forecasting the epidemic spread and evaluating the efficiency of the protective measures, which is very much needed for epidemics.

Methods In this retrospective observational chart review-based study we recruited 396 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 2020 to May 2020 from two regional medical centers in New Jersey, USA. Patients baseline characteristics, secondary diagnoses, and laboratory findings were manually extracted and compared among two groups: patients with cardiac arrhythmias and those without. Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation of cardiac arrhythmias and increased oxygen requirement, which are: room air (RA), nasal cannula (NC), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation (BIPAP/MV). Results The demographic characteristics of the patients were: aged 61 +/- 18.7 years (mean +/- standard deviation); with 56% being male, and 44.9% of African American race. There were 16% patients on RA, 40% on NC, 15% on HFNC, and 29% on BIPAP/MV. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was 36.7% (20% pulseless electrical activity (PEA), 13.5% atrial fibrillation (AF). 56% of AF was new-onset arrhythmia. Compared to the RA group, the risk of cardiac arrhythmias was significantly higher in BIPAP/MV (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.8 - 6.2, p <0.001) and HFNC (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.5-5.7, p0.001), but not in NC group (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.4-1.8, p0.89).

This study explored the levels and causes of moral distress and the ethical climate in Dutch ICUs during COVID-19. METHODS: An extended version of the Measurement of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) and Ethical Decision Making Climate Questionnaire (EDMCQ) were online distributed among all 84 ICUs. Moral distress scores in nurses and intensivists were compared with the historical control group one year before COVID-19. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-five nurses (70.7%), 40 intensivists (8.2%), and 103 supporting staff (21.1%) completed the survey. Moral distress levels were higher for nurses than supporting staff. Moral distress levels in intensivists did not differ significantly from those of nurses and supporting staff. Inadequate emotional support for patients and their families was the highest-ranked cause of moral distress for all groups of professionals. Of all factors, all professions rated the ethical climate most positively regarding the culture of mutual respect, ethical awareness and support. Culture of not avoiding end-of-life-decisions and Self-reflective and empowering leadership received the lowest mean scores. Moral distress scores during COVID-19 were significantly lower for ICU nurses (p < 0.001) and intensivists (p < 0.05) compared to one year prior.

Asthma is often associated with comorbid allergic diseases, and its severity may be modulated by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergen sensitization. Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, the first biological therapy approved to treat patients aged 6 years with severe allergic asthma. The primary objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of Omalizumab in Romanian children with severe allergic asthma. METHODS: In this observational real-life study, 12 children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years (mean 12.4 years) with severe allergic asthma received Omalizumab as an add-on treatment. Asthma control, exacerbations, lung function, and adverse events were evaluated at baseline and after the first year of treatment. RESULTS: We observed general improvement in total asthma symptom scores and reduction in the rate of exacerbation of severe asthma. Omalizumab treatment was associated with improvement in the measures of lung function, and no serious adverse reactions were reported. FEV1 improved significantly after one year of treatment with Omalizumab [FEV1 (% pred.) = 18.3], and [similarly, MEF50 (%) = 25.8].

These aspects of globalisation have implications for medicine and the law, yet child medical tourism has been little examined. We argue that it affects a range of interests, including childrens rights, parents rights as consumers, and the interests of society in communalised healthcare. Identifying putative solutions and a research agenda around these issues is important. While cases involving critically ill children are complex and emotionally fraught, the interconnectedness of these issues requires the law to engage and respond coherently to the impacts of healthcare globalisation.","output":"Medical Tourism and the Best Interests of the Critically ill Child in the Era of Healthcare Globalisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a heartbreaking situation across the globe. It is affecting the human population both in terms of health issues and food safety concerns. Most of the countries are struggling to save their economies during the lock-down conditions. The fight against the COVID-19 is very tough; either one can save the economy or save his country's human population. It seems COVID-19 have all the negative impact across the world. However, there is also some positive impact of this pandemic, where we observe much reduced environmental pollution. There has been significant improvement in the air quality at almost all the places where lock-down is implemented. Air pollution directly affects our health and hence the quality of life. In India, air quality has improved much beyond our expectations during the lock-down. This paper studies the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution in major Indian cities. In the air quality rating, the paper considers types of air pollutants like Particulate Matters and Gaseous Components as benchmarks. Authors have also used available literature to study the ongoing pollution measurements, impact, and change over time. The study analysed available air quality data of four metros, i.e., Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai, over the four months (National Lockdown). Two particulate matters (PM-2.5 and PM-10) pollution levels are compared with last year's values to identify the significant variations. Moreover, Gaseous components are used to analyse their impact on the country's human health and food ecosystem. The study analyses the effect of COVID-19 on air pollution, and the general recommendations are given. Paper identifies that there is a very good or positive impact of closing polluting units and vehicular movements.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Particulate Matter (PM) concentration and harmful gaseous components on Indian metros"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate trends in racial and ethnic disparities in weekly cumulative rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths in Connecticut nursing homes. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of nursing-home COVID-19 reports and other databases. Multivariable negative binomial models were used to estimate disparities in COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates across nursing-home groups with varying proportions of racial and ethnic minority residents, defined as low-, medium-, medium-high-, and high-proportion groups. Trends in such disparities were estimated from week 1 (April 13) to week 10 (ending on June 19, 2020). SETTING: The study was conducted across 211 nursing homes. RESULTS: The average number of cases ranged from 6.1 cases per facility for the low-proportion group to 11.7 cases per facility for the high-proportion group in week 1, and from 26.7 to 58.5 cases per facility in week 10. Compared to the low-proportion group, the adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the high-proportion group were 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77C1.80; P > .10) in week 1 and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.05C2.25; P < .05) in week 10, showing a 30% (95% CI, 5%C62%) relative increase (P < .05). The average weekly number of COVID-19Crelated deaths ranged from 0 to 0.3 deaths per facility for different groups in week 1, and from 7.6 to 13.3 deaths per facility in week 10. Adjusted disparities in fatalities similarly increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Connecticut nursing homes caring for predominately racial and ethnic minority residents tended to have higher COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates.

Humans possess 31 pairs of DRG lying along the spine. These ganglia have unique anatomical and physiological features. During development, DRG are extruded from the central nervous system and from the blood-brain barrier but remain surrounded by meningeal layers and by cerebrospinal fluid. DRG house the pain-transmitting small nerve fiber nuclei; each individual nucleus is tightly enveloped by metabolically active glial cells. DRG possess multiple inflammatory/pro-nociceptive molecules including ion channels, neuropeptides, lymphocytes, and macrophages. DRG neurons have pseudo-unipolar structure making them able to generate pain signals; additionally, they can sequester antigen-specific antibodies thus inducing immune-mediated hyperalgesia. In rodents, diverse physical and/or environmental stressors induce DRG phenotypic changes and hyperalgesia. Unfolding clinical evidence links DRG pathology to fibromyalgia and similar syndromes. Severe fibromyalgia is associated to particular DRG ion channel genotype. Myalgic encephalomyelitis patients with comorbid fibromyalgia have exercise-induced DRG pro-nociceptive molecules gene overexpression. Skin biopsy demonstrates small nerve fiber pathology in approximately half of fibromyalgia patients. A confocal microscopy study of fibromyalgia patients disclosed strong correlation between corneal denervation and small fiber neuropathy symptom burden. DRG may be fibromyalgia neural hub where different stressors can be transformed in neuropathic pain. Novel neuroimaging technology and postmortem inquest may better define DRG involvement in fibromyalgia and similar maladies.

We aimed to investigate how these changes have been perceived by patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and identify determinants of increased anxiety. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An anonymized 32-item survey in the specialized lower gastrointestinal cancer outpatient clinics at a tertiary cancer center in North West England between May 18 and July 1, 2020. Self-reported anxiety was based on the General Anxiety Disorder-7 screening tool. RESULTS: Of 143 participants who completed the survey (response rate, 67%), 115 (82%) were male, and the median age group was 61 to 70 years. A total of 112 (78%) participants had telephone consultation (83% met needs), and 57 (40%) had radiologic scan results discussed over the phone (96% met needs). In total, 23 (18%) participants were considered to have anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7 score &#8805; 5), with 7 (5.5%) scoring for moderate or severe anxiety. Those concerned about getting COVID-19 infection, and worried COVID-19 would have effect on their mental health, and affect their experience of cancer care, were most likely to have anxiety (P < .05, multivariate analysis). The majority did not feel they needed support during this phase of the pandemic. Participants felt that friends and family had been very supportive, but less so the primary care services (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this survey suggest that some of the service changes implemented may have already improved the overall experience of cancer care among patients with colorectal cancer at our institute. Reassuringly, the incidence of participants with moderate to severe anxiety levels during the peak of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom was much lower than anticipated. Importantly, patients were much more concerned about their cancer treatment than COVID-19, emphasizing the need to continue to provide comprehensive cancer care even with a \\"second wave\\" of COVID-19.","output":"The Impact of Changes in Service Delivery in Patients With Colorectal Cancer During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A flare-up of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) started in the city of Wuhan in China and is viewed as another strain that has not been distinguished earlier in people.

Design(s): Literature review. Setting(s): Multidisciplinary medical institution Participants: None. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): None. Result(s): The long-term sequelae in COVID-19 survivors is largely unknown and emerging studies have begun to identify cognitive and psychiatric symptoms as consequences in some individuals. Cognitive abilities most adversely impacted include attention, memory and executive functioning. Survivors of life-threatening illnesses, especially individuals with a history of lengthy ICU stays, are known to exhibit significant psychiatric sequelae, including elevated anxiety, depression, and symptoms of PTSD;all of which are known to exacerbate existing cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions have been utilized in a variety of neurological populations with similar concomitant cognitive and psychiatric symptoms noted in the limited extant literature describing survivors of COVID-19. Integrated use of these evidenced-based CR and CBT interventions is necessary to address the interplay of cognitive and emotional symptomatology that can impede functional recovery in these patients. Conclusion(s): An integrated treatment approach that incorporates both CR and CBT interventions can be used to address the cognitive, behavioral, and psychological manifestations observed in patients with COVID-19 in order to maximize a survivor's level of daily functioning and facilitate re-integration into daily activities. Until further research assessing treatment efficacy in this population can be conducted, rehabilitation specialists should adapt known CR/CBT protocols that are used in disorders that present with similar pathology, as well as neurocognitive and emotional challenges as those in this novel disease.

This systematic review critically appraised, compared and summarised the measurement properties of lymphoedema-specific self-reported questionnaires (SRQs) measuring various patient-reported outcomes including quality of life (QOL), function, morbidity, and symptoms. METHODS Seven databases were searched to identify studies of the measurement properties of SRQs. Two review teams independently evaluated the quality of the individual studies using the risk of bias tool from the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN). Measurement properties of the SRQs presented in the studies were then rated. Study level ratings were summarised for an SRQ if they were reported in multiple studies, and their overall quality of the evidence were then graded. RESULTS Forty articles, reporting on 19 SRQs were identified from 8615 records. The focus of the 19 SRQs included eight on QOL, four on symptoms, two on function, and two on impairment. The other three SRQs were on illness perception, self-efficacy, and patient-relevant treatment benefit, respectively. Eight and three SRQs were upper limb and lower limb-specific, respectively, whereas seven questionnaires were for both upper and lower limb lymphoedema. One SRQ was developed for head and neck lymphoedema. According to the COSMIN framework, none of the SRQs reviewed had sufficient evidence to support all nine measurement properties. In lower limb questionnaires, the LYMQOL-leg has sufficient content, structural, and construct validity as well as internal consistency and reliability. For upper limb lymphoedema questionnaires, the Lymph-ICF-UL had sufficient content and construct validity as well as reliability. CONCLUSION LYMQOL-leg SRQ is recommended with confidence for evaluation of QOL of people with lower limb lymphoedema while the Lymph-ICF-UL is recommended for evaluation of the QOL of the breast cancer-related lymphoedema with some confidence. In view of the high level of the indeterminate ratings of the measurement properties of the existing SRQs, further research is desirable.","output":"Self-reported questionnaires for lymphoedema: a systematic review of measurement properties using COSMIN framework."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although most autoimmune diseases are considered to be CD4 T cell\\\\ or antibody\\\\mediated, many respond to CD20\\\\depleting antibodies that have limited influence on CD4 and plasma cells.

Therefore, the enlargement of its membership to countries outside of the boundaries of the geographical area is outlined as well as its internal organization and the actions performed to promote the interaction among the member countries, especially the biyearly conferences. The international scenario is depicted to explain the criticalities experienced in promoting sericultural activities in the region, as well as the opportunities offered by the new applications of the silk, silk proteins and mulberry derivatives. ABSTRACT: The history and recent activities of the Black Caspian Seas and Central Asia Silk Association are presented in this paper: the countries that participated in its foundation, the FAOs action to revitalize sericulture in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the following widening of the Association geographical limits of to enclose other European countries, which were not well-represented in other similar organizations. Some statistical data are illustrated for a better description of the scenario in which the BACSA executive board acted: the world silk production quantity and the relative production of BACSA countries in respect to the Chinese expansion. The themes treated in the BACSA conferences are reported to explain which matters the Executive Board considered the most relevant for the relaunch of this activity in relationships to the international challenges in the subsequent years; the project proposals that were presented to international donors are summarized. A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis is shown, where key-factors in determining the strengths and weaknesses of this organization and its member countries for a successful re-establishment of sericulture, are considered.

However, under severe and persistent ER stress, prolonged UPR may activate unique pathways that lead to cell death. In this study, we investigated the activation of the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway of UPR in cells infected with the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and its relationship with IBV-induced apoptosis. The results showed moderate induction of PERK phosphorylation in IBV-infected cells. Meanwhile, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) was upregulated at the protein level in the infected cells, resulting in the induction in trans of the transcription factor ATF3 and the proapoptotic growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD153. Knockdown of PERK by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the activation of GADD153 and the IBV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, knockdown of protein kinase R (PKR) by siRNA and inhibition of the PKR kinase activity by 2-aminopurine (2-AP) also reduced the IBV-induced upregulation of GADD153 and apoptosis induction. In GADD153-knockdown cells, IBV-induced apoptosis was suppressed and virus replication inhibited, revealing a key role of GADD153 in IBV-induced cell death and virus replication. Analysis of the pathways downstream of GADD153 revealed much more activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway in GADD153-knockdown cells during IBV infection, indicating that GADD153 may modulate apoptosis through suppression of the pathway. This study provides solid evidence that induction of GADD153 by PERK and PKR plays an important regulatory role in the apoptotic process triggered by IBV infection.","output":"Upregulation of CHOP/GADD153 during coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus infection modulates apoptosis by restricting activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To describe the incidental detection of COVID-19 disease on positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in a patient with cancer despite initial negative swab by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

One of the biopsies is located in the vicinity of the region where the tumor received the prescribed dose of radiation, and thus exposed to LDIR; the other specimen, outside all beam apertures, was used as an internal calibrator (IC). Microvessel density (MDV) was quantified by immunohistochemistry and the expression of angiogenic, pro-inflammatory, adhesion and oxidative stress genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using exclusively endothelial cells (ECs) isolated by laser capture microdissection microscopy. RESULTS: LDIR activated peritumoral ECs by significantly up-regulating the expression of several pro-angiogenic genes such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2, ANGPT2, TGFB2, VWF, FGF2, HGF and PDGFC and down-regulating the pro-inflammatory IL8 marker. Accordingly, the MVD was significantly increased in peritumoral tissues exposed to LDIR, compared to the IC. The patients that yielded a larger pro-angiogenic response, also showed the highest MVD. CONCLUSIONS: LDIR activate ECs in peritumoral tissues that are associated with increased MVD. Although the technological advances in radiotherapy have contributed to reduce the damage to healthy tissues over the past years, the anatomical regions receiving LDIR should be taken into account in the treatment plan report for patient follow-up and in future studies to correlate these doses with tumor dissemination.","output":"Low doses of ionizing radiation activate endothelial cells and induce angiogenesis in peritumoral tissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adolescents can easily access esports betting sites and place bets using cash or skins.

However, it is proving to be more dangerous during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tobacco use may increase the risk of being infected, increases the chances of complications, and also increases the probability of its spread. We assessed the awareness about this association and the impact of the lockdown on tobacco use among tobacco users registered before the lockdown for LifeFirst, a tobacco dependence treatment program. METHODS: 1016 tobacco users were under active follow-up in their course of the 6-month counselling program. From 14 to 28 May 2020, 650 (64%) of these registered users were contacted by counsellors for follow-up sessions over the telephone. Semi-structured questionnaires were filled in during the calls. RESULTS: Two-thirds (67%) of tobacco users were unaware of the association between tobacco and COVID-19. Only 30% of the users felt that the current situation had affected their tobacco use, the commonest impacts being unavailability and increased prices of tobacco products. While this was seen as an opportunity to quit by some users, some reported increased tobacco use due to increased stress. Of the 219 (34%) tobacco users who quit tobacco during the lockdown, 51% quit because of the lockdown and their concern over COVID-19. Abstinence among those who were aware of the association between the coronavirus and tobacco was twice that among those who were not aware. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness activities about the harmful effects of tobacco during the coronavirus pandemic have to be strengthened. Measures to motivate and support tobacco users to quit have to be provided through cessation services.","output":"How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected tobacco users in India: Lessons from an ongoing tobacco cessation program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aspergillus fumigatus is an environmental filamentous fungus that can be pathogenic for humans, wherein it is responsible for a large variety of clinical forms ranging from allergic diseases to life-threatening disseminated infections.

While both compounds promote recovery, CX-4945 is a selective Casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitor and MS-275 is a selective Class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Alterations in microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate some of the protective actions of these drugs. In this study, we aimed to (1) identify miRNAs expressed in mouse optic nerves (MONs); (2) determine which miRNAs are regulated by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD); and (3) determine the effects of CX-4945 and MS-275 treatment on miRNA expression. RNA isolated from MONs from control and OGD-treated animals with and without CX-4945 or MS-275 treatment were quantified using NanoString nCounter(?) miRNA expression profiling. Comparative analysis of experimental groups revealed that 12 miRNAs were expressed at high levels in MONs. OGD upregulated five miRNAs (miR-1959, miR-501-3p, miR-146b, miR-201, and miR-335-3p) and downregulated two miRNAs (miR-1937a and miR-1937b) compared to controls. OGD with CX-4945 upregulated miR-1937a and miR-1937b, and downregulated miR-501-3p, miR-200a, miR-1959, and miR-654-3p compared to OGD alone. OGD with MS-275 upregulated miR-2134, miR-2141, miR-2133, miR-34b-5p, miR-153, miR-487b, miR-376b, and downregulated miR-717, miR-190, miR-27a, miR-1959, miR-200a, miR-501-3p, and miR-200c compared to OGD alone. Interestingly, miR-501-3p and miR-1959 were the only miRNAs upregulated by OGD, and downregulated by OGD plus CX-4945 and MS-275. Therefore, we suggest that protective functions of CX-4945 or MS-275 against WM injury maybe mediated, in part, through miRNA expression.","output":"Identification of miRNAs That Mediate Protective Functions of Anti-Cancer Drugs During White Matter Ischemic Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of nutrition on immunity is an intense area of research Malnutrition is linked to a higher risk of microbial infections, while severe infections usually lead to a nutritional imbalance in affected patients The nutritional status has an impact on the severity of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection Studies conducted on small number of patients have shown the benefits of maintaining optimal Vitamin (B12 and D) and mineral (zinc and magnesium) balance in reducing the intensity of COVID-19 Although consuming a balanced diet with a healthy lifestyle is always desirable, the importance of such practice is even more meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic Keeping an optimal balance of vitamins and minerals through healthy dietary habits helps to maintain a robust immune system that is essential to combat invading microbial pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: Can Boosting Immune Responses by Maintaining Adequate Nutritional Balance Reduce Viral Insults?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women, girls, and vulnerable populations have been disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The modified gold nanoparticles (TADACAuNPs) were first prepared by sodium citrate (Na(3)Ct) reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl(4)) and then capped with a TADA ligand. Five TADACAuNPs sensors were constructed with sodium citrate (Na(3)Ct)/chloroauric acid (HAuCl(4)) under different molar ratios. Results showed that the molar ratio of Na(3)Ct/HAuCl(4), TADACAuNPs concentration, pH range and detection time had obvious influences on the performance of this colorimetric method. The optimal detection conditions for Al(3+) ions were as follows: Na(3)Ct/HAuCl4 molar ratio of 6.4 : 1, 0.1 mM of TADACAuNPs concentration, 4C10 pH range and 90 s of detection time. Under the optimal conditions and using diphenyl carbazone (DPC) as a Cr(3+) masking agent, this colorimetric sensor exhibited outstanding time efficiency, selectivity and sensitivity for Al(3+) detection. In particular, the detection limits of this sensor obtained via UV-vis and the naked eye were 15 nM and 1.5 M, respectively, which were much lower than the current limit (3.7 M) for drinking water in WHO regulation and better than the previous reports.

Objective To describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with and without TTS. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used data from an international registry of consecutive patients with CVST within 28 days of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination included between March 29 and June 18, 2021, from 81 hospitals in 19 countries. For reference, data from patients with CVST between 2015 and 2018 were derived from an existing international registry. Clinical characteristics and mortality rate were described for adults with (1) CVST in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, (2) CVST after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination not fulling criteria for TTS, and (3) CVST unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Exposures Patients were classified as having TTS if they had new-onset thrombocytopenia without recent exposure to heparin, in accordance with the Brighton Collaboration interim criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical characteristics and mortality rate. Results Of 116 patients with postvaccination CVST, 78 (67.2%) had TTS, of whom 76 had been vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCov-19; 38 (32.8%) had no indication of TTS. The control group included 207 patients with CVST before the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 63 of 78 (81%), 30 of 38 (79%), and 145 of 207 (70.0%) patients, respectively, were female, and the mean (SD) age was 45 (14), 55 (20), and 42 (16) years, respectively. Concomitant thromboembolism occurred in 25 of 70 patients (36%) in the TTS group, 2 of 35 (6%) in the no TTS group, and 10 of 206 (4.9%) in the control group, and in-hospital mortality rates were 47% (36 of 76; 95% CI, 37-58), 5% (2 of 37; 95% CI, 1-18), and 3.9% (8 of 207; 95% CI, 2.0-7.4), respectively.

Firstly, it reduces the inflammatory response through the inhibition of the Januse-Kinase signalling transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Moreover, it reduces the receptor mediated viral endocytosis by AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) inhibition. We propose the use of baricinitib to prevent the progression of the respiratory insufficiency in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia in onco-haematological patients. In this phase Ib/II study, the primary objective in the safety cohort is to describe the incidence of severe adverse events associated with baricitinib administration. The primary objective of the randomized phase (baricitinib cohort versus standard of care cohort) is to evaluate the number of patients who did not require mechanical oxygen support since start of therapy until day +14 or discharge (whichever it comes first). The secondary objectives of the study (only randomized phase of the study) are represented by the comparison between the two arms of the study in terms of mortality and toxicity at day+30. Moreover, a description of the immunological related changes between the two arms of the study will be reported. TRIAL DESIGN: The trial is a phase I/II study with a safety run-in cohort (phase 1) followed by an open label phase II randomized controlled trial with an experimental arm compared to a standard of care arm. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be performed at the Institut Catal dOncologia, a tertiary level oncological referral center in the Catalonia region (Spain). The eligibility criteria are: patients > 18 years affected by oncological diseases; ECOG performance status < 2 (Karnofsky score > 60%); a laboratory confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 by means of real -time PCR; radiological signs of low respiratory tract disease; absence of organ dysfunction (a total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, AST/ALT2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, coagulation within normal institutional limits, creatinine clearance >30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal); absence of HIV infection; no active or latent HBV or HCV infection. The exclusion criteria are: patients with oncological diseases who are not candidates to receive any active oncological treatment; hemodynamic instability at time of study enrollment; impossibility to receive oral medication; medical history of recent or active pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis or patients at high-risk of suffering them (surgical intervention, immobilization); multi organ failure, rapid worsening of respiratory function with requirement of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) > 50% or high-flow nasal cannula before initiation of study treatment; uncontrolled intercurrent illness (ongoing or severe active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements); allergy to one or more of study treatments; pregnant or breastfeeding women; positive pregnancy test in a pre-dose examination. Patients should have the ability to understand, and the willingness to sign, a written informed consent document; the willingness to accept randomization to any assigned treatment arm; and must agree not to enroll in another study of an investigational agent prior to completion of Day +28 of study. An electronic Case Report Form in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform will be used to collect the data of the trial. Removal from the study will apply in case of unacceptable adverse event(s), development of an intercurrent illness, condition or procedural complication, which could interfere with the patients continued participation and voluntary patient withdrawal from study treatment (all patients are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reasons, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Treatment will be administered on an inpatient basis. We will compare the experimental treatment with baricitinib plus the institutional standard of care compared with the standard of care alone. During the phase I, we will define the dose-limiting toxicity of baricitinib and the dose to be used in the phase 2 part of the study. The starting baricitinib dose will be an oral tablet 4 mg-once daily which can be reduced to 2 mg depending on the observed toxicity. The minimum duration of therapy will be 5 days and it can be extended to 7 days. The standard of care will include the following therapies. Antibiotics will be individualized based on clinical suspicion, including the management of febrile neutropenia. Prophylaxis of thromboembolic disease will be administered to all participants. Remdesivir administration will be considered only in patients with severe pneumonia (SatO(2) <94%) with less than 7 days of onset of symptoms and with supplemental oxygen requirements but not using high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In the randomized phase, tocilizumab or interferon will not be allowed in the experimental arm. Tocilizumab can be used in patients in the standard of care arm at the discretion of the investigator. If it is prescribed it will be used according to the following criteria: patients who, according to his baseline clinical condition, would be an ICU tributary, interstitial pneumonia with severe respiratory failure, patients who are not on mechanical ventilation or ECMO and who are still progressing with corticoid treatment or if they are not candidates for corticosteroids. Mild ARDS (PAFI <300 mmHg) with radiological or blood gases deterioration that meets at least one of the following criteria: CRP >100mg/L D-Dimer >1,000g/L LDH >400U/L Ferritin >700ng/ml Interleukin 6 40ng/L. The use of tocilizumab is not recommended if there are AST/ALT values greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, neutrophils <500 cells/mm3, sepsis due to other pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, presence of comorbidity that can lead to a poor prognosis, complicated diverticulitis or intestinal perforation, ongoing skin infection. The dose will be that recommended by the Spanish Medicine Agency in patients 75Kg: 600mg dose whereas in patients <75kg: 400mg dose. Exceptionally, a second infusion can be assessed 12 hours after the first in those patients who experience a worsening of laboratory parameters after a first favourable response. The use of corticosteroids will be recommended in patients who have had symptoms for more than 7 days and who meet all the following criteria: need for oxygen support, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory failure or rapid deterioration of gas exchange, appearance or worsening of bilateral alveolar-interstitial infiltrates at the radiological level. In case of indication, it is recommended: dexamethasone 6mg/d p.o. or iv for 10 days or methylprednisolone 32mg/d orally or 30mg iv for 10 days or prednisone 40mg day p.o. for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: Phase 1 part: to describe the toxicity profile of baricitinib in COVID19 oncological patients during the 5-7 day treatment period and until day +14 or discharge (whichever it comes first). Phase 2 part: to describe the number of patients in the experimental arm that will not require mechanical oxygen support compared to the standard of care arm until day +14 or discharge (whichever it comes first). RANDOMISATION: For the phase 2 of the study, the allocation ratio will be 1:1. Randomization process will be carried out electronically through the REDcap platform (https://www.project-redcap.org/) BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open label study. No blinding will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The first part of the study (safety run-in cohort) will consist in the enrollment of 6 to 12 patients. In this population, we will test the toxicity of the experimental treatment. An incidence of severe adverse events grade 3-4 (graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5.0) inferior than 33% will be considered sufficient to follow with the next part of the study. The second part of the study we will perform an interim analysis of efficacy at first 64 assessed patients and a definitive one will analyze 128 assessed patients. Interim and definitive tests will be performed considering in both cases an alpha error of 0.05. We consider for the control arm this rate is expected to be 0.60 and for the experimental arm of 0.80. Considering this data, a superiority test to prove a difference of 0.20 with an overall alpha error of 0.10 and a beta error of 0.2 will be performed. Considering a 5% of dropout rate, it is expected that a total of 136 patients, 68 for each study arm, will be required to complete study accrual.

Cardiovascular complications, along with the levels of cTnI, creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) in hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were extracted. The pooled incidences of the extracted data were calculated, and the unadjusted cTnI level was compared between the surviving and expired patients. RESULTS Out of 1094 obtained records, 22 studies on a total of 4,157 patients were included. The pooled incidence rate of arrhythmia was 10.11%. Furthermore, myocardial injury had a pooled incidence of 17.85%, and finally, the pooled incidence for heart failure was 22.34%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS The investigation included 36 patients with primary operable esophageal cancer who were treated neoadjuvantly with cisplatin and fluorouracil. The TP53 genotype was assessed from paraffin-embedded diagnostic tumor biopsies using a standardized gene-specific TP53 sequencing protocol (mark53 kit; mark53 Ltd, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS Mutations in the TP53 gene were present in 50% of tumors. Two-year overall survival rates were 55.6% in patients with a normal TP53 marker status, compared with 16.7% in those with a mutant TP53 gene. In patients with normal TP53, neoadjuvant treatment resulted in significant advantages in terms of tumor-associated survival (P=.0049) and overall survival (P=.0304) compared with those with mutant TP53. The median tumor-associated survival was 34.2 months for patients with normal TP53, compared with 8.9 months for those with mutant TP53. The latter had a 3-fold higher risk of dying (hazard ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.359-6.86). CONCLUSIONS The biomarker TP53 divides esophageal cancer patients into 2 categories with markedly different outcomes: patients with a normal TP53 marker status may experience notable benefits from neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/fluorouracil, whereas those with a mutant TP53 marker status appear to be at risk for lack of response.","output":"The biomarker TP53 divides patients with neoadjuvantly treated esophageal cancer into 2 subgroups with markedly different outcomes.

The genomics of SARS-CoV-2 has been instrumental to the timely development of diagnostics and vaccines and in elucidating transmission dynamics. Global disease control programmes, including those for tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, foodborne pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance, also recommend genomics-based surveillance as an integral strategy towards control and elimination of these diseases. Despite the potential benefits, capacity remains low for many public health programmes in Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to reassess and strengthen surveillance systems and potentially integrate emerging technologies for preparedness of future epidemics and control of endemic diseases. We discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating pathogen genomics into public health surveillance systems in Africa. Improving accessibility through the creation of functional continent-wide networks, building multipathogen sequencing cores, training a critical mass of local experts, development of standards and policies to facilitate best practices for data sharing, and establishing a community of practice of genomics experts are all needed to use genomics for improved disease surveillance in Africa. Coordination and leadership are also crucial, which the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention seeks to provide through its institute for pathogen genomics.","output":"Genomic-informed pathogen surveillance in Africa: opportunities and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly disrupted household food purchasing and preparation, including elements identified as important drivers of household food waste. The two main aims of this study were (1) to examine changes in food waste behaviors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and Italy; and (2) to investigate potential predictors of food waste behavior, including avoidance of supermarkets, increased home cooking, and increased role of health concerns in food choices. A sample of n = 478 (79% female) individuals from the U.S., mean (SD) age = 30.51 (10.85), and n = 476 individuals from Italy, (78% female), mean (SD) age = 33.84 (12.86), completed an online survey between April 8th and April 28th 2020. Just under half of respondents (49%) reported decreased food waste since the start of the pandemic. Rates were significantly higher among the U.S. sample (61.5%, n = 294) compared to the Italian sample (38%, n = 180). Controlling for the time since restrictions were introduced, age, gender, and perceived financial security, logistic regression revealed greater reduction in food waste since the beginning of the pandemic for U.S. individuals relative to participants from Italy (OR = 0.47, p < .001). In addition, increased importance of health concerns when making food choices (OR = 1.34, p < .005) as well as more frequent cooking (OR = 1.35, p < .001), and greater avoidance of supermarkets (OR = 1.15, p = .049) were associated with greater probability of less food waste. Scarcity and greater reliance on cooking may encourage individuals to reflect on food waste practices.

Tfh1 sub-population was recently identified and associated with severity in infection and autoimmune diseases. The cellular and molecular requirements to induce human Tfh1 differentiation are unknown. Our work investigated the role of human dendritic cells (DC) in promoting Tfh1 differentiation and their physiopathological implication in mycobacterium tuberculosis and mild COVID-19 infection. Activated human blood CD1c+ DC were cocultured with allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing was then used alongside protein validation to define the induced Tfh lineage. DC signature and correlation with Tfh1 cells in infected patients was established through bioinformatic analysis. Our results show that GM-CSF-activated DC drove the differentiation of Tfh1 cells, displaying typical Tfh molecular features, including 1) high levels of PD-1, CXCR5, and ICOS expression; 2) BCL6 and TBET co-expression; 3) IL-21 and IFN- secretion. Mechanistically, GM-CSF triggered the emergence of two distinct DC sub-populations defined by their differential expression of CD40 and ICOS-ligand (ICOS-L), and distinct phenotype, morphology, transcriptomic signature, and function. We showed that Tfh1 differentiation was efficiently and specifically induced by CD40highICOS-Llow DC in a CD40-dependent manner. Tfh1 cells were positively associated with a CD40highICOS-LLow DC signature in patients with latent mycobacterium tuberculosis and mild COVID-19 infection. Our study uncovers a novel CD40-dependent human Tfh1 axis. Immunotherapy modulation of Tfh1 activity might contribute to control diseases where Tfh1 are known to play a key role, such as infections. Significance Statement Dendritic cells (DC) play a central role in triggering the adaptive immune response due to their T cell priming functions. Among different T cell subsets, it is still not clear how human type1 T follicular helper cells (Tfh1) differentiate. Tfh1 cells are implicated in several physiopathological conditions, including infections. Here we show that GM-CSF induces diversification of human DC. Only CD40highICOS-LLow DC were able to drive Tfh1 cell differentiation. We found that CD40highICOS-LLow DC signature was associated to Tfh1 cells in mycobacterium tuberculosis and COVID-19 patients. Our data reveal a previously undescribed pathway leading to human Tfh1 cell differentiation and highlight the importance of GM-CSF and CD40 as potential targets for the design of anti-infective therapies.","output":"GM-CSF-activated human dendritic cells promote type1 T follicular helper cells (Tfh1) polarization in a CD40-dependent manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The economic impact associated with the treatment strategies of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients by hospitals and health-care systems in Brazil is unknown and difficult to estimate This research describes the investments made to absorb the demand for treatment and the changes in occupation rates and billing in Brazilian hospitals","output":"The Economic Impact of COVID-19 Treatment at a Hospital-level: Investment and Financial Registers of Brazilian Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests that long-term pulmonary symptoms and functional impairment occurs in a proportion of individuals following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the proportion of affected patients remains to be determined, physicians are increasingly being confronted with patients reporting respiratory symptoms and impairment beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. In face of limited evidence, the Swiss Society for Pulmonology established a working group to address this area of unmet need and formulated diagnostic and treatment recommendations for the care of patients with pulmonary long COVID (LC). METHOD: The Swiss COVID Lung Study group and Swiss Society for Pulmonology (SSP) formulated 13 questions addressing the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary LC. A survey within the SSP special interest groups involved in care of LC patients was conducted in Switzerland. A CORE process/Delphi-like process was used to formulate recommendations. Forty experienced pulmonologists replied to the first survey and 22 completed the second follow-up survey. Agreement of 70% consensus led to formulation of a recommendation. RESULTS: The participants in the survey reached consensus and formulated a strong recommendation for regarding the following points. Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 should have a pulmonary assessment including pulmonary function tests. Symptomatic subjects affected by COVID-19, including those with mild disease, should benefit from a pulmonary follow-up. Persistent respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 should be investigated by a pulmonary follow-up including plethysmography, diffusion capacity measurement, and blood gases analysis. Individuals having suffered from COVID-19 and who present with persistent respiratory symptoms should be offered a rehabilitation. Additional questions were given moderate or weak recommendations for. The panel did not reach sufficient consensus for pharmacological therapy (e.g., therapy specifically targeting lung fibrosis) to formulate recommendations for LC drug treatment. CONCLUSION: The formulated recommendations should serve as an interim guidance to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary LC. As new evidence emerges, these recommendations may need to be adapted.","output":"Swiss Recommendations for the Follow-Up and Treatment of Pulmonary Long COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe/critical cases account for 18C20% of all novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, but their mortality rate can be up to 61.5%. Furthermore, all deceased patients were severe/critical cases. The main reasons for the high mortality of severe/critical patients are advanced age (>60 years old) and combined underlying diseases. Elderly patients with comorbidities show decreased organ function and low compensation for damage such as hypoxia and inflammation, which accelerates disease progression. The lung is the main target organ attacked by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) while immune organs, liver, blood vessels and other organs are damaged to varying degrees. Liver volume is increased, and mild active inflammation and focal necrosis are observed in the portal area. Virus particles have also been detected in liver cells. Therefore, multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) and individualized treatment plans, accurate prediction of disease progression and timely interventions are vital to effectively reduce mortality. Specifically, a multidisciplinary three-dimensional management, individualized comprehensive plan should be implemented. The treatment plan complies with three principles, namely, multidisciplinary management of patients, individualized diagnosis and treatment plans, and timely monitoring and intervention of disease. MDT members are mainly physicians from critical medicine, infection and respiratory disciplines, but also include cardiovascular, kidney, endocrine, digestion, nerve, nutrition, rehabilitation, psychology and specialty care. According to a patients specific disease condition, an individualized diagnosis and treatment plan is formulated (one plan for one patient). While selecting individualized antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatment, we also strengthen nutritional support, psychological intervention, comprehensive rehabilitation and timely and full-course intervention to develop overall and special nursing plans. In response to the rapid progression of severe/critical patients, MDT members need to establish a three-dimensional management model with close observation and timely evaluation. The MDT should make rounds of the quarantine wards both morning and night, and of critical patient wards nightly, to implement round-the-clock rounds management, to accurately predict disease progression, perform the quick intervention and prevent rapid deterioration of the patient. Our MDT has cumulatively treated 77 severe/critical COVID-19 cases, including 62 (80.5%) severe cases and 15 (19.5%) critical cases, with an average age of 63.8 years. Fifty-three (68.8%) cases presented with more than one underlying disease and 65 (84.4%) severe cases recovered from COVID-19. The average hospital stay of severe/critical cases was 22 days, and the mortality rate was 2.6%, both of which were significantly lower than the 30C40 days and 49.0C61.5%, respectively, reported in the literature. Therefore, a multidisciplinary, three-dimensional and individualized comprehensive treatment plan can effectively reduce the mortality rate of severe/critical COVID-19 and improve the cure rate.","output":"Multidisciplinary, three-dimensional and individualized comprehensive treatment for severe/critical COVID-19()()()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted new interest among anesthesiologists and intensivists in controlling coughing and expectoration of potentially infectious aerosolized secretions during intubation and extubation.

This fear may be alleviated with clear understanding of the mechanisms and effective management of post-extubation airway obstruction including laryngospasm. We review the dynamic function of the larynx from the vantage point of head-and-neck surgery, highlighting two key concepts: 1. The larynx is a complex organ that may occlude reflexively at levels other than the true vocal folds; 2. The widely held belief that positive-pressure ventilation by mask can break laryngospasm is not supported by the otorhinolaryngology literature. We review the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction after extubation, discuss techniques for achieving smooth extubation with avoidance of coughing and expectoration of secretions, and recommend, on the basis of this review, a clinical pathway for optimal management of upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm to avoid adverse outcomes.","output":"Extubation and the Risks of Coughing and Laryngospasm in the Era of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Publisher Correction: A human monoclonal antibody blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cardiac point of care ultrasound (cPOCUS) is becoming an important skill for residents. This study explores the feasibility and efficacy of a novel online and simulation-based curriculum for cPOCUS training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Between January 20th and August 1st, 2021, Internal Medicine PGY-1s were block randomized in a 1:1 fashion to intervention and control arms based on prior cPOCUS experience. All participants were asked to interpret a standard, preselected set of echocardiographic images. After this testing, the intervention arm underwent an in-person, simulation-based teaching experience followed by a structured, online curriculum. Both study arms were given the same test again after completion of this curriculum. Test results were graded by two blinded reviewers (board certified in echocardiography) using a standardized rubric, creating a score of 0-16 [16 being the highest]. A subjective, dichotomous scope of practice score was created to evaluate interpretation appropriateness. The primary outcome was improvement in interpretation score. One-tailed Mann-Whitney and Fischer's exact were performed as appropriate (GraphPad Prism version 9.2.0). Results: A total of twenty-four participants were enrolled, twelve in each arm. Two participants in the intervention arm did not complete baseline testing and were excluded from the analysis. One PGY-1 in each arm had prior cPOCUS training. Baseline median interpretation scores were 9.1 in the intervention arm and 9.5 in the control arm (p=0.9). The median increase in echo interpretation score was 3.3 in the intervention arm vs. 1.1 in the control arm (p=0.11). Interpretation scores improved in 90% of the intervention arm and 67% in the control arm (p=0.21). Interpretation quality stayed within the scope of practice for 80% of participants in the intervention arm vs. 42% in the control arm (p=0.08) on post-testing.

PATIENT AND METHODS We analysed the first 23 consecutive patients who underwent RASP using our 360 reconstruction between December 2015 and October 2017. After transperitoneal intravesical adenoma enucleation, a circumferential 360 reconstruction is performed. The first suture is placed at the 9 o'clock position and the edge of the urethra and bladder mucosa is approximated using 2-0 barbed suture. The reconstruction is continued counter-clockwise and the bladder mucosa is approximated to the urethra circumferentially. RESULTS The mean (sd) operating time was 160.6 (28.1) min and the estimated blood loss was 98.6 (99.8) mL. No patients required conversion to open surgery. No intra-operative or postoperative transfusions were needed. No intra-operative complications occurred. The mean (sd) length of hospital stay was 2.1 (0.6) days. One postoperative complication was reported (respiratory distress in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, requiring intensive care unit admission). CONCLUSION Our 360 reconstruction during RASP is feasible and safe. The aim of the technique is to minimize use of electrocautery and decrease the raw surface area on the prostate capsule. This technical modification could potentially lessen postoperative bleeding after RASP and therefore the need for continuous bladder irrigation. In addition, it could potentially lead to mitigation of burning and irritative postoperative symptoms. Longer follow-up and comparative studies of different RASP techniques are still needed.","output":"Transvesical robot-assisted simple prostatectomy with 360 circumferential reconstruction: step-by-step technique."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cities, due to population density and the complexity of human interactions, experience specific problems arising from their functioning in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many scientists who publish their findings in contemporary literature agree on the need to shape pandemic resilient cities by making changes to the functional-spatial structure and preparing cities for rapid revitalization [regeneration] in the post-pandemic period. The main objective of the research is to identify the most important problems regarding service infrastructure deficiencies in the nine medium-sized Polish cities selected for research located in the Warsaw agglomeration, which are well connected with Warsaw. The research was based on: analysis of selected GIS spatial data, demographic data from the Polish Central Statistical Office, surveys among residents, on their needs during pandemic constraints. The focus was on three important aspects of development in the era of the pandemic: access to first-need services, access to greenery and active recreation areas, accessibility and transport efficiency problems. The research revealed changes in the way people travel and do their essential shopping, inadequate cycling infrastructure and problems with the availability of essential services close to where they live. The research programme varies, although the diagnosis and the possibility of transforming the functional-spatial structure of the cities studied as typical medium-sized cities in the impact zone of a large centre dominate. The conclusions provide examples of proposals for tactical urbanism planning solutions that could rapidly improve the quality of residence in a low-budget way.

We expand a mathematical model of VL transmission based on the KalaNet trial and incorporate the use of ITNs explicitly into the model. One of the major contributions of this work is that we calibrate the model based on the available epidemiological data, generally independent of the KalaNet trial. We validate the model on data collected during the KalaNet trial. We conclude that in order to eliminate VL, the ITN usage would have to stay above 96%. This is higher than the 91% ITNs use at the end of the trial which may explain why the trial did not show a positive effect from ITNs.

In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and recommended avoidance measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites, and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in overconcern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effects of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals' perceptions and motivations. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling. The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multigroup analysis. RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals' threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=.002) and self-efficacy (P=.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention, while response cost (P<.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=.003) and information overload (P=.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals.

(ii) IgG sensitivity good if point estimate was 90.0%, acceptable if 85.0%, otherwise not acceptable. (iii) User-friendliness not acceptable if complicated to perform or difficult to read result, otherwise good. We also included partial evaluations of three automated immunoassay systems. Results Sensitivity and specificity varied considerably; IgG specificity between 90.9% (85.9-94.2) and 100% (97.7-100.0), and IgG sensitivity between 53.8% (41.9-65.4) and 98.5% (91.0-100.0). Combining our evaluation criteria, none of the 28 rapid tests that detected IgG had an overall performance considered good, seven tests were considered acceptable, while 21 tests were considered not acceptable. Four tests detected only total antibodies and were not given an overall evaluation. IgG sensitivity and/or specificity of the automated immunoassays did not exceed that of many rapid tests. Conclusion When prevalence is low, the most important analytical property is a tests IgG specificity, which must be high to minimize false positive results. Out of 32 rapid tests, none had a performance classified as good, but seven were classified as acceptable.","output":"Evaluation of 32 rapid tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on syphilis rates is unknown.

We assessed the association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality among inpatients with COVID-19 and explored reasons for discrepancies in the literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included adult hypertensive patients from a prospective nationwide cohort of 3512 inpatients with COVID-19 up to June 30, 2020. Cox proportional hazard models with various adjustment or propensity weighting methods were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of 30-day mortality for chronic users versus non-users of RAAS blockers. We analyzed data of 1160 hypertensive patients: 719 (62%) were male and 777 (67%) were older than 65 years. The main comorbidities were diabetes (n = 416, 36%), chronic cardiac disease (n = 401, 35%), and obesity (n = 340, 29%); 705 (61%) received oxygen therapy. We recorded 135 (11.6%) deaths within 30 days of diagnosis. We found no association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality (unadjusted HR = 1.13, 95% CI [0.8-1.6]; propensity inverse probability treatment weighted HR = 1.09 [0.86-1.39]; propensity standardized mortality ratio weighted HR = 1.08 [0.79-1.47]). Our comprehensive review of previous studies highlighted that significant associations were mostly found in unrestricted populations with inappropriate adjustment, or with biased in-hospital exposure measurement. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support previous concerns regarding these drugs, nor a potential protective effect as reported in previous poorly designed studies and meta-analyses. RAAS blockers should not be discontinued during the pandemic, while in-hospital management of these drugs will be clarified by randomized trials.

But this understanding is being threatened by a number of developments. Frustration about the lack of nuclear disarmament and concerns about humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons led to the negotiation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). The new treaty has further exposed existing fault lines within the NPT and exacerbated unresolved conflicts over the proper approach to disarmament and the weighting of the NPT pillars. Currently, disagreements over the compatibility of the two treaties and the approach to the TPNW in particular divide the membership of the NPT. At the same time, real proliferation cases test the regimes ability to act, as norm enforcement is regularly hampered by interference from the great powers. These developmentsthe absence of genuine disarmament, disputes among NPT members, competition between the TPNW and the NPT, and actual nuclear proliferationare part of a comprehensive crisis and destabilization of the non-proliferation regime. We argue that three developments are necessary to restabilize the regime: a cooperative resolution of the power struggles among the major powers; a depolarization of the inter-group divisions in the NPT; and a return to the principle of nuclear war prevention as a common maxim for action.","output":"The global nuclear order and the crisis of the nuclear non-proliferation regime: Taking stock and moving forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to compare physical activity (PA) levels before and during a pandemic lockdown among adolescent Polish youths in relation to meeting the World Health Organizations (WHO) recommendations of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and identify potential environmental factors that may affect these levels. An online survey tool that included validated measures of adolescents MVPA and socio-environmental, potential confounders was administered to youths (e.g., lack of classmates, motivation, possibility of choosing any physical exercise time, possibility of choosing your own exercises, home environment). The analytic sample comprised 127 adolescents aged 15.4  0.5 years on average (52% girls and 48% boys). The results highlight that among adolescents who did not meet the WHO MVPA recommendations before the lockdown, 13.4% had an increased frequency of PA (from 2.9 to 5.4 day/week) (p = 0.01) during the lockdown. In the group who did meet these recommendations before the lockdown, 50% significantly decreased their level of MVPA below the WHOs recommendations (p = 0.01). Self-rated health for PA showed a significantly strong correlation with MVPA in the group of students who met the WHO recommendations before the pandemic (r = 0.76; p < 0.05) but failed to maintain that recommendation during the COVID-19 restriction.

Changes in the underlying immune mechanisms determine patient prognosis. This study aimed to analyze the role of lymphocyte subsets in the immunopathogenesisof COVID-19 and severe influenza A, and examined the clinical significance of their alterations in the prognosis and recovery duration. METHODS: By retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at different time points (weeks 1-4). RESULTS: We reviewed the patients' data of 94 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe-COVID-19, 19 Severe-COVID-19 and 37 severe influenza A.

The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain. METHODS: In a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results. RESULTS: We enrolled 1368 consecutive patients (median age 68 [interquartile range, IQR 53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3822 tests (median 2 [IQR 1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1368), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. CONCLUSIONS: In patients admitted to hospital, a single combined nasal and throat swab with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 has excellent specificity, but limited diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.

PLWHA are unique due to their altered immune system from their history of chronic HIV infection and their use of antiretroviral therapy, some of which have been used experimentally to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the epidemiology of SARS-COV-2/HIV coinfection and estimate associated mortality from COVID-19 (Prospero Registration ID: CRD42020187980). PubMed, SCOPUS, OVID and Cochrane Library databases, and medRxiv preprint repositories were searched from January 1, 2020, to December 12, 2020. Data were extracted from studies reporting COVID-19 attack and mortality rates in PLWHA compared to their HIV-negative counterparts. Pooled attack and mortality risks were quantified using random-effects models. We identified 22 studies that included 20,982,498 participants across North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The median age was 56 years, and 50% were male. HIV-positive persons had a significantly higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.46)] and mortality from COVID-19 (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.21-2.60) than HIV-negative individuals. The beneficial effects of tenofovir and protease-inhibitors in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from COVID-19 in PLWHA remain inconclusive. HIV remains a significant risk factor for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19.

To this end, we compared the Rapid Diagnostic Kit of Canine Parvovirus, Coronavirus and Rotavirus antigen (Quicking(?)) to PCR, which is considered as the most reliable diagnostic method. A total of 78 duplicated faecal samples were collected from diarrhoeic dogs. Vaccination history within a month prior to the onset of diarrhoea was reported for 12 of the sampled dogs. The rapid diagnostic test was performed in 23 of the faecal samples directly, while the rest were placed into a sterile cotton tipped swab suitable for collection and transportation of viruses (Sigma -VCM(?)) and stored at ?20 C. The sensitivity of the Quicking rapid diagnostic test compared to PCR in the total number of samples, in samples from non-vaccinated dogs and in samples tested directly after collection were 22.22% (95% CI: 13.27C33.57%), 26.67% (95% CI: 16.08C39.66%) and 76.47% (95% CI: 50.10C93.04%) respectively, while the specificity of the test was 100% in any case.

It appears that lipid-lowering pharmacological interventions, in particular statins, might reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications caused by COVID-19 and might potentially have an additional antiviral activity. It has been shown that high cholesterol levels are associated with more lipid rafts, subdomains of the plasma membrane that can harbour angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of the importance of cholesterol for viral entry into host cells could suggest a role for cholesterol-lowering therapies in reducing viral infectivity. In addition to their lipid-lowering and plaque-stabilisation effects, statins possess pleiotropic effects including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antithrombotic activities. Lower rates of mortality and intubation have been reported in studies investigating statin therapy in influenza infection, and statin therapy was shown to increase viral clearance from the blood during chronic hepatitis C infection. Statins may also serve as potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors, thereby contributing to the control of viral infection.

Preventive measures to avoid infections are therefore particularly important for individuals engaging in behavioral risk factors. We seek to determine whether behavioral risk factors (BRFs) play a significant role in the adherence to preventive COVID-19 measures in a population aged 50 and above. The SHARE wave 8 (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) and SHARE COVID-19 Survey served as the database, resulting in an analytical sample of 17,588 respondents from 23 European countries plus Israel. Of these 36.04% engaged in at least one BRF and 16.68% engaged in 3 or more BRFs. Multilevel logistic regressions revealed that engagement in one BRF was significantly associated with less adherence to hygiene preventive measures, i.e., hand-sanitizing, hand-washing and covering coughs and sneezes (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78; 0.94), as was engagement in two BRFs (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74; 0.97) and three or more BRFs (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59; 0.88). No such association was found between engagement in BRFs and adherences to social isolation preventive measures, i.e., avoiding meeting more than five people, visiting others or going shopping, or regulated preventive measures, i.e., wearing a mask and keeping physical distance.

Monitoring of oxygen saturations (SpO2) is therefore an increasingly common part of community-based care, with the aim of improving the identification of adults who are deteriorating. We set out to investigate whether rigid SpO2 triggers, or absolute change in SpO2, is more indicative of deterioration in COVID-19. Methods A prospective, uncontrolled, open-label study in a large UK general practice was conducted between May and November 2020. Participants recorded twice daily oximetry and symptom diary for 14 days after test-confirmed COVID-19. Primary outcomes were the proportion of people whose SpO2 dropped to [] 94% and []92%, the average maximum reduction in SpO2, and admission to hospital. We also investigated the relationship between MRC Dyspnoea scale, modified Roth score, and SpO2 through correlation analyses. Results 52 participants were recruited, following which 41 participants completed the study. The average age was 45.9 years with 63.4% identifying as female. The mean maximum reduction in SpO2 was 2.8%. The average time to maximum reduction in SpO2 was 6.4 days. Nine participants (22.0%) had a reduction in SpO2 to []94%. Three of these had a reduction in SpO2 to []92%, for which all three were admitted to hospital. Modified Roth score and SpO2 were weakly positively correlated (.31). MRC dyspnoea scale score and SpO2 were moderately negatively correlated (-.53). Conclusions A reduction in SpO2 to []92% was found to be highly predictive for admission to hospital. Modified Roth score or MRC dyspnoea scale scores should not be used as proxy measures for oximetry.

Data on SARS-CoV-2 burden, transmission, and asymptomatic infections from Africa are scarce. We aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 burden and transmission in one rural and one urban community in South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of households in Agincourt, Mpumalanga province (rural site) and Klerksdorp, North West province (urban site) from July, 2020 to August, 2021. We randomly selected households for the rural site from a health and sociodemographic surveillance system and for the urban site using GPS coordinates. Households with more than two members and where at least 75% of members consented to participate were eligible. Midturbinate nasal swabs were collected twice a week from household members irrespective of symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). Serum was collected every 2 months and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Main outcomes were the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, frequency of reinfection, symptomatic fraction (percent of infected individuals with 1 symptom), the duration of viral RNA shedding (number of days of SARS-CoV-2 RT-rtPCR positivity), and the household cumulative infection risk (HCIR; number of infected household contacts divided by the number of susceptible household members). FINDINGS: 222 households (114 at the rural site and 108 at the urban site), and 1200 household members (643 at the rural site and 557 at the urban site) were included in the analysis. For 115 759 nasal specimens from 1200 household members (follow-up 925%), 1976 (17%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive on RT-rtPCR. By RT-rtPCR and serology combined, 749 of 1200 individuals (624% [95% CI 581C664]) had at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection episode, and 87 of 749 (116% [94C142]) were reinfected. The mean infection episode duration was 116 days (SD 90; range 4C137). Of 662 RT-rtPCR-confirmed episodes (>14 days after the start of follow-up) with available data, 97 (147% [119C179]) were symptomatic with at least one symptom (in individuals aged <19 years, 28 [75%] of 373 episodes symptomatic; in individuals aged 19 years, 69 [239%] of 289 episodes symptomatic). Among 222 households, 200 (901% [853C937]) had at least one SARS-CoV-2-positive individual on RT-rtPCR or serology. HCIR overall was 239% (195 of 817 susceptible household members infected [95% CI 198C284]). HCIR was 233% (20 of 86) for symptomatic index cases and 239% (175 of 731) for asymptomatic index cases (univariate odds ratio [OR] 10 [95% CI 05C20]). On multivariable analysis, accounting for age and sex, low minimum cycle threshold value (30 vs >30) of the index case (OR 53 [23C124]) and beta and delta variant infection (vs Wuhan-Hu-1, OR 33 [14C82] and 104 [41C267], respectively) were associated with increased HCIR. People living with HIV who were not virally supressed (400 viral load copies per mL) were more likely to develop symptomatic illness when infected with SAR-CoV-2 (OR 33 [13C84]), and shed SARS-CoV-2 for longer (hazard ratio 04 [95% CI 03C06]) compared with HIV-uninfected individuals. INTERPRETATION: In this study, 565 (853%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic and index case symptom status did not affect HCIR, suggesting a limited role for control measures targeting symptomatic individuals. Increased household transmission of beta and delta variants was likely to have contributed to successive waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with more than 60% of individuals infected by the end of follow-up.

Here we ask in a rodent model of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) whether improvements to metabolic health are realized in women having received surgical menopause. Specifically we were interested in knowing whether rats made menopausal through surgical means would exhibit persistent hepatic steatosis as reported in previously pregnant, freely cycling female VSG rats or if it is resolved as reported in male VSG rats. METHODS All the rats first received ovariectomy (OVX) and then were placed on high-fat diet before either sham or VSG surgery (N = 12, 9) and then were monitored for resolution of obesity-related comorbidities. RESULTS VSG was sufficient to reduce weight and adiposity in OVX females in comparison to obese rats (P < 0.001). Glucose tolerance (P < 0.05) was improved in OVX-VSG females with no change in insulin sensitivity. Both circulating (P < 0.01) and hepatic triglyceride (P < 0.01) levels were also reduced after VSG. Liver integrity was improved in OVX-VSG in comparison to OVX-obese as reflected by reduced aspartate aminotransferase levels (P < 0.05). The ability of mitochondria to generate adenosine triphosphate was maintained, and an increase in complex IV may decrease the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, VSG in OVX rats experience many positive benefits including the resolution of hepatic steatosis that persists in reproductively intact female rats after VSG.","output":"Vertical sleeve gastrectomy improves indices of metabolic disease in rodent model of surgical menopause."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses have affected the world for over a century, causing multiple pandemics.

Participant progress and exercise were monitored remotely, with exercise regimens altered as required. Participants and clinicians could communicate remotely via the device. RESULTS: The median range of motion during the first week post-surgery was 63 (interquartile range [IQR] = 21) and increased to 136 (IQR = 16) by week 7. The rate of participant compliance with exercises using the device was 32.3% for thrice-daily compliance and 52.4% for once-daily compliance. The 2-way communication channel was well utilized by both participants and clinicians. We report a 35.7% reduction in face-to-face physiotherapy appointments compared with standard practice. Finally, >80% of users who completed the feedback questionnaire reported a positive experience using the device, finding it easy to understand and reporting that it motivated them to perform their exercises.

Thus investigation is warranted for a deeper understanding of the potential impact of the indoor microbial communities. Among these environments, the biological laboratories stand out because they are relatively clean and yet are highly susceptible to microbial contaminants. In this study, we assessed the microbial compositions of samples from the surfaces of various sites across different types of biological laboratories. We have qualitatively and quantitatively assessed these possible microbial contaminants, and found distinct differences in their microbial community composition. We also found that the type of laboratories has a larger influence than the sampling site in shaping the microbial community, in terms of both structure and richness. On the other hand, the public areas of the different types of laboratories share very similar sets of microbes. Tracing the main sources of these microbes, we identified both environmental and human factors that are important factors in shaping the diversity and dynamics of these possible microbial contaminations in biological laboratories. These possible microbial contaminants that we have identified will be helpful for people who aim to eliminate them from samples.

A large part of their success can be attributed to the induction of central immunotolerance including B- and T-cells upon fetal infection leading to the generation of persistently infected (PI) animals. In the past few years, it became evident that evasion of innate immunity is a central element to induce and maintain persistent infection. Hence, the viral non-structural protease Npro heads the transcription factor IRF-3 for proteasomal degradation, whereas an extracellularly secreted, soluble form of the envelope glycoprotein Erns degrades immunostimulatory viral single- and double-stranded RNA, which makes this RNase unique among viral endoribonucleases. We propose that these pestiviral interferon (IFN) antagonists maintain a state of innate immunotolerance mainly pertaining its viral nucleic acids, in contrast to the well-established immunotolerance of the adaptive immune system, which is mainly targeted at proteins. In particular, the unique extension of self to include the viral genome by degrading immunostimulatory viral RNA by Erns is reminiscent of various host nucleases that are important to prevent inappropriate IFN activation by the hosts own nucleic acids in autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Goutires syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. This mechanism of innate tolerance might thus provide a new facet to the role of extracellular RNases in the sustained prevention of the bodys own immunostimulatory RNA to act as a danger-associated molecular pattern that is relevant across various species.","output":"What can pestiviral endonucleases teach us about innate immunotolerance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 34 papers.

In the case of zoonoses emerging from livestock, one of the most significant changes that has taken place since the mid twentieth century is what has been termed the livestock revolution, whereby the stock of food animals, their productivity and their trade has increased rapidly to feed rising and increasingly wealthy and urbanized populations. Further increases are projected in the future in low and middle-income countries. Using avian influenza as an example, we discuss how the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 in China was linked to rapid intensification of the poultry sector taking place in landscapes rich in wetland agriculture and wild waterfowls habitats, providing an extensive interface with the wild reservoir of avian influenza viruses. Trade networks and live-poultry markets further exacerbated the spread and persistence of avian influenza as well as human exposure. However, as the history of emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) demonstrates in high-income countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, this is by no way specific to low and middle-income countries. Many HPAI emergence events took place in countries with generally good biosecurity standards, and the majority of these in regions hosting intensive poultry production systems. Emerging zoonoses are only one of a number of externalities of intensive livestock production systems, alongside antimicrobial consumption, disruption of nutrient cycles and greenhouse gases emissions, with direct or indirect impacts on human health. In parallel, livestock production is essential to nutrition and livelihoods in many low-income countries.

Carvacrol (CV) is a common natural compound in essential oils and extracts of medicinal plants with potent in vivo and in vitro bioactivities. The work was extended to achieve the target of investigation of the protective potentialities of CV and its nanoemulsion as a cytoprotective drug against Cisp-induced nephrotoxicity in albino rats. CV-nanoemulsion was prepared by a hydrophilic surfactant polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) and deionized water. The TEM image of the particle distribution prepared nanoemulsion is mainly spherical in shape with particle size varying between 14 and 30 nm. Additionally, the Cisp administration caused the increasing of the levels of urea and creatinine in the blood and serum. These increasing of urea and creatinine levels caused consequently the turbulence of the oxidative stress as well as the rising of hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF- levels in the serum. Also, histopathological changes of the kidney tissue were observed. These changes back to normal by treatment with CV-nanoemulsion. Expression levels of nephrotoxicity-related genes including LGALS3, VEGF, and CAV1 in kidney tissue using qRT-PCR were measured. The results revealed that the expression of LGALS3, VEGF and CAV1 genes was highly significantly increased in only Cisp treated group when compared with other treated groups. While, these genes expressions were significantly decreased in Cisp + CV treated group when compared with Cisp treated rats (P < 0.001). In addition, there were no significant differences between Cisp + nano-CV treated group and both negative control and nanoemulsion alone groups but it was not significant. In addition, the Western blot of protein analysis results showed that the LGALS3 and CAV1 are highly expressed only in Cisp + CV treated group compared with other groups. There was no significant difference between Cisp + nano-CV treated animals and negative control for both mRNA and protein expression. Based on these results, CV was combined with calcium alginate; a more stable capsule is formed, allowing for the formation of a double wall in the microcapsule. These results supported the therapeutic effect of CV and its nano-emulsion as cytoprotective agents against Cisp nephrotoxicity.","output":"Cytoprotective potentialities of carvacrol and its nanoemulsion against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats: development of nano-encasulation form"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In fact, the groundwater pollution caused by the acceleration of industrialization and rapid population growth is an important constraint to sustainable development. Taking L area as an example, this paper finds out the differences of groundwater vulnerability in this area and plans the groundwater vulnerability classification. For Chinas groundwater protection work, it is very important for the management departments at all levels in each L area to provide development technology support for enterprises. Based on the concept of groundwater quality vulnerability and groundwater vulnerability assessment method in Japan, according to the actual situation of the study area, this paper analyzes the vulnerability of natural geography, meteorology and hydrology, geological conditions, and human activities in the area. This paper establishes an optimized and improved DRASTIC model and adds the evaluation factors affecting human activities into the evaluation conditions of traditional DRASTIC model, that is, the current land use status and groundwater exploitation. By combining bee colony optimization with groundwater vulnerability assessment model, groundwater vulnerability assessment is carried out. This paper also uses the special computer system to simulate the decision-making process of medical staff, provides obesity intelligence diagnosis and personalized prescription exercise, carries out exercise weight loss monitoring for obese teenagers, helps teenagers to achieve healthy exercise and diet, and provides scientific guidance for fitness guidance of Chinese diet youth. The system adopts the methods of artificial intelligence and software development, diagnoses obesity through youth physique test, provides personalized exercise prescription through special system, monitors diet work in real time, and provides timely feedback.

When estimating the treatment effect, it is essential to appropriately adjust for selection bias due to observed confounders using, for example, propensity score weighting. Selection bias due to confounders occurs when individuals who are treated are substantially different from those who are untreated with respect to covariates that are also associated with the outcome. A comparison of the unadjusted, naive treatment effect estimate with the propensity score adjusted treatment effect estimate provides an estimate of the selection bias due to these observed confounders. In this article, we propose methods to identify the observed covariate that explains the largest proportion of the estimated selection bias. Identification of the most influential observed covariate or covariates is important in resource-sensitive settings where the number of covariates obtained from individuals needs to be minimized due to cost and/or patient burden and in settings where this covariate can provide actionable information to healthcare agencies, providers, and stakeholders. We propose straightforward parametric and nonparametric procedures to examine the role of observed covariates and quantify the proportion of the observed selection bias explained by each covariate. We demonstrate good finite sample performance of our proposed estimates using a simulation study and use our procedures to identify the most influential covariates that explain the observed selection bias in estimating the causal effect of alcohol use on progression of Huntington's disease, a rare neurological disease.","output":"Quantifying the bias due to observed individual confounders in causal treatment effect estimates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biosensors have potentially revolutionized the biomedical field.

This data formed the basis of a model of tobacco industry political activity known as the policy dystopia model (PDM). The PDM has been widely used in tobacco control research and advocacy and has subsequently been shown relevant to other unhealthy commodities industries in both HICs and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Before it can be validated as a generic tool for researching corporate influence on policy, one needs to determine whether the PDM successfully captures contemporary corporate political activities in LMICs. METHOD: We conducted semistructured interviews with 22 LMIC-based advocates and used the transcripts as the primary data source. The discursive and instrumental taxonomies constituting the PDM served as the starting point for the coding framework. Using thematic analysis, we combined deductive and inductive coding to ensure we captured all strategies from the PDM and the interviews. RESULTS: This study found that the tobacco industry uses a set of discursive and instrumental strategies that is largely consistent across LMICs and with the PDM. We identified several minor contextual nuances absent from the PDM. Some of these nuances were characteristic to individual countries, while others to LMICs more broadly. They included the argument that tobacco control policies unfairly punish reputable tobacco industry actors, and an emphasis on instrumental strategies centred around maintaining a good image, rather than rehabilitating a tarnished image as emphasised in the PDM. CONCLUSIONS: Allowing for the nuances identified in this study, the PDM has been found to be fit for purpose. The revised model should now be tested through in-depth LMIC case studies and could be used to facilitate comparative studies of unhealthy commodity industries political activities.","output":"Developing more detailed taxonomies of tobacco industry political activity in low-income and middle-income countries: qualitative evidence from eight countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large-scale manipulations on social media have two important characteristics: (i) use of propaganda to influence others, and (ii) adoption of coordinated behavior to spread it and to amplify its impact.

Then, we investigate the use of propaganda by different coordinated communities that participated in the online debate. The combination of the use of propaganda and coordinated behavior allows us to uncover the authenticity and harmfulness of the different communities. Finally, we compare our measures of propaganda and coordination with automation (i.e., bot) scores and Twitter suspensions, revealing interesting trends.

METHODS: In this study, we collected detailed information on the circumstances in which human-to-human transmission occurred in the tertiary transmission cases of COVID-19 in the community. RESULTS: On January 26, 2020, an imported case of COVID-19 was confirmed, and by February 10, 2020, one secondary transmission and three tertiary transmissions were identified. Secondary transmission occurred on the first day of illness of the infector, and his symptoms were suggestive of a common cold. The transmission occurred during a 90-minute long meal together in a restaurant. The people were sitting within one meter of each other, and had no direct contact. The tertiary transmission also occurred on the first-day illness of the other infector, and his only symptom was slight chills. The transmission occurred at a church during 2-hour-long worship, and two rows separated them.

Currently, tracheal aspirate (TA) serves as the gold standard collection modality in critically ill newborns, but this method remains invasive. We tested the hypothesis that glutathione status would positively correlate between EBC and TA collections in intubated newborns in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU). We also hypothesized that these measurements would be associated with alveolar macrophage (AM) glutathione status in the newborn lung. METHODS Reduced glutathione (rGSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and total GSH (rGSH + (2 X GSSG)) were measured in sequential EBC and TA samples from 26 intubated newborns via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Additionally, AM glutathione was evaluated via immunofluorescence. Pearson's correlation coefficient and associated 95% confidence intervals were used to quantify the associations between raw and urea-corrected concentrations in EBC and TA samples and AM staining. Statistical significance was defined as p  0.05 using two-tailed tests. The sample size was projected to allow for a correlation coefficient of 0.5, with 0.8 power and alpha of 0.05. RESULTS EBC was obtainable from intubated newborns without adverse clinical events. EBC samples demonstrated moderate to strong positive correlations with TA samples in terms of rGSH, GSSG and total GSH. Positive correlations between the two sampling sites were observed in both raw and urea-corrected concentrations of rGSH, GSSG and total GSH. AM glutathione staining moderately correlated with GSSG and total GSH status in both the TA and EBC. CONCLUSIONS GSH status in EBC samples of intubated newborns significantly correlated with the GSH status of the TA sample and was reflective of cellular GSH status in this cohort of neonatal patients. Non-invasive EBC sampling of intubated newborns holds promise for monitoring antioxidant status such as GSH in the premature lung.

Smoking has been reported as one of the factors that increases severity and mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. However, the effect of smoking on such medical outcomes is still controversial. This study conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) on the association between smoking and negative outcomes among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Google Scholar, were systematically searched from the initiation of the database until 12 December 2020. All relevant studies about smoking and COVID-19 were screened using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The NewcastleCOttawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of eligible articles. Random meta-analyses were conducted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot, Beggs test and Eggers test. RESULTS: A total of 1248 studies were retrieved and reviewed. A total of 40 studies were finally included for meta-analysis. Both current smoking and former smoking significantly increase the risk of disease severity (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.16C2.15, p=0.004; and OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.64C3.77, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity.

Hence, the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was developed with 4 versions according to the type of app (interactive or standalone) and according to the target user (patient or provider). Standalone MAUQ for patients comprises 3 subscales, which are ease of use, interface and satisfaction, and usefulness. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to translate and validate the English version of MAUQ (standalone for patients) into a Malay version of MAUQ (M-MAUQ) for mHealth app research and usage in future in Malaysia. METHODS: Forward and backward translation and harmonization of M-MAUQ were conducted by Malay native speakers who also spoke English as their second language. The process began with a forward translation by 2 independent translators followed by harmonization to produce an initial translated version of M-MAUQ. Next, the forward translation was continued by another 2 translators who had never seen the original MAUQ. Lastly, harmonization was conducted among the committee members to resolve any ambiguity and inconsistency in the words and sentences of the items derived with the prefinal adapted questionnaire. Subsequently, content and face validations were performed with 10 experts and 10 target users, respectively. Modified kappa statistic was used to determine the interrater agreement among the raters. The reliability of the M-MAUQ was assessed by 51 healthy young adult mobile phone users. Participants needed to install the MyFitnessPal app and use it for 2 days for familiarization before completing the designated task and answer the M-MAUQ. The MyFitnessPal app was selected because it is one among the most popular installed mHealth apps globally available for iPhone and Android users and represents a standalone mHealth app. RESULTS: The content validity index for the relevancy and clarity of M-MAUQ were determined to be 0.983 and 0.944, respectively, which indicated good relevancy and clarity. The face validity index for understandability was 0.961, which indicated that users understood the M-MAUQ. The kappa statistic for every item in M-MAUQ indicated excellent agreement between the raters ( ranging from 0.76 to 1.09). The Cronbach  for 18 items was .946, which also indicated good reliability in assessing the usability of the mHealth app. CONCLUSIONS: The M-MAUQ fulfilled the validation criteria as it revealed good reliability and validity similar to the original version. M-MAUQ can be used to assess the usability of mHealth apps in Malay in the future.","output":"Malay Version of the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (M-MAUQ): Translation, Adaptation, and Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 7-day consultant-geriatrician-led service across five surgical wards, with integrated working among surgeons and physicians, was implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Loneliness describes the perceived quality of ones own contacts and relationships with other individuals. Several prior studies reported associations of loneliness with different somatic and psychiatric disorders. AIM: To analyse the frequency of loneliness and its association with depression and anxiety symptoms in the first wave of the pandemic in Germany in May 2020. METHODS: The German National Cohort (NAKO) had recruited and examined 205,000 individuals aged 20 to 69 years in 18 study centres across Germany between 2014 and 2019. The follow-up examination was temporarily stopped due to the pandemic between March and July 2020. In this period a COVID-related questionnaire was developed and sent to all participants. We analysed the first 113,928 questionnaires that were sent back within four weeks in May 2020. Loneliness was assessed with the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms were collected using the PHQ?9 and GAD?7 scales from the Patient Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the NAKO participants, 31.7% reported to be lonely in May 2020. Women and young adults reported more loneliness than men and older adults. With increasing scores of loneliness, the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms also steadily increased. Individuals who were lonely during the pandemic had already reported higher PHQ?9 and GAD?7 scores during the baseline examination on average 2.5 years earlier, compared to those who did not feel lonely. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants of the German National Cohort, we observed an increase in loneliness during the first wave of the SARS-CoV?2 pandemic in spring 2020 and a strong relationship of increasing loneliness with decreasing mental health.","output":"Einsamkeit w?hrend der ersten Welle der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie C Ergebnisse der NAKO-Gesundheitsstudie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angioedema is a self-limited, localized tissue swelling, resulting from fluid extravasation into interstitial spaces.

This study aimed to establish optimal propofol anesthesia for therapeutic endoscopy, which has not been established. Methodology. We retrospectively investigated data on 89 patients who underwent upper-GI endoscopic submucosal dissection or endoscopic mucosal resection under anesthesia with propofol. Examined doses of propofol were changed according to efficacy and/or adverse events and classified into 5 periods. A bispectral index (BIS) monitor was used at Period 5 to decrease the incidence of adverse events caused by oversedation. The initial dose of propofol was administered after bolus injection of pethidine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg), and 1.0 mL of propofol was added every minute until the patients fell asleep. Continuous and bolus infusion were performed to maintain sedation. When the patient moved or an adverse event occurred, the maintenance dose examined was increased or decreased by 5 mL/h regardless of body weight. Results. Dose combinations (introduction : maintenance) and patient numbers for each period were as follows: Period 1 (n = 27), 0.5 mg/kg : 5 mg/kg/h; Period 2 (n = 11), 0.33 mg/kg : 3.3 mg/kg/h; Period 3 (n = 7), 0.5 mg/kg : 3.3 mg/kg/h; Period 4 (n = 14), 0.5 mg/kg : 2.5 mg/kg/h; Period 5 (n = 30), 0.5 mg/kg : 2.5 mg/kg/h, using BIS monitor. During Period 5, an adverse event occurred in 10.0% of patients, which was lower than that for Periods 1-4. Conclusions.

Therefore, the study assessed the health system response for the treatment and preventative care for diabetic patients amidst a pandemic situation under social distancing, and how it affects such health system responses in a developing country. Method: By using a cross-sectional descriptive study and collecting information through qualitative methods, the study assesses the patients ability to access medication, laboratory services, and preventative care. The study conducted twelve focus group discussions, 30 key informants interviews (KII), and reviewed twelve daily newspapers to analyze the condition of the health system response related to the treatment of diabetic patients. Results: : Most responding patients were aged 55-60 years. Healthcare professionals stated that increasing incidence of COVID-19 infection is witnessed among older diabetic patients. The study also found that complications of uncontrolled diabetes result in increasing costs of treatment, creating a burden on healthcare systems, and preventing patients from proper treatment in this lockdown situation. Conclusions: : With the problems specifically halting access to treatment under social distancing conditions, as well as a reluctance from health care providers to treat due to high infection rates from improper personal protective equipment (PPE) resourcing, lead to a concerning conclusion regarding diabetic healthcare systems in Bangladesh, that can benefit from telemedicine, faster and cheaper medication delivery, and popularizing diabetic testing tools.","output":"COVID-19 and Health System Response for Management of Diabetes in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objective: The COVID19 pandemic saw unprecedented increases in call volume to the New York City (NYC) 911 system. Several large health systems collaborated with the NYC Fire Department to transfer low-acuity 911 caller to hospital-based telemedicine services in to ease the burden on EMS. We describe the results of a single center participating in this program, and the results of a nurse follow-up program for diverted calls. Methods: Emergency dispatchers screened 911 calls using a computerized algorithm. Eligible calls were then transferred to hospital-based hotlines for further triage by a registered nurse (RN) or physician assistant (PA). An ambulance was dispatched for calls deemed not appropriate for telemedicine. Otherwise, medical information was given by the RN/PA or a telehealth visit was initiated. Data on demographics, clinical presentation and call outcomes were entered into a REDCap database during initial call. A RN attempted follow-up calls on all patients within 48 hours of initial during the first three months of the program. Results: Between 4/3/20 and 10/2/20, 459 calls were diverted to the triage line, averaging 6 to 10 calls per day. Calls originated from all five boroughs: Brooklyn (26.2%), Bronx (30.2%), Manhattan (23.5%), Queens (17.3%), and Staten Island (2.7%). The median age was 58 (range 4-85 years), and half were female. Shortness of breath (29%), nausea/vomiting (29%) and myalgias/malaise (23%) were the most common symptoms. Approximately 21.5% of calls were related to COVID-19. Among completed calls, 55% resulted in subsequent ambulance dispatch, most commonly due to medical necessity or patient preference. The proportion of calls resulting ambulance response after transfer increased as pandemic levels decreased largely due to patient preference. Among appropriate transfers, 35% were referred to telemedicine while 39% received medical advice from the triage RN/PA. However, only 15 patients were able to complete a telemedicine call, mostly due to technical issues accessing the telemedicine platform. Among the 320 attempted follow-ups, 144 patients (45%) were contacted. Many patients (60%) called 911 again after triage;none of the 15 patients completing a telemedicine visit sought additional care. Thirty-three patients had been admitted to the hospital since the initial call, with one patient in the ICU. Conclusion: Our institution successfully participated in a NYC-wide pilot to divert selected 911 calls to hospital-based telemedicine resulting in fewer ambulance dispatches and more appropriate allocation of EMS resources during the pandemic. However, many callers sought subsequent care after diversion with some requiring hospitalization, and patient acceptance of diversion decreased as pandemic conditions improved. More specific initial screening algorithms, public education campaigns and streamlined IT workflows could significantly increase the volume and effectiveness of similar 911 diversion programs.

The criteria for cold/flu definition, however, are variable within and between individuals and illness is not prerequisite for a viral upper respiratory tract infection. These factors bias estimates of the incidence and prevalence of viral upper respiratory tract infections and their complications. Here we review new methodologies that can be adapted for use in future studies to refine those estimates. RECENT FINDINGS We present a theoretical basis for standardized assignment of cold/flu episodes using a minimal algorithm template that operates on a structured set of symptoms/signs. We emphasize the greater accuracy of information derived from longitudinal studies that incorporate identification algorithms and assay of nasal secretions for causal virus by polymerase chain reaction and for proinflammatory chemicals to confirm nasal inflammation. SUMMARY The methodologies and sampling strategies that we describe hold promise for better characterizing the incidence of complications for symptomatic and asymptomatic expressions of a viral upper respiratory tract infection caused by specific viruses. These data can then be used to estimate the efficacy and efficiency in a specified target population of prophylactic or intercurrent treatments to prevent the complications.","output":"Use of diagnostic algorithms and new technologies to study the incidence and prevalence of viral upper respiratory tract infections and their complications in high risk populations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In spring 2020, the COVID-19 lockdown placed unprecedented restrictions on the behaviour and movements of the UK population. Citizens were ordered to 'stay at home', only allowed to leave their houses to buy essential supplies, attend medical appointments or exercise once a day. This qualitative study explored how 'lockdown' and its subsequent easing changed young children's everyday activities, eating and sleep habits to gain insight into the impact for health and wellbeing. Methods In summer 2020 we interviewed 20 parents of children due to start school in September 2020 (aged 3-5 years) by phone or video call to explore their experiences of lockdown and its easing. We recruited participants through nurseries and local Facebook community groups in the South West and West Midlands of England. Half the sample were from Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic backgrounds and half lived in the most deprived quintile. We analysed interviews using thematic analysis. Results Children's activity, screen time, eating, and sleep routines had some level of disruption. Parents reported children ate more snacks during lockdown, but also spent more time preparing meals and eating as a family. Most parents reported a reduction in their children's physical activity and an increase in screen time, which some linked to difficulties in getting their child to sleep. Parents sometimes expressed guilt about changes in activity, screen time and snacking over lockdown. Most felt these changes would be temporary with no lasting impact, though others worried about re-establishing healthy routines. Conclusions The spring COVID-19 lockdown negatively impacted on pre-school children's eating, activity and sleep routines. While some positive changes were reported, there were wide-spread reports of lack of routines, habits and boundaries which, at least in the short-term, were likely to have been detrimental for child health and development. Guidance and support for families during times of COVID-19 restrictions could be valuable to help them maintain healthy activity, eating, screen-time and sleeping routines to protect child health and ensure unhealthy habits are not adopted.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 restrictions on pre-school children's eating, activity and sleep behaviours: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), broke out in December 2019, is a global pandemic. Rapidly in the past few months, a large number of clinical studies have been initiated worldwide to find effective therapeutics, vaccines, and preventive strategies. In this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the gaps and issues that may cause difficulty in recruitment and the lack of population representativeness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 2,034 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public registry - ClinicalTrials.gov. Leveraging natural language processing, descriptive analysis, association analysis, and clustering analysis, we characterized COVID-19 clinical studies by phase and design features. Particularly, we analyzed their eligibility criteria to understand: (1) whether they considered the reported underlying health conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) if these studies excluded older adults, either explicitly or implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies in older adults. RESULTS: The 5 most frequently tested drugs are Hydroxychloroquine (N=148), Azithromycin (N=46), Tocilizumab (N=29), Lopinavir (N=20), and Ritonavir (N=20). Most trials did not have an upper age limit and did not exclude patients with common chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes that are prevalent in older adults. However, known risk factors that may lead to severe illnesses have not been adequately considered by existing studies. CONCLUSIONS: A careful examination of the registered COVID-19 clinical studies can identify the research gaps and inform future COVID-19 trial design towards balanced internal validity and generalizability.","output":"How the clinical research community responded to the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of the COVID-19 clinical studies in ClinicalTrials.gov"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the impact of an enhanced QI support programme (ESP) in further improving the magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) uptake compared to the National PReCePT Programme (NPP) model. Design: An unblinded cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: NHS England and the AHSN network in 2018. Participants: Maternity units with []10 pre-term deliveries annually and MgSO4 uptake []70%. 40 maternity units (27 NPP, 13 ESP) were included. Randomisation was stratified by MgSO4 uptake. Interventions: MgSO4 reduces the risk of cerebral palsy by 30%. NHS England commissioned the AHSN network in 2018 to deliver the NPP to increase MgSO4 uptake in all maternity units in England. NPP units received PReCePT QI materials, regional support, and midwife backfill funding. ESP units received NPP plus backfill funding, unit-level QI coaching, and tablet computer Main outcome measures: MgSO4 uptake post-implementation was compared between trial groups. Implementation and lifetime costs, and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated. The implementation process, fidelity, and local adaptations were assessed through a qualitative process evaluation. Results: Using routine data and multivariable linear regression, both ESP and NPP units increased uptake between pre- and post-implementation. Post-implementation uptake increase in ESP units was similar to NPP units (-0.84 percentage points difference, 95% Confidence Interval -5.03 to 3.35 percentage points). Decision tree and probabilistic analyses were used to estimate cost-effectiveness and the probability ESP cost-effective was < 30%. Midwives implementing the NPP allocated more than their funded hours. Implementers of the ESP had better overall understanding of and collective engagement in PReCePT QI and made more use of QI methods. Units varied in amount and kind of support required to successfully implement the intervention. Conclusion: This trial did not find additional benefit from the ESP compared with the NPP. Units with low uptake of MgSO4 were found to experience a range of local challenges and targeted enhanced support may improve performance and represent good value.

Framework of the solution: There already is a very large set of publications that describe the extent and outcomes of health disparities. An extensive data set also describes mitigation strategies. Changing the outcomes includes policy changes within the health care system but also with regulatory agencies and the legislative branch of government. It is critical that these different systems are armed with the totality of available information in a manner that can be leveraged to improve the health care of all. We have developed a system of describing large sets of data manually extracted from published articles. These results are aggregated together independent of the framework of the manuscript so that similar outcomes can be placed side by side. This system can provide the necessary comprehensive data that is available today to begin to implement changes. Results to date: We have used COVID-19 publications as a prototype topic that has so many articles no single person can comprehend or manage. We extracted data from 1000 COVID-19 manuscripts that presented new data. This rendered 26,000 note fields arranged in a parent child relationship. The data base described 12,000 individual observations. A read only version is available at COVIDpublications.org. We are now applying this system to bias and stigma of the health care profession to persons who use drugs, and a demo of this project is available at (https://app.refbin.com/app/embed?m=1188). We have now established the rules to manually extract data from any clinical article that presents new data. This involves 4 types of note fields per observation arranged in parent child relationships. 1) The observation, 2) description of the observation, 3) the population, and 4) the topic. This system allows the observations from an unlimited number of studies to share parents. This results in about a 5-fold reduction in the total number of note fields. It also allows grouping of information so that a user can scan the data base and access the entirety of information without specifically knowing what they are looking for. Conclusions: We are expanding this data base bias and systemic racism of the health care system on persons with substance use disorder to include the broader range of patients. By capturing all of the data that is known we hope to influence implementation of improved health care to patients including those with cancer.

Targeting the genes encoding such proteins paves the way for controlling these parasites. Centrin is an essential gene, which its protein product seems to be vital for the proliferation of Leishmania parasites. Herein, this study was contrived to analyze the expression level of the centrin gene in different growth phases and forms of Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) parasites isolated from various endemic areas of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Iran. RESULTS: All three collected isolates were identified as L. infantum using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed a statistically significant up-regulation (3.13-fold) in the logarithmic phase promastigotes compared to stationary ones (p < 0.01), whereas centrin was expressed equally in intracellular amastigotes at different time points during cell culture. Also, our finding revealed a slight up-regulation of the centrin gene (1.22-fold) in the intracellular amastigotes compared to logarithmic phase promastigotes, which was found statistically non-significant (p > 0.05).

This study aims to investigate the impact of three pre-COVID-19 interventions and of the COVID-19 UK-epidemic and the first UK national lockdown on overcrowding within University College London Hospital Emergency Department (UCLH ED). The three interventions: target the influx of patients at ED (A), reduce the pressure on in-patients' beds (B) and improve ED processes to improve the flow of patents out from ED (C). METHODS: We collected overcrowding metrics (daily attendances, the proportion of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (four-hours target) and the reduction in overall waiting time) during 01/04/2017-31/05/2020. We then performed three different analyses, considering three different timeframes. The first analysis used data 01/04/2017-31/12-2019 to calculate changes over a period of 6 months before and after the start of interventions A-C. The second and third analyses focused on evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, comparing the first 10 months in 2020 and 2019, and of the first national lockdown (23/03/2020-31/05/2020). RESULTS: Pre-COVID-19 all interventions led to small reductions in waiting time (17%, p < 0.001 for A and C; an 9%, p = 0.322 for B) but also to a small decrease in the number of patients leaving within 4 h of arrival (6.6,7.4,6.2% respectively A-C,p < 0.001). In presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance and waiting time were reduced (40% and 8%; p < 0.001), and the number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival was increased (6%,p < 0.001). During the first lockdown, there was 65% reduction in attendance, 22% reduction in waiting time and 8% increase in number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (p < 0.001). Crucially, when the lockdown was lifted, there was an increase (6.5%,p < 0.001) in the percentage of people leaving within 4 h, together with a larger (12.5%,p < 0.001) decrease in waiting time. This occurred despite the increase of 49.6%(p < 0.001) in attendance after lockdown ended. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed results pre-COVID-19 (significant improvements in waiting time with some interventions but not improvement in the four-hours target), may be due to indirect impacts of these interventions, where increasing pressure on one part of the ED system affected other parts. This underlines the need for multifaceted interventions and a system-wide approach to improve the pathway of flow through the ED system is necessary. During 2020 and in presence of the COVID-19 epidemic, a shift in public behaviour with anxiety over attending hospitals and higher use of virtual consultations, led to notable drop in UCLH ED attendance and consequential curbing of overcrowding. Importantly, once the lockdown was lifted, although there was an increase in arrivals at UCLH ED, overcrowding metrics were reduced. Thus, the combination of shifted public behaviour and the restructuring changes during COVID-19 epidemic, maybe be able to curb future ED overcrowding, but longer timeframe analysis is required to confirm this.","output":"Exploring overcrowding trends in an inner city emergence department in the UK before and during COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OPINION STATEMENT JAK (janus kinase) inhibitors are becoming increasingly prescribed for various conditions from dermatologic diseases to graft versus host disease in bone marrow transplant recipients. This class of drugs has been found to be truly life-changing for many, though they are not without potential adverse effects. While JAK inhibitors have not been shown to significantly increase the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in large scale clinical trials, NMSC is one of the most concerning possible adverse events, and there have been several reported cases of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas, especially in our already immunosuppressed patient populations. In these patients, it is incredibly important that patients are on the lowest possible dosage of the JAK inhibitor. In addition, these patients must be routinely screened by a dermatologist with a comprehensive skin exam to ensure early detection if skin cancer was to develop. For those patients diagnosed with skin cancer, early intervention is key to optimize outcomes, and at times, multi-disciplinary care coordination is needed. In the future, large-scale studies with longer follow-up of patients would help determine whether JAK inhibitors significantly increase the risk of NMSC.","output":"Janus Kinase Inhibitors and Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews the correlation between angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) and the possible mechanisms.

The current pandemic has inflicted almost unimaginable grief, sorrow, loss, and terror at a global scale. One of the great ironies with the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, particularly early on, is counter intuitive. The speed at which specialized basic and clinical sciences described the details of the damage to humans in COVID\\\\19 disease has been impressive. Equally, the development of vaccines in an amazingly short time interval has been extraordinary. However, what has been less well understood has been the fundamental elements that underpin the progression of COVID\\\\19 in an individual and in populations. We have used systems analysis approaches with human physiology and pharmacology to explore the fundamental underpinnings of COVID\\\\19 disease. Pharmacology powerfully captures the thermodynamic characteristics of molecular binding with an exogenous entity such as a virus and its consequences on the living processes well described by human physiology. Thus, we have documented the passage of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 from infection of a single cell to species jump, to tropism, variant emergence and widespread population infection. During the course of this review, the recurrent observation was the efficiency and simplicity of one critical function of this virus. The lethality of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is due primarily to its ability to possess and use a variable surface for binding to a specific human target with high affinity. This binding liberates Gibbs free energy (GFE) such that it satisfies the criteria for thermodynamic spontaneity. Its binding is the prelude to human host cellular entry and replication by the appropriation of host cell constituent molecules that have been produced with a prior energy investment by the host cell. It is also a binding that permits viral tropism to lead to high levels of distribution across populations with newly formed virions. This thermodynamic spontaneity is repeated endlessly as infection of a single host cell spreads to bystander cells, to tissues, to humans in close proximity and then to global populations. The principal antagonism of this process comes from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 itself, with its relentless changing of its viral surface configuration, associated with the inevitable emergence of variants better configured to resist immune sequestration and importantly with a greater affinity for the host target and higher infectivity. The great value of this physiological and pharmacological perspective is that it reveals the fundamental thermodynamic underpinnings of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.","output":"Systems analysis shows that thermodynamic physiological and pharmacological fundamentals drive COVID\\\\19 and response to treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Well-Known Institute of Management is situated in New Delhi, India, and offers a 2-year fully residential post-graduate program in Management (MBA) and a doctoral-level program While the permanent and fully residential campus of the institute with state-of-the-art facilities is under construction (expected to be completed by June 2024), the institute is currently functioning from a rented transit campus With the increase in intake in July 2020 and subsequently in 2021, the total number of students in the campus is going to increase from 240 to 400 Two buildings are hired on rent which is 1?km away from the transit campus The IT team of the institute is asked to conduct a survey, analyze, and propose a solution to provide networking and Internet facilities for 150 students who are going to reside in the newly hired hostel buildings Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the networking requirement has changed Dr Vivek Gupta, Assistant Professor in the area of IT and systems at Well-Known Institute of Management, is heading the IT team of the institute Puzzled between various options of buying network infrastructure on premise or buying it as a service (infrastructure as a service), Dr Gupta needs to do a thorough analysis before recommending a feasible and plausible solution","output":"Networking infrastructure decision at Well-Known Institute of Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The information of how COVID-19 infection affects people living with HIV (PLHIV) is still scarce METHODS: Observational study was conducted in four of public hospitals in Madrid All HIV patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease were included and compared with COVID-19 infected patients without HIV infection RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with HIV infection were analysed The median age was 46 years (IQR: 37-56 years), 88 9% were men The median time of HIV infection was 10 8 years (IQR: 6 5 - 16 8 years), 96 8% were on antiretroviral therapy 84 1% had previous comorbidities The most common symptoms were fever(66 1%), cough(66 1%) and dyspnea(46 8%) Pneumonia was found in 47 5%, 28 6% of patients had severe disease and 32 3% was admitted to hospital The ICU admission rate and the mortality rate were both 3 17% Significant association was observed between age, arterial hypertension, overweight, diabetes mellitus and the severity of COVID-19 disease No association was observed between HIV-related factors The rate of COVID-19 disease in HIV-patients was 1,68% A similar hospitalization (31 74% vs 32 57%) and ICU admission rate (3 17% vs 2%) was observed with non-HIV infected patients A lower mortality rate during hospitalization (10% vs 21 37%) and global mortality rate (3 17% vs 6 96%) were observed CONCLUSIONS: Established poor prognostic factors, such as age and comorbidities, represent also the main determinants for PLHIV Neither the HIV severity, nor the type of ARV treatment seem to influence the outcome of COVID-19 infection Large prospective cohorts are needed in order to establish the differences between HIV positive and negative patients","output":"Covid-19 Disease in People Living with Hiv: a Multicenter Case-series Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host-influenza virus interplay at the transcript level has been extensively characterized in epithelial cells.

Strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the infected BEAS-2B cells allowed for simultaneous analysis of host and viral transcriptomes, in addition to pathogen genomes, to reveal changes in mRNA expression and alternative splicing (AS). In general, patterns of global and immune gene expression induced by the three IAVs were mostly shared. However, AS of host transcripts and small nuclear RNAs differed between the seasonal and laboratory strains. Analysis of viral transcriptomes showed deletions of the polymerase components (defective interfering-like RNAs) within the genome. Surprisingly, we found that the neuraminidase gene undergoes AS and that the splicing event differs between seasonal and laboratory strains.

A defective redox balance has been related to viral pathogenesis developing a massive induction of cell death provoked by oxidative stress. The aim of this study is to perform a complete oxidative stress profile evaluation regarding antioxidant enzymes, total antioxidant capacity and oxidative cell damage in order to characterize its role in diagnosis and severity of this disease. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 108 COVID-19 patients and 28 controls and metabolites representative of oxidative stress were assessed. The association between lipid peroxidation and 28-day intubation/death risk was evaluated by multivariable regression analysis. Probability of intubation/death to day-28 was analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier curves and tested with the log-rank test. RESULTS: Antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase) and oxidative cell damage (Carbonyl and Lipid peroxidation (LPO)) levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients while total antioxidant capacity (ABTS and FRAP) levels were lower in these patients. The comparison of oxidative stress molecules levels across COVID-19 severity revealed that only LPO was statistically different between mild and intubated/death COVID-19 patients. COX multivariate regression analysis identified LPO levels over the OOP (LPO>1948.17 M) as an independent risk factor for 28-day intubation/death in COVID-19 patients [OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.10C5.99; p = 0.029].

OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there might be a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. METHODS: ON rabbit model was induced based on our established protocol. Dynamic-MRI was employed for local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation in bilateral femora. Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPAR2). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON(+ )(with at least one ON lesion) group and ON(- )(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON(+ )rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion). RESULTS: Local intra-osseous perfusion index was found lower in either ON(+ )or MON group when compared to either ON(- )or SON group, whereas the marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON(+ )or MON group as compared with ON(- )and SON group.

How do institutions make a case for continuous investment in HPE scholarship? Despite being a relatively new and small private university with no public funding, IMU has made fairly significant progress in delivering a unique model of HPE programmes with HPE scholarly output. This commentary discusses the importance of investing in scholarship for HPE with the International Medical University (IMU) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as a case study. Examples of institutional initiatives that support and enhance scholarship are presented based on the recent AMEE guide (142) on redefining scholarship.","output":"Investing in scholarship for health professions education: Learning from the past to move into the future."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: As of December 2020, COVID19 has infected over 13 million Americans and killed over 275,000. Each infection surge leads to increased emergency department (ED) utilization and subsequent critical care admission for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Not all COVID19 patients necessitate a ventilator and therefore can remain at home to minimize infection spread and manage hospital capacity concerns. Remote Bluetooth-enabled pulse-oximeter monitoring of moderate-to-severely ill COVID19 patients can be used to closely monitor symptoms and trigger necessary visits to the hospital. Our objective was to analyze remote pulse-oximeter monitoring cost-effectiveness to reduce facility burden and health expenditures. Methods: We analyzed home-monitoring with pulse-oximetry cost-utility using a Markov model over a 3-week time horizon in daily cycles from a US health sector perspective. Cost and outcome measures were derived from real-world evidence from University Hospitals. Pulse-oximetry monitoring was implemented for patients presenting at the ED with ARDS-like symptoms but not necessitating immediate care;patients were then remotely monitored by experts for up to 4-days until recovery or a second ED visit. Additional parameters were extracted from literature. Costs (2020 U.S. dollars) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were used to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at a $100,000/QALY cost-effectiveness threshold. Model uncertainty was assessed using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Results demonstrated that pulse-oximetry monitoring dominated current standard care for COVID19 patients based on reduced costs and increased QALYs. Individuals with access to remote pulse-oximetry monitoring averaged $49,176 and 0.03 QALYs, whereas standard care increased costs to $113,792 and 0.02 QALYs. Resulting ICER was not sensitive to uncertainty ranges. Conclusions: Remote pulse-oximetry monitoring of symptomatic COVID19 patients increases the specificity of those requiring immediate follow-up. We recommend adoption of this technology across health systems to cost-effectively manage COVID19 volume surges, maintain patients comfort, reduce infection spread, and simultaneously monitor multiple patients.","output":"PIN21 The Cost-Utility of Remote Pulse-Oximeter Monitoring of COVID19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), thromboembolism is a frequently reported complication.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate administered within 72 h of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult individuals with pre-existing risk factors at higher risk of getting seriously ill with COVID-19. Camostat mesylate acts as an inhibitor of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 and prevents the virus from entering the cell. CP represents another antiviral strategy in terms of passive immunization. The working hypothesis to be tested in the RES-Q-HR study is that the early use of CP or camostat mesylate reduces the likelihood of disease progression to (modified) WHO stages 4b-8 in SARS-CoV-2-positive adult patients at high risk of moderate or severe COVID-19 progression. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a 4-arm (parallel group), multicenter, randomized (2:2:1:1 ratio), partly double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) or camostat mesylate with control or placebo in adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and high risk for progression to moderate/severe COVID-19.

Decades of international research shows that, across Europe, men have shorter life expectancies and higher mortality rates than women, and yet, women report higher morbidity. These gender-based health inequalities also appear to be evident within the pandemic and its aftermath. The article starts by providing an overview of the 'gender health paradox' and the biological, social, economic and political explanations for it. It then outlines the international estimates of gender-based inequalities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates - where emerging data suggests that women are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 but that men have a higher mortality rate. It then explores the longer term consequences for gender-based health inequalities of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the impacts of government policy responses and the emerging economic crisis, suggesting that this might lead to increased mortality amongst men and increased morbidity amongst women. The essay concludes by reflecting on the pathways shaping gender-based health inequalities in the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses needed to ensure that it does not exacerbate gender-based health inequalities into the future.","output":"COVID-19 and the gender health paradox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. DDX3X variants are a common cause of intellectual disability (ID) in females. Previous studies have reported high rates of autism spectrum disorder and emotional-behavioural difficulties within this group. However, no study has compared social and emotional characteristics in individuals with DDX3X variants to individuals with other monogenic causes of ID. Methods. Twenty-three females with pathogenic or likely pathogenic DDX3X variants were recruited via UK regional genetics centres, genetic research cohorts, and family support groups. Twenty-three females with ID and variants in other genes were recruited via the same routes. Phenotypic data were collected through semi-structured interviews and standardised questionnaires. Results. In line with previous research, we found a wide range of adaptive, social and emotional function within the DDX3X group. Autism characteristics assessed via the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) did not differ between DDX3X and comparison groups, while levels of anxiety and self-injurious behaviour (SIB) scores assessed via the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC) were significantly higher in the DDX3X group. Autistic characteristics, anxiety and SIB scores were positively correlated within the DDX3X group. Individuals with DDX3X missense variants had poorer adaptive abilities than those with protein truncating variants as previously reported, but DDX3X variant type did not significantly predict emotional and behavioural characteristics. Conclusions. We provide quantitative evidence that overall incidence of autistic characteristics is not higher amongst girls and women with DDX3X variants than expected for ID. However, the DDX3X group demonstrates more SIBs and anxiety symptoms than expected, with close relationships between SIBs and anxiety, and between anxiety and autistic characteristics. Future work is warranted to explore the multilevel mechanisms contributing to social and emotional development in individuals with DDX3X variants, and consider whether these mechanisms are specific to this genetic diagnosis or shared with a subset of people with ID due to other causes.","output":"Social and emotional characteristics of girls and young women with DDX3X-linked intellectual disability: A descriptive and comparative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initiation of RNA synthesis by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) NS5B has been extensively studied in vitro and in cellulo Intracellular replication is thought to rely exclusively on terminal de novo initiation, as it conserves all genetic information of the genome. In vitro, however, additional modes of initiation have been observed. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the intracellular environment allows for internal initiation of RNA replication by the HCV replicase. We used a dual luciferase replicon harboring a terminal and an internal copy of the viral genomic 5' UTR, which was anticipated to support non-canonical initiation. Indeed, a shorter RNA species was detected by northern blotting with low frequency, depending on the length and sequence composition upstream of the internal initiation site. By introducing mutations at either site, we furthermore established that internal and terminal initiation shared identical sequence requirements. Importantly, lethal point mutations at the terminal site resulted exclusively in truncated replicons. In contrast, the same mutations at the internal site abrogated internal initiation, suggesting a competitive selection of initiation sites, rather than recombination or template-switching events. In conclusion, our data indicate that the HCV replicase is capable of internal initiation in its natural environment, although functional replication likely requires only terminal initiation. Since many other positive strand RNA viruses generate subgenomic messenger RNAs during their replication cycle, we surmise that the capability for internal initiation it is a common and conserved feature of viral RdRps.ImportanceMany aspects of viral RNA replication of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still poorly understood. The process of RNA synthesis is driven by the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase NS5B. Most mechanistic studies on NS5B so far were performed with in vitro systems using isolated recombinant polymerase. In this study we present a replicon model, which allows the intracellular assessment of non-canonical modes of initiation by the full HCV replicase. Our results add to the understanding of the biochemical processes underlying initiation of RNA synthesis by NS5B by the discovery of internal initiation in cellulo Moreover, they validate observations made in vitro, showing that the viral polymerase acts very similarly in isolation and in complex with other viral and host proteins. Finally, these observations provide clues about the evolution of RdRps of positive strand RNA viruses, which might contain the intrinsic ability to initiate internally.","output":"Evidence for internal initiation of RNA synthesis by the Hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B in cellulo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on a scientific national survey (N = 3,933;including 3,188 registered voters), this report describes Americans coronavirus knowledge, attitudes, vulnerabilities, protective behaviors, and communication needs in an effort to inform the public health community, policymakers, and the public.","output":"American Public Responses to COVID-19, April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Retrospective studies have drawn attention to possible detrimental effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the anastomotic leakage rate after colorectal resection.

METHODS This was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled experimental study in 60 male Wistar rats treated with diclofenac 4 mg/kg/day or placebo. In each rat, a colonic anastomosis was performed and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) tube was placed subcutaneously. Incisional and anastomotic wound breaking strength and hydroxyproline content in the ePTFE tubes were measured 7 days after the operation. RESULTS We found no significant differences in any of the breaking strength measurements, but showed a median 38% reduction in hydroxyproline deposition as a result of diclofenac treatment (p = 0.03). In the placebo group, subcutaneous collagen deposition tended to correlate positively with skin incisional but negatively with anastomotic bio-mechanical strength. CONCLUSION Postoperative diclofenac treatment significantly inhibited collagen deposition in subcutaneous granulation tissue. Anastomotic strength and skin wound strength were not significantly affected.

The aim of the study was to assess if alterations in gene expression of microRNAs associated with diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases are present in whole peripheral blood of children aged 3-11 years descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. A substantially altered microRNA expression profile was found in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. Almost all microRNAs with the exception of miR-92a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-210-3p were upregulated. The microRNA expression profile also differed between children after normal and GDM complicated pregnancies in relation to the presence of overweight/obesity, prehypertension/hypertension, and/or valve problems and heart defects. Always, screening based on the combination of microRNAs was superior over using individual microRNAs, since at 10.0% false positive rate it was able to identify a large proportion of children with an aberrant microRNA expression profile (88.14% regardless of clinical findings, 75.41% with normal clinical findings, and 96.49% with abnormal clinical findings). In addition, the higher incidence of valve problems and heart defects was found in children with a prior exposure to GDM. The extensive file of predicted targets of all microRNAs aberrantly expressed in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies indicates that a large group of these genes is involved in ontologies of diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases. In general, children with a prior exposure to GDM are at higher risk of later development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases, and would benefit from dispensarisation as well as implementation of primary prevention strategies.","output":"Substantially Altered Expression Profile of Diabetes/Cardiovascular/Cerebrovascular Disease Associated microRNAs in Children Descending from Pregnancy Complicated by Gestational Diabetes Mellitus-One of Several Possible Reasons for an Increased Cardiovascular Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Komenti is a reasoner-enabled semantic query and information extraction framework.

In fact, as COVID-19 prevalence decreases, this remains the main preventive measure to avoid rebound. However, inconsistent results due to biological sample variability in collection timing post infection and sampling procedures, misleads our application in clinic. METHODS: We applied Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Logistic regression on the RT-PCR results from 258 confirmed patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the factors associated with negative conversion. We also estimated the negative percentages among patients who had tested twice or more and compared the proportions by oropharyngeal swab, sputum and combined double testing, respectively. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of negative conversion was 6.7% at the 4(th) day, 16.4% at the 7(th) day, 41.0% at two weeks and 61.0% at three-weeks post-admission. We also found 34.1% and 60.3% with at least one negative RT-PCR result at the 7(th) days and 14(th) days after symptom onset, respectively. The negative proportion in sputum was higher than that in oropharyngeal swab in the early stage but lowered after symptoms. CONCLUSION: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, efficient testing strategies are critical to control COVID-19 epidemic.

METHODS: This is a cluster-randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02631161). 88 patients (50-70 years) with 175 sNCCLs were randomized to receive GH or RC. Restorations were placed without mechanical cavity preparation and followed for a mean 36 (min/max: 31/55) months (variable follow-up due to COVID-19 lockdown). Restoration quality was re-evaluated at 1-, 18- and 36-months using FDI-criteria. Survival was assessed using multi-level Cox-regression analysis. Costs were estimated from a payer's perspective in Germany. Initial costs were determined based on micro-costing using time recordings and hourly costs, and follow-up costs based on statutory insurance fee-item-catalogues. RESULTS: 88 patients (175 restorations) were treated; 43 received GH (83 restorations), 45 RC (92 restorations). 17a? GH and 19 RC showed total retention loss, 5a? GH were partially lost (pa?=a?0.396/Cox). FDI ratings were not sufficiently different for any domain except surface luster, where RC showed higher score (pa?<a?0.001). Costs were initially lower for GH (32.57; SD 16.36 ?) than RC (44.25; SD 21.40 ?), while re-treatment costs were similar (GH: 9.15; SD 15.70 ?; RC: 7.35; SD 14.51 ?), resulting in significantly lower costs for GH (GH: 41.72; SD 25.08 ?) than RC (51.60; 26.17 ?)

The air used by the forced-air coolingsystem is sucked from the closed environment of the patient through an aeration port, located close to the light source andevacuated out of the box by one or two ventilators. No filter existed to avoid the dispersion of particles outside of theprocessor box. The light source box also contains an insufflation air pump. The air is sucked from the light source boxthrough one or two holes of the air pump and pushed from the air pump into the air pipe of the endoscope through a plastictube. As the air pump did not had no dedicated HEPA filter, microorganisms transmission cannot be excluded. Conclusions Changes are necessary to prevent airborne transmission: exclusive use of an external CO2 pump andwrapping the endoscope platform by a plastic film that will limit microorganism scattering. In the era of pandemic virus withairborne transmission, improvement of GI ventilation system are necessary to avoid patients and health care workerscontamination.","output":"Air circulation in gastrointestinal light source box and endoscope in the era of sars-cov-2 and microorganisms airborne transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Family caregivers of hospice patients faced additional challenges in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where social isolation and loneliness that are often observed among those taking care of a loved one at the end of life, were exacerbated by social distancing rules and workflow changes introduced by hospice agencies.

Our results show that primary IgM responses to FMDV vaccination only became evident as Mat-Abs titers decreased. Likewise, prime and boost vaccination schedules, applied 35 days apart to groups of calves with high or low levels of Mat-Abs, showed that the levels of preexisting neutralizing Mat-Abs prevented the loss of total Abs measured by LPB-ELISA but negatively interfered with the induction of virus neutralizing responses.

The goal of this consensus statement is to examine the current evidence for performing tracheostomy in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 and offer guidance to physicians on the preparation, timing, and technique while minimizing the risk of infection to health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A panel including intensivists and interventional pulmonologists from three professional societies representing 13 institutions with experience in managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health-care environments developed key clinical questions addressing specific topics on tracheostomy in COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature and an established modified Delphi consensus methodology were applied to provide a reliable evidence-based consensus statement and expert panel report. RESULTS: Eight key questions, corresponding to 14 decision points, were rated by the panel. The results were aggregated, resulting in eight main recommendations and five additional remarks intended to guide health-care providers in the decision-making process pertinent to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: This panel suggests performing tracheostomy in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A specific timing of tracheostomy cannot be recommended. There is no evidence for routine repeat reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing in patients with confirmed COVID-19 evaluated for tracheostomy. To reduce the risk of infection in HCWs, we recommend performing the procedure using techniques that minimize aerosolization while wearing enhanced personal protective equipment. The recommendations presented in this statement may change as more experience is gained during this pandemic.","output":"Use of Tracheostomy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: American College of Chest Physicians/American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology/Association of Interventional Pulmonology Program Directors Expert Panel Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims Out-of-hours (on-call) work can be perceived by junior doctors to be a daunting experience, associated with feeling unprepared and less supported. Simulated on-call programmes have been used to great effect in medicine and surgery to improve junior doctors skills in task prioritisation, interpersonal communication and confidence on-call. However, few psychiatry-specific programmes exist. We aimed to: i) Develop a psychiatry specific virtual-on-call programme, ii) Investigate if the virtual-on-call programme improved confidence amongst junior trainees in key areas of psychiatry practice. Method The Psychiatry Virtual-On-Call programme commenced in December 2020. It involves attending an introductory on-call lecture, followed later in the rotation by a 2-hour simulated on-call shift. All trainees are expected to attend during their attachment and the simulated shifts are ongoing. During the shift, trainees are bleeped with different psychiatry specific tasks. They work through the tasks, using local intranet policies and telephone advice from the on-call psychiatry registrar. Due to COVID-19 the sessions were delivered virtually. Participants completed a questionnaire evaluating confidence in ten domains, rated on a Likert scale from 0C10. Questionnaires were completed at four time-points during the programme;pre- and post-introductory lecture and pre- and post-simulated shift. Scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Significance was defined as P < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple testing. Result Twenty-nine trainees attended the introductory lecture, 25 and 21 trainees completed the pre- and post-lecture questionnaire respectively. A non-significant improvement in confidence was reported in three domains: seclusions reviews, prescribing, detention under the mental health act. At the time of writing, ten trainees had attended the on-call shift. All participants completed a pre- and post-session questionnaire. The on-call shift was a useful learning experience (median score 9), and significantly increased perceived preparedness for on-call work from 3/10 to 7/10 (p < 0.001). Confidence was significantly improved in seven domains, most markedly in seclusion reviews, prescribing and mental health act tasks. Conclusion The psychiatry virtual-on-call programme fills a niche in the training curriculum and is perceived by trainees to be a useful learning experience. The introductory lecture improved confidence in several domains, but not as effectively as the on-call shift. The on-call shift was well received by participants and significantly improved confidence in 7/10 domains. In summary, the virtual-on-call experience improves preparedness for out-of-hours psychiatry work. Follow-up of participants at the end of their psychiatry rotation will ascertain if they felt the programme to be useful during out-of-hours work.","output":"The psychiatry virtual-on-call experience: Can it improve confidence of foundation and GP trainees with out-of-hours work in psychiatry?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) is being extensively investigated as a treatment, with mixed results to date.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to separate study design variables that could affect clinical outcome after CCP therapy. We focus here on variables such as pretransfusion antibody testing in recipients, dose adjustments and antibody affinity measurements. SOURCES: We searched PubMed and preprint servers for relevant preclinical and clinical studies discussing each of these variables in the field of CCP therapy. CONTENT: We show evidence that neglecting those variables has affected the outcomes of the vast majority of CCP clinical trials to date. IMPLICATIONS: A better understanding of such variables will improve the design of the next generation of CCP clinical trials.

Results: Between the first and second surveys, the number of individuals with high death anxiety rose from 48.1C53.2%, while the incidence of PTSD increased from 7C10.4%. PTSD was found to be significantly associated with living community contact history, poor health status of participants, history of life-threatening experiences, high death anxiety level, and non-medical occupation. Compared with other occupations, medical staff suffer more lasting death anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 epidemic, adverse psychological symptoms were prevalent among the general population in China.High death anxiety also was an important factor affecting PTSD.Therefore, means to address death anxiety must be included in the plan for the management of psychological effects of public health emergency and high-risk groups such as medical personnel should receive targeted intervention.","output":"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Death Anxiety Symptoms During the Coronavirus Epidemic in 2019: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on the Affected Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Immunological memory is the basis for vaccination. Currently, the longitudinal profiles of antibody responses in recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients have not been fully characterized. METHODS In this study we sequentially followed up 19 recovered SARS patients over a 3-y period in order to characterize the dynamic changes in antibody responses against viral components in detail. In addition, 4 blood samples were obtained at month 60. RESULTS We found that immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and their neutralizing activities decreased throughout the entire phase of the study. For IgG antibodies in the 3rd y, the positive rate of whole-virus-specific antibodies was 42%, which was tested with commercial kits at 1/10 dilution of the sera. In comparison, the positive rate of spike (S) protein-specific antibodies was 100%, which was tested by spike protein-based ELISA at 1/100 dilution; 4 samples at month 60 were included. The average optical density (OD) reading of nucleocapsid (N) protein-specific antibodies fell dramatically between month 3 and month 12, and it decreased gradually at low levels that were a little higher than the cut-off value from month 12. For neutralizing antibodies, neutralizing activity was detectable in 89% of recovered patients in the 3rd y. S protein-specific IgG levels (r = 0.717) correlated better with neutralizing activity than SARS coronavirus-specific IgG levels (r = 0.571).

Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of HRV positivity in a heterogeneous population of hospitalized children, compared to those positive for another respiratory virus and those where no respiratory virus was detected. METHODS: A retrospective caseCcontrol study of children hospitalized between January 2014 to April 2015 who had a respiratory viral specimen collected. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and baseline characteristics and clinical variables were compared. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 671 specimens obtained from 577 patients that were processed for the respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction assay, of which 198 were positive for HRV, 167 positive for another respiratory virus, and 306 where no respiratory virus was detected. A history of asthma was significantly associated with HRV-positive patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.71; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, HRV-positive patients had a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.44), lower rates of readmission (OR 0.53), and lower mortality (OR 0.35) compared to patients with no respiratory virus isolated; however, none were statistically significant. HRV-positive patients did have a significantly shorter length of stay (LOS) compared with patients with no respiratory virus isolated (differenceC0.35; P = 0.001). Similar outcomes were seen in patients positive for other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: HRV-positive hospitalized pediatric patients with a heterogeneous set of clinical diagnoses had higher association with asthma compared to patients who had another, or no, respiratory virus isolated. HRV-positive patients had shorter LOS compared to patients who had no respiratory viruses isolated. These findings suggest that HRV positivity in hospitalized pediatric patients may not lead to adverse clinical outcomes, although asthma is a risk factor regardless of clinical comorbidities and diagnoses.

PARTICIPANTS Five thousand six hindered and seventy two Medicare beneficiaries 65 and older (3,267 (55.8%) females). MEASUREMENTS A 40-item deficit accumulation FI was measured in 2011 and 2012, based on multidomain assessment including comorbidities, activities of daily living, physical tasks, cognition, and performance testing. We categorized 2011 FI into robust (FI < 0.15), pre-frail (FI = 0.15-0.24), mild frailty (FI = 0.25-0.34), and moderate to severe frailty (FI  0.35). Change in frailty was calculated as the FI change from 2011 to 2012, categorized as either absolute (>0.045 decrease, 0.015-0.045 decrease, 0.015 change, 0.015-0.045 increase, >0.045 increase) or proportional change (>20% decrease, 5-20% decrease, 5% change, 5-20% increase, 20% increase). We measured the association of FI change with 4-year mortality using Cox regression. RESULTS From 2011 to 2012, mean FI increased by 0.02 (standard deviation 0.07), with 58.6% having an increase. Over 4 years, 1,039 participants (13.6%) died. After adjusting for age and sex, compared to stable frailty (0.015), both absolute (>0.045) and proportional (>20%) increases in frailty were associated with higher mortality among pre-frail participants (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (1.45-3.79) and HR (95% CI) = 3.32 (1.76-6.26), respectively), participants with mild frailty (HR (95% CI) = 1.96 (1.35-2.85) and 2.03 (1.37-3.02)) and moderate or severe frailty (HR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.48-2.67) and 1.94 (1.43-2.63)) but not robust participants (HR (95% CI)= 1.48 (0.86-2.54), HR (95% CI) = 1.62 (0.80-3.28)). However, decreases in FI were not significantly associated with decreased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS Increasing deficit accumulation FI over 1 year is associated with increased mortality risk.

In this Account, we summarize recent advances in the chemical synthesis and implementation of activatable fluorescent probes to monitor the activity and the role of immune cells in different pathological processes, from infection to inflammatory diseases or cancer. In addition to the contributions that our group has made to this field, we review the most relevant literature disclosed over the past decade, providing examples of different activatable architectures and their application in diagnostics and drug discovery. This Account covers the imaging of the three major cell types in the immune system, that is, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Attracted by the tunability and target specificity of peptides, many groups have designed strategies based on fluorogenic peptides whose fluorescence emission is regulated by the reaction with enzymes (e.g., MMPs, cathepsins, granzymes), or through F?rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanisms. Selective imaging of immune cells has been also achieved by targeting different intracellular metabolic routes, such as lipid biogenesis. Other approaches involve the implementation of diversity-oriented fluorescence libraries or the use of environmentally sensitive fluorescent scaffolds (e.g., molecular rotors). Our group has made important progress by constructing probes to image metastasis-associated macrophages in tumors, apoptotic neutrophils, or cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells against cancer cells, among other examples. The chemical probes covered in this Account have been successfully validated in vitro in cell culture systems, and in vivo in relevant models of inflammation and cancer. Overall, the range of chemical structures and activation mechanisms reported to sense immune cell function is remarkable. However, the emergence of new strategies based on new molecular targets or activatable mechanisms that are yet to be discovered will open the door to track unexplored roles of immune cells in different biological systems. We anticipate that upcoming generations of activatable probes will find applications in the clinic to help assessing immunotherapies and advance precision medicine.

So far, transcriptomic analyses of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and cells were performed on mixed populations of infected and uninfected cells or using single-cell RNA sequencing, both leading to inaccurate or low-resolution gene expression interpretations. Moreover, they generally focused on annotated messenger RNAs (mRNAs), ignoring other transcripts, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and unannotated RNAs. Here, we performed deep polyA+ transcriptome analyses of lung epithelial A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, which were sorted based on the expression of the viral protein spike (S). To increase the sequencing depth and improve the robustness of the analysis, the samples were depleted of viral transcripts. Infection caused a massive reduction in mRNAs and lncRNAs, including transcripts coding for antiviral innate immune proteins, such as interferons (IFNs). This absence of IFN response probably explains the poor transcriptomic response of bystander cells co-cultured with spike positive (S+) ones. NF-{kappa}B and inflammatory response were among the pathways that escaped the global shutoff in S+ cells. In agreement with the RNA-seq analysis, inflammatory cytokines, but not IFNs, were produced and secreted by infected cells. Functional investigations revealed the proviral function of the NF-kB subunit p105/p50 and some of its known target genes, including IL32 and IL8, as well as the lncRNA ADIRF-AS1, which we identified as a novel NF-kB target gene.

In order to elucidate the exact role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) or RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling on immunogenicity and protective efficacy against influenza A virus infection (A/PR/8/34 [PR8]; H1N1), we adapted several innate signal-deficient mice (e.g., TRIF(-/-), MyD88(-/-), MyD88(-/-) TRIF(-/-), TLR3(-/-) TLR7(-/-), and IPS-1(-/-)). In this study, we found that MyD88 signaling was required for recruitment of CD11b(+) granulocytes, production of early inflammatory cytokines, optimal proliferation of CD4 T cells, and production of Th1 cytokines by T cells. However, PR8 virus-specific IgG and IgA antibody levels in both systemic and mucosal compartments were normal in TLR- and RLR-deficient mice. To further assess the susceptibility of these mice to influenza virus infection, protective efficacy was determined after primary or secondary lethal challenge.

Migrants in developing economies have been among the most affected. This vulnerable population faces a threat to their livelihood and way of life. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of pandemic on their lives to be able to tackle subsequent waves of the pandemic or similar exogenous shocks in future. PURPOSE: We delve into the economic and social disruptions caused by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on employment, sources of income, and lives of different categories of migrant labourers in the Indian state of Kerala. METHODS AND APPROACH: Using the livelihood portfolio theory, we dissect this impact in relation to a wide range of issues. This was corroborated by the in\\\\depth semi\\\\structured interviews with three categories of respondents. The interview data was analysed by using the directed qualitative content analysis method. We created themes from the data and juxtaposed them with the livelihood portfolio theory in addressing the research objectives. FINDINGS: Results highlight the impact on livelihood, lifestyles, migration prospects and gender aspects. First, the households dependent on international migrants were more severely affected than those with family members who were internal migrants. Second, a considerable lifestyle change (more reliance on a plant\\\\based diet) and borrowing patterns (more reliance on informal money lending) was reported. Third, opinions on future migration prospects were pessimistic, and a trend in favour of reverse migration was noted. We also captured the resilience measures for each of the themes. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: We find that blanket responses to mitigate migrants' hardships could be counterproductive. Policy\\\\makers ought to implement tailor\\\\made policies keeping in mind the migrants classification and socio\\\\economic demographics. Further, we recommend specific measures to address challenges that women face, to ease their workload and mitigate the loss of income. Specific measures aimed at initiating attitudinal change such as creating mental health awareness, curbing misinformation and providing counselling services could also add immense value in tackling the pandemic.","output":"Understanding the multifaceted impact of COVID\\\\19 on migrants in Kerala, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Characteristic chest computed tomography (CT) manifestation of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was added as a diagnostic criterion in the Chinese National COVID-19 management guideline Whether the characteristic findings of Chest CT could differentiate confirmed COVID-19 cases from other positive nucleic acid test (NAT)-negative patients has not been rigorously evaluated Purpose: We aim to test whether chest CT manifestation of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can be differentiated by a radiologist or a computer-based CT image analysis system Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study that included 52 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 80 non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients between 20 December, 2019 and 10 February, 2020 The chest CT images were evaluated by radiologists in a double blind fashion A computer-based image analysis system (uAI System, Lianying Inc , Shanghai, China) detected the lesions in 18 lung segments defined by Boyden classification system and calculated the infected volume in each segment The number and volume of lesions detected by radiologist and computer system was compared with Chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate Results: The main CT manifestations of COVID-19 were multi-lobar/segmental peripheral ground-glass opacities and patchy air space infiltrates The case and control groups were similar in demographics, comorbidity, and clinical manifestations There was no significant difference in eight radiologist identified CT image features between the two groups of patients There was also no difference in the absolute and relative volume of infected regions in each lung segment Conclusion: We documented the non-differentiating nature of initial chest CT image between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia with suspected symptoms Our results do not support CT findings replacing microbiological diagnosis as a critical criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis Our findings may prompt re-evaluation of isolated patients without laboratory confirmation","output":"Chest CT Images for COVID-19: Radiologists and Computer-Based Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited knowledge about the contagiosity and case fatality rate of COVID-19 as well as the still enigmatic route of transmission have led to strict limitations of non-emergency health care especially in head and neck medicine and dentistry.

However, intraoral innate immune mechanisms provide antiviral effects against a myriad of pathogenic viruses. Initial hints of their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are surfacing. It is hypothesized that intraoral immune system activity modulates the invasion pattern of SARS-CoV-2 into oral cells. Thus, the significance of intraoral tissues for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and persistence cannot be assessed. The underlying concept for this hypothesis was developed by the critical observation of a clinically asymptomatic COVID-19 patient.

Lung ultrasound is an imaging modality that is cost-effective, widely accessible, and can be used to diagnose acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19. It can be used to find important characteristics in the images, including A-lines, B-lines, consolidation, and pleural effusion, which all inform the clinician in monitoring and diagnosing the disease. With the use of portable ultrasound transducers, lung ultrasound images can be easily acquired, however, the images are often of poor quality. They often require an expert clinician interpretation, which may be time-consuming and is highly subjective. We propose a method for fast and reliable interpretation of lung ultrasound images by use of deep learning, based on the Kinetics-I3D network. Our learned model can classify an entire lung ultrasound scan obtained at point-of-care, without requiring the use of preprocessing or a frame-by-frame analysis. We compare our video classifier against ground truth classification annotations provided by a set of expert radiologists and clinicians, which include A-lines, B-lines, consolidation, and pleural effusion. Our classification method achieves an accuracy of 90% and an average precision score of 95% with the use of 5-fold cross-validation.

PARTICIPANTS: All in-patients with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and duration of admission. METHODS: We analysed factors associated with mortality using logistic regression and admission duration using Cox's regression, and described trends in frailty prevalence over time using linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 104 COVID-19 patients were admitted, 74% with moderate-to-severe frailty (clinical frailty score, CFS > 5). A total of 84 were discharged, 14 transferred to other hospitals, and six died on site. High C-reactive protein (CRP) > 50 mg/dL predicted 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 11.9, 95%CI 3.2C51.5, p < 0.001). Patients with CFS > 5 had a 10-day median admission, versus 7-day for CFS  5 and half the likelihood of discharge on a given day (adjusted hazard ratio 0.51, 95%CI 0.29C0.92, p = 0.024). CRP > 50 mg/dL and hospital-associated COVID-19 also predicted admission duration. As more frail patients had a lower rate of discharge, prevalence of CFS > 5 increased from 64% initially to 90% in the final week (non-zero slope p < 0.001).

DESIGN Diagnostic test evaluation. SAMPLE 60 mL of pooled urine from 4 dogs, divided into six 10-mL aliquots. PROCEDURES Urine aliquots were spiked with bacteria from 1 of 6 independent Escherichia coli cultures to achieve a target bacterial concentration of 10(5) CFUs/mL. One milliliter from each aliquot was transferred into 5 silicone-coated clot tubes (SCTs) and 5 urine transport tubes (UTTs). Samples were stored at 4C (39F) and 25C (77F) for 0, 8, and 24 hours, and then standard QBCs were performed. RESULTS Median bacterial concentration for urine samples stored in a UTT for 24 hours at 4C was lower than that for samples stored in an SCT under the same conditions. Conversely, a substantial decrease in median bacterial concentration was identified for samples stored for 24 hours in an SCT at 25C, compared with the median concentration for samples stored in a UTT under the same conditions. Median bacterial concentration in samples stored in an SCT at 25C for 24 hours (275 CFUs/mL) was less than the cutoff typically used to define clinically important bacteriuria by use of urine samples obtained via cystocentesis (ie, > 1,000 CFUs/mL).

A potential consequence of this form of treatment is the release of fugitive aerosols, both patient derived and medical, into the environment and the subsequent exposure of caregivers and bystanders to potential viral infections. This study examined the release of these fugitive aerosols during a standard aerosol therapy to a simulated adult patient. An aerosol holding chamber and mouthpiece were connected to a representative head model and breathing simulator. A combination of laser and Schlieren imaging was used to non-invasively visualize the release and dispersion of fugitive aerosol particles. Time-varying aerosol particle number concentrations and size distributions were measured with optical particle sizers at clinically relevant positions to the simulated patient. The influence of breathing pattern, normal and distressed, supplemental air flow, at 0.2 and 6 LPM, and the addition of a bacterial filter to the exhalation port of the mouthpiece were assessed. Images showed large quantities of fugitive aerosols emitted from the unfiltered mouthpiece. The images and particle counter data show that the addition of a bacterial filter limited the release of these fugitive aerosols, with the peak fugitive aerosol concentrations decreasing by 47.3C83.3%, depending on distance from the simulated patient. The addition of a bacterial filter to the mouthpiece significantly reduces the levels of fugitive aerosols emitted during a simulated aerosol therapy, p .05, and would greatly aid in reducing healthcare worker and bystander exposure to potentially harmful fugitive aerosols.","output":"Aerosol release, distribution, and prevention during aerosol therapy: a simulated model for infection control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The C preprocessor is widely used in practice.

This article presents in chronological order data that both individually (as received independently from multiple countries) and collectively urge studies that elucidate the following questions. 1.What animal species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the likely sources of infection, the period of infectivity, and transmissibility between these animals and to other animal species and humans? 2.What are the best diagnostic tests currently available for companion animals and livestock? 3.What expressions of illness in companion and other animal species can serve as disease markers? Although it is recognized that robust funding and methodology need to be identified to apply the best scientific investigation into these issues, there may be easily identifiable opportunities to capture information that can guide decision and study. First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers. If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created. Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients.

Of the respondents 971 (83.6%) rated their risk of infection as higher compared to other disciplines and 92.9% (na?= 1079) indicated they would be willing to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: The ophthalmologists interviewed consider their professional group to be exposed to an above-average risk of SARS-COV-2 infection compared to other disciplines. They frequently criticized the prioritization ranking of the German Ministry of Health (BMG), which deviated from the suggestions of the Standing Vaccination Committee of Germany (STIKO). The willingness to be vaccinated was very high among the surveyed German ophthalmologists.","output":"[Assessment of subjective risk of infection and willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 among German ophthalmologists : Results of a survey by DOG and BVA]./ Einsch?tzung des subjektiven Infektionsrisikos und Impfbereitschaft gegen SARS-CoV-2 unter deutschen Augen?rzten : Ergebnisse einer Umfrage von DOG und BVA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the effect of binder level on the physicochemical changes and tabletability of acetaminophen (APAP)-hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) granulated using twin-screw melt granulation. Even at 5% HPC level, the tablet tensile strength achieved up to 3.5 MPa. A minimum of 10% HPC was required for the process robustness. However, 20% HPC led to tabletability loss, attributable to the high mechanical strength of APAP granules. The over-granulated APAP granules had thick connected HPC scaffold and low porosity. Consequently, these granules were so strong that they underwent a lower degree of fracture under compression and higher elastic recovery during decompression. HPC was enriched on the surface of APAP extrudates at all HPC levels. Amorphous APAP was also observed on the extrudate surface at 20% HPC level, and it recrystallized within 24 h storage.

The second largest proportion of virus-related sequences infects plants and fungi, likely reflecting the diet of ingested insects, including members of the viral families Luteoviridae, Secoviridae, Tymoviridae, and Partitiviridae and the genus Sobemovirus. Bat guano viruses related to those infecting mammals comprised the third largest group, including members of the viral families Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Astroviridae, and Coronaviridae.

Phylogenetic analysis was used to clarify the relationship to known viral taxa of novel sequences detected in bat guano samples, showing that some guano viral sequences fall outside existing taxonomic groups. This initial characterization of the bat guano virome, the first metagenomic analysis of viruses in wild mammals using second-generation sequencing, therefore showed the presence of previously unidentified viral species, genera, and possibly families.

Locales in which efforts were undertaken to encourage distancing experienced reductions in their rate of transmission. However, these aggregate results tell us little about the effectiveness of social distancing at the level of the individual, which is the question addressed by the current research. Four months after participating in a study assessing their social distancing behavior, 2,120 participants indicated whether they had contracted COVID-19. Importantly, the assessment of social distancing involved not only a self-report measure of how strictly participants had followed social distancing recommendations but also a series of virtual behavior measures of social distancing. These simulations presented participants with graphical depictions mirroring specific real-world scenarios, asking them to position themselves in relation to others in the scene. Individuals' social distancing behavior, particularly as assessed by the virtual behavior measure, predicted whether they contracted COVID-19 during the intervening 4 mo. This was true when considering only participants who reported having tested positively for the virus and when considering additional participants who, although untested, believed that they had contracted the virus.

Although pharmacological treatment is generally well tolerated, 5%-20% of patients with hypertension are resistant to medical therapy, which is defined as blood pressure above goal (>140/90 mmHg in general; >130-139/80-85 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus; >130/80 mmHg in patients with chronic kidney disease) despite treatment with 3 antihypertensive drugs of different classes, including a diuretic, at optimal doses. These patients are at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular events, in particular stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, as compared with patients with nonresistant hypertension. The etiology of resistant hypertension is multifactorial and a number of risk factors have been identified. In addition, resistant hypertension might be due to secondary causes such as primary aldosteronism, chronic kidney disease, renal artery stenosis, or obstructive sleep apnea. To identify patients with resistant hypertension, the following must be excluded: pseudo-resistance, which might be due to nonadherence to medical treatment; white-coat effect; and inaccurate measurement technique. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the development and maintenance of hypertension by increasing renal renin release, decreasing renal blood flow, and enhancing tubular sodium retention. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) is a novel technique specifically targeting renal sympathetic nerves. Clinical trials have demonstrated that RDN significantly reduces blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. Experimental studies and small clinical studies indicate that RDN might also have beneficial effects in other diseases and comorbidities, characterized by increased sympathetic activity, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease.

The socioeconomic repercussions have fueled calls to lift these measures. In the absence of population-wide restrictions, isolation of infected individuals is key to curtailing transmission. However, the effectiveness of symptom-based isolation in preventing a resurgence depends on the extent of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We evaluate the contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission based on recent individual-level data regarding infectiousness prior to symptom onset and the asymptomatic proportion among all infections. We found that the majority of incidences may be attributable to silent transmission from a combination of the presymptomatic stage and asymptomatic infections. Consequently, even if all symptomatic cases are isolated, a vast outbreak may nonetheless unfold. We further quantified the effect of isolating silent infections in addition to symptomatic cases, finding that over one-third of silent infections must be isolated to suppress a future outbreak below 1% of the population. Our results indicate that symptom-based isolation must be supplemented by rapid contact tracing and testing that identifies asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases, in order to safely lift current restrictions and minimize the risk of resurgence.","output":"The implications of silent transmission for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family, is a respiratory disease that rapidly reached pandemic proportions with high morbidity and mortality In only a few months, it has had a dramatic impact on society and world economies COVID-19 has presented numerous challenges to all aspects of health care, including reliable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention Initial efforts to contain the spread of the virus were hampered by the time required to develop reliable diagnostic methods Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science with many applications for health care Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses deep learning with neural network algorithms It can recognize patterns and achieve complex computational tasks often far quicker and with increased precision than can humans METHODS: In this article, we explore the potential for the simple and widely available chest X-ray (CXR) to be used with AI to diagnose COVID-19 reliably Microsoft CustomVision is an automated image classification and object detection system that is a part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services We utilized publicly available CXR images for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia from other etiologies, and normal CXRs as a dataset to train Microsoft CustomVision RESULTS: Our trained model overall demonstrated 92 9% sensitivity (recall) and positive predictive value (precision), with results for each label showing sensitivity and positive predictive value at 94 8% and 98 9% for COVID-19 pneumonia, 89% and 91 8% for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, 95% and 88 8% for normal lung We then validated the program using CXRs of patients from our institution with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses along with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXRs Our model performed with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 97% accuracy, 91% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value CONCLUSIONS: We have used a readily available, commercial platform to demonstrate the potential of AI to assist in the successful diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR images The findings have implications for screening and triage, initial diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and identifying patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality Based on the data, a website was created to demonstrate how such technologies could be shared and distributed to others to combat entities such as COVID-19 moving forward","output":"Using Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Chest X-ray Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid expansion of a countrys economy is highly dependent on timely product distribution, which is hampered by terrible traffic congestion. Additional staff are also required to follow the delivery vehicle while it transports documents or records to another destination. This study proposes Delicar, a self-driving product delivery vehicle that can drive the vehicle on the road and report the current geographical location to the authority in real-time through a map. The equipped camera module captures the road image and transfers it to the computer via socket server programming. The raspberry pi sends the camera image and waits for the steering angle value. The image is fed to the pre-trained deep learning model that predicts the steering angle regarding that situation. Then the steering angle value is passed to the raspberry pi that directs the L298 motor driver which direction the wheel should follow. Based upon this direction, L298 decides either forward or left or right or backwards movement. The 3-cell 12V LiPo battery handles the power supply to the raspberry pi and L298 motor driver. A buck converter regulates a 5V 3A power supply to the raspberry pi to be working. Nvidia CNN architecture has been followed, containing nine layers including five convolution layers and three dense layers to develop the steering angle predictive model.

Although extremely useful in many tasks, most models have performed poorly in forecasting the pandemic peaks. We investigate this common pitfall by forecasting four countries' pandemic peak: Austria, Germany, Italy, and South Korea. Far from the peaks, our models can forecast the pandemic dynamics 20 days ahead. Nevertheless, when calibrating our models close to the day of the pandemic peak, all forecasts fail. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis revealed the main obstacle: the misestimation of the transmission rate. Inverse uncertainty quantification has shown that significant changes in transmission rate commonly precede a peak. These changes are a key factor in forecasting the pandemic peak. Long forecasts of the pandemic peak are therefore undermined by the lack of models that can forecast changes in the transmission rate, i.e., how a particular society behaves, changes of mitigation policies, or how society chooses to respond to them. In addition, our studies revealed that even short forecasts of the pandemic peak are challenging. Backward projections have shown us that the correct estimation of any temporal change in the transmission rate is only possible many days ahead. Our results suggest that the distance between a change in the transmission rate and its correct identification in the curve of active infected cases can be as long as 15 days. This is intrinsic to the phenomenon and how it affects epidemic data: a new case is usually only reported after an incubation period followed by a delay associated with the test. In summary, our results suggest the phenomenon itself challenges the task of forecasting the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when only epidemic data is available. Nevertheless, we show that exciting results can be obtained when using the same models to project different scenarios of reduced transmission rates. Therefore, our results highlight that mathematical modeling can help control COVID-19 pandemic by backward projections that characterize the phenomena' essential features and forward projections when different scenarios and strategies can be tested and used for decision-making.","output":"The Quixotic Task of Forecasting Peaks of COVID-19: Rather Focus on Forward and Backward Projections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reviews the activity undertaken between a teaching hospital and its adjacent Independent Hospital and its implementation under the Independent Sector Provider Contract between NHSE and the Independent Sector.

Few have looked into the issue that gastrointestinal (GI) procedures may produce an abundance of aerosols. The current process of risk management for clinics is to follow a clinic-specific HVAC formula, which is typically calculated once-a-year and assume perfect mixing of the air within the space, to determine how many minutes each procedural room refreshes 99% of its air between procedures when doors are closed. This formula is not designed to fit the complex dynamic of small airborne particle transport and deposition that can potentially carry the virus in clinical conditions. It results in reduced procedure throughput as well as an excess of idle time in clinics that process a large number of short procedures such as outpatient GI centers. We present and tested a new cyber-physical system that continuously monitors airborne particle counts in procedural rooms and also at the same time it automatically monitors the procedural rooms' state and flexible endoscope status without interfering with the clinic's workflow. We use our data gathered from over 1500 GI cases in one clinical suite to understand the correlation between air quality and standard procedure types as well as identify the risks involved with any HVAC system in a clinical suite environment. Thanks to this system, we demonstrate that standard GI procedures generate large quantities of aerosols, which can potentially promote viral airborne transmission among patients and healthcare staff.

Every second year since 2004, the examinations are expanded in six study regions using a cross-sectional survey design (GME). However, the extent to which the results of the GME surveys are generalizable to the SEU population is unknown. Therefore, this study carried out a poststratification of two different GME surveys. The aim was to observe the impact of poststratification on an exemplary analysis of influencing factors for three allergy and asthma related outcomes (hay fever, asthma, wheezing) and thus to better understand this important question. METHODS: First, poststratification was applied to correct for deviances of the GME sample in comparison to the SEU population. Logistic regression was used to determine the auxiliary variables for the poststratification. Following this, a composite variable as a linear combination was created to calculate weighting factors. Next, logistic regression analyses were applied to analyze possible influencing factors for three allergy and asthma related outcomes (hay fever, asthma and wheezing) in two GME surveys (2005/2006 and 2012/2013). Subsequently, the differences arising from poststratification were examined in more detail. RESULTS: This study supports the hypothesis that the GME sample deviates from the SEU population. Mother tongue other than German of at least one parent, complete vaccination status and conspicuous visuomotor test results were positively associated with participation in both GME surveys. The prevalence for hay fever, asthma and frequent wheeze did not change statistically significant from 2005/2006 to 2012/2013. In the twelve analyses before and after poststratification, male sex was statistically significant associated with the three allergy and asthma related outcomes (e.g. asthma 2005/2006 after poststratification, aOR: 2.06, 95%-CI: 1.56-2.71). A high body mass index was positively associated with asthma (e.g. 2005/2006 after poststratification, aOR: 1.12, 95%-CI: 1.05-1.20). Poststratification caused a significant change in the sample composition. CONCLUSIONS: It might be suggested that a poststratification should be performed for each GME survey. Poststratification tended to make results more comparable with previous research.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to measure the trends and assess factors affecting health information technology (HIT) use among members of the US population with and without cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: We used serial cross-sectional data from the National Health Interview Survey for the years 2012-2018 to assess trends in HIT use among adults, stratified by age and cardiovascular risk factor status. We developed multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance status, marital status, geographic region, and perceived health status to assess the likelihood of HIT use among patients with and without cardiovascular disease risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 14,304 (44.6%) and 14,644 (58.7%) participants reported using HIT in 2012 and 2018, respectively. When comparing the rates of HIT use for the years 2012 and 2018, among participants without cardiovascular risk factors, the HIT use proportion increased from 51.1% to 65.8%; among those with one risk factor, it increased from 43.9% to 59%; and among those with more than one risk factor, it increased from 41.3% to 54.7%. Increasing trends in HIT use were highest among adults aged >65 years (annual percentage change [APC] 8.3%), who had more than one cardiovascular risk factor (APC 5%) and among those who did not graduate from high school (APC 8.8%). Likelihood of HIT use was significantly higher in individuals who were younger, female, and non-Hispanic White; had higher education and income; were married; and reported very good or excellent health status. In 2018, college graduates were 7.18 (95% CI 5.86-8.79), 6.25 (95% CI 5.02-7.78), or 7.80 (95% CI 5.87-10.36) times more likely to use HIT compared to adults without high school education among people with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, one cardiovascular risk factor, or no cardiovascular risk factors, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Over 2012-2018, HIT use increased nationally, with greater use noted among younger and higher educated US adults.

DESIGN This was a cohort study using surveys in a random sample of Australians participating in an Australian Health Report series, supported by Pfizer. This article focuses on perceptions about menopause of 710 women. RESULTS Peri- and postmenopausal women experienced more fatigue, sleeplessness, fluid retention, and bloating than premenopausal women expected to experience. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women rated menopause as the \\"first day of the rest of [my] life\\" significantly more than premenopausal women. All women perceived that menopause had an impact on aging and weight gain, but more premenopausal women feared loss of sexuality (55%), loss of femininity (39%), and the inability to have more children (37%). Perceptions of illnesses differed from actual incidence, with 27% of all women perceiving breast cancer and 11% perceiving heart disease as a health risk, compared with actual female mortality figures of 3% and 41%, respectively. Perceptions of the effects of hormone therapy were inaccurate, with 53% of all women expecting a reduction in hot flushes, 44% expecting that hormone therapy increased breast cancer, and 23% expecting that hormone therapy decreased fractures. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests a difference between perceptions of symptoms, fears, risks of future illnesses, and side effects of symptomatic treatments at menopause and actual experience. Because risk perception influences health-related behaviors, visits to healthcare providers, and treatment decisions and can be modified through education, an understanding of risk perception is clinically important.

Understanding the characteristics of health misinformation can be a premise for rebuking and purposefully correcting such misinformation on social media. METHODS: Using samples of Chinas misinformation on social media related to the COVID-19 outbreak (N=547), the objective of this article was to illustrate the characteristics of said misinformation on social media in China by descriptive analysis, including the typology, the most-mentioned information, and a developmental timeline. RESULTS: The results reveal that misinformation related to preventive and therapeutic methods is the most-mentioned type. Other types of misinformation associated with peoples daily lives are also widespread. Moreover, cultural and social beliefs have an impact on the perception and propaganda of misinformation, and changes in the crisis situation are relevant to the type variance of misinformation. CONCLUSION: Following research results, strategies of health communication for managing misinformation on social media are given, such as credible sources and expert sources. Also, traditional beliefs or perceptions play the vital role in health communication. To sum up, combating misinformation on social media is likely not a single effort to correct misinformation or to prevent its spread. Instead, scholars, journalists, educators, and citizens must collaboratively identify and correct any misinformation.","output":"Characteristics of Misinformation Spreading on Social Media During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: A Descriptive Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, online testing has become an increasingly important instrument in developmental research, in particular since the COVID-19 pandemic made in-lab testing impossible. However, online testing comes with two substantial challenges. First, it is unclear how valid results of online studies really are. Second, implementing online studies can be costly and/or require profound coding skills. This article addresses the validity of an online testing approach that is low-cost and easy to implement: The experimenter shares test materials such as videos or presentations via video chat and interactively moderates the test session. To validate this approach, we compared childrens performance on a well-established task, the change-of-location false belief task, in an in-lab and online test setting. In two studies, 3- and 4-year-old received online implementations of the false belief version (Study 1) and the false and true belief version of the task (Study 2). Childrens performance in these online studies was compared to data of matching tasks collected in the context of in-lab studies. Results revealed that the typical developmental pattern of performance in these tasks found in in-lab studies could be replicated with the novel online test procedure.

It can be transmitted by mosquitoes, inhalation or physical contact with the body fluids of infected animals. Severe clinical cases are characterized by acute hepatitis with hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis and/or retinitis. The dynamics of RVFV infection and the cell types infected in vivo are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: RVFV strains expressing humanized Renilla luciferase (hRLuc) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated and inoculated to susceptible Ifnar1-deficient mice. We investigated the tissue tropism in these mice and the nature of the target cells in vivo using whole-organ imaging and flow cytometry. After intraperitoneal inoculation, hRLuc signal was observed primarily in the thymus, spleen and liver. Macrophages infiltrating various tissues, in particular the adipose tissue surrounding the pancreas also expressed the virus. The liver rapidly turned into the major luminescent organ and the mice succumbed to severe hepatitis. The brain remained weakly luminescent throughout infection. FACS analysis in RVFV-GFP-infected mice showed that the macrophages, dendritic cells and granulocytes were main target cells for RVFV. The crucial role of cells of the monocyte/macrophage/dendritic lineage during RVFV infection was confirmed by the slower viral dissemination, decrease in RVFV titers in blood, and prolonged survival of macrophage- and dendritic cell-depleted mice following treatment with clodronate liposomes. Upon dermal and nasal inoculations, the viral dissemination was primarily observed in the lymph node draining the injected ear and in the lungs respectively, with a significant increase in survival time. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal the high levels of phagocytic cells harboring RVFV during viral infection in Ifnar1-deficient mice.

A descriptive cross-sectional study of the Ebola virus disease alerts which were reported in South Sudan from August 2018 to November 2019 was conducted using both quantitative and qualitative methods. As of 30 November 2019, a total of 107 alerts had been detected in the country out of which 51 (47.7%) met the case definition and were investigated with blood samples collected for laboratory confirmation. Most (81%) of the investigated alerts were South Sudanese nationals. The alerts were identified by health workers (53.1%) at health facilities, at the community (20.4%) and by screeners at the points of entry (12.2%). Most of the investigated alerts were detected from the high-risk states of Gbudwe (46.9%), Jubek (16.3%) and Torit (10.2%).

In deuterostomes, the surface ectoderm and the anterior part of the archenteron are reconfigured and reconnected to make a mouth opening. This study of the larval development of the larvacean, Oikopleura dioica, investigates the cellular organization of the oral region, the developmental processes of the mouth, and the formation of associated sensory cells. O. dioica is a simple chordate whose larvae are transparent and have a small number of constituent cells. It completes organ morphogenesis in 7 h, between hatching 3 h after fertilization and the juvenile stage at 10 h, when it attains adult form and starts to feed. It has two types of mechanosensory cell embedded in the oral epithelium, which is a single layer of cells. There are twenty coronal sensory cells in the circumoral nerve ring and two dorsal sensory organ cells. Two bilateral lip precursor cells (LPCs), facing the anterior surface, divide dorsoventrally and make a wedge-shaped cleft between the two daughter cells named the dorsal lip cell (DLC) and the ventral lip cell (VLC). Eventually, the DLC and VLC become detached and separated into dorsal and ventral lips, triggering mouth opening. This is an intriguing example of cell division itself contributing to morphogenesis. The boundary between the ectoderm and endoderm is present between the lip cells and coronal sensory cells. All oral sensory cells, including dorsal sensory organ cells, were of endodermal origin and were not derived from the ectodermal placode.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of patients with COVID-19 with acute hypoxic respiratory failure according to pulmonary impairment in the awake-prone position, outside of the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted on COVID-19 patients under noninvasive respiratory support. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained for each patient before the treatment and after they were placed in the awake-prone position. To identify responders and non-responders after the first prone maneuver, receiver operating characteristic curves with sensitivity and specificity of the PaO(2)/FiO(2) and SpO(2)/FiO(2) indices were analyzed. The maneuver was considered positive if the patient did not require endotracheal intubation for ventilatory assistance. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included, and 64.6% were categorized as responders. The SpO(2)/FiO(2) index was effective for predicting endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients regardless of lung parenchymal damage (area under the curve 0.84, cutoff point 165, sensitivity 85%, specificity 75%). Responders had better outcomes with lower hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.107, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.012-0.93) and a shorter length of stay (median difference 6 days, HR=0.30, 95% CI: 0.13-0.66) after adjusting for age, body mass index, sex, and comorbidities.

Phylogenetically, novel E. bieneusi genotype SH_deer1 fell into group 6, and the other genotypes were assigned to group 1 with zoonotic potential. Three novel Cryptosporidium genotypes (Cryptosporidium avian genotype V-like and C. galli-like 1 and 2) were identified, C. galli-like 1 and 2 formed a clade that was distinct from Cryptosporidium species. The genetic distinctiveness of these two novel genotypes suggests that they represent a new species of Cryptosporidium. Zoonotic assemblage A (n = 36) and host-adapted assemblages C (n = 1) and E (n = 7) of G. duodenalis were characterized. The overall results suggest that wildlife act as host reservoirs carrying zoonotic E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis, potentially enabling transmission from wildlife to humans and other animals.","output":"Wildlife Is a Potential Source of Human Infections of Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Giardia duodenalis in Southeastern China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aim to determine the psychological status of medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak and civil war in Libya. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students from 15 medical schools between April 20 and May 1, 2020. The demographic characteristics, generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) results were collected. RESULTS: Of the 3,500 students, 2,430 completed the survey. The mean ( SD) score of anxiety symptoms determined by the GAD-7 was 7.2 (5.1). A total of 268 (11%) students had a GAD-7 score of 15, which is indicative of moderate to severe anxiety. A total of 1,568 (64.5%) students showed different degrees of anxiety: mild, 910 (37.5%); moderate, 390 (16%); and severe, 268 (11%). Anxiety was significantly associated with living status and internal displacement (P < 0.05). The mean (+ SD) score of depressive symptoms determined by the PHQ-9 was 9.7 (6.3). A total of 525 (21.6%) students had a PHQ-9 score of 15, which is indicative of moderate to severe depression. A total of 1,896 (88%) students were diagnosed with mild (PHQ  5) depression. Suicidal ideation was present in 552 patients (22.7%). Depression was only statistically associated with the year of study (P = 0.009).

Circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA may represent a more reliable indicator of infection than nasal RNA, but quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) lacks diagnostic sensitivity for blood samples. METHODS. A CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR assay that sensitively detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA was employed to analyze viral RNA kinetics in longitudinal plasma samples from nonhuman primates (NHPs) after virus exposure;to evaluate the utility of blood SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in adults cases confirmed by nasal/ nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR results;and to identify suspected COVID-19 cases in pediatric and at-risk adult populations with negative nasal swab RT-qPCR results. All blood samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR to allow direct comparisons. RESULTS. CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the plasma of experimentally infected NHPs from 1 to 28 days after infection, and these increases preceded and correlated with rectal swab viral RNA increases. In a patient cohort (n = 159), this blood-based assay demonstrated 91.2% diagnostic sensitivity and 99.2% diagnostic specificity versus a comparator RT-qPCR nasal/nasopharyngeal test, whereas RT-qPCR exhibited 44.1% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity for the same blood samples. This CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR assay also accurately identified patients with COVID-19 using one or more negative nasal swab RT-qPCR results. CONCLUSION. Results of this study indicate that sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood by CRISPR-augmented RT-PCR permits accurate COVID-19 diagnosis, and can detect COVID-19 cases with transient or negative nasal swab RT-qPCR results, suggesting that this approach could improve COVID-19 diagnosis and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 infection clearance, and predict the severity of infection.

The quarantine condition imposed due to the extensive spread of coronavirus has, in the medium and long term, inevitable repercussions on many psychopathological states characterized by anxiety-depressive symptoms. For children, however, the impact of the traumatic context has different importance and outcomes, depending on their cognitive capacity and emotional competence. When children are experiencing a quarantine period in a state of world emergency such as the current one, his or her ability to manage the cognitive capacity and emotional competence adaptively and functionally has an essential significance. They may also perceive the experience as traumatic or not, through Reflective Function and Affect Mirroring with parents. Family experiences, care, and parenting are formative and preparatory to cope with the many events that life presents. It, therefore, becomes essential to establish in the family a climate of support and containment that facilitates the restructuring of the phenomenon and exorcises the stress arising from the event itself and contributes to the development of agency and resilience skills. ? 2020, Scientific Publishers of India.

In response, the US government, utilizing the Defense Production Act ordered the development of 200,000 ventilators from 11 different manufacturers. These ventilators have different capabilities and it is not evident whether all are able to support COVID-19 patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: Evaluate ventilator requirements for affected COVID-19 patients, assess the clinical performance of current SNS ventilators employed during the pandemic, and finally compare ordered ventilators functionality based on COVID-19 patient needs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Current published literature, publicly available documents, and lay press articles were reviewed by a diverse team of disaster experts. Data was assembled into tabular format which formed the basis for analysis and future recommendations. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients often develop severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure and ARDS requiring high levels of ventilator support. Current SNS ventilators were unable to fully support all COVID-19 patients, and only about half of newly ordered ventilators have the capacity to support the most severely affected patients; ventilators with less capacity for providing high level support are still of significant value in caring for many patients.

The parameters of the flight mechanism are estimated using published experimental data which are also used to validate the mathematical model. Incorporating the flapping mechanism friction losses into the mathematical model enables capturing the physics of the problem with higher accuracy, which is not possible with simpler models.

Moreover, the model enabled evaluations of the effects of adding bioinspired elastic elements on the efficiency of the system. Although it is established through experimental studies that the addition of a bioinspired elastic element can improve system efficiency and increase lift generation, the existing mathematical models fail to model and predict such effects.

Limited pharmacokinetic studies indicate that remdesivir concentrations in serum decrease quickly after dosing, so its primary serum metabolite GS-441524 may have more analytical utility. OBJECTIVES: We developed and validated a method to quantify remdesivir, its metabolite GS-441524 and dexamethasone in human serum. METHODS: We used LC-MS/MS and applied the method to 23 serum samples from seven patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The method has limits of detection of 0.0375 ng/mL for remdesivir, 0.375 ng/mL for GS-441524 and 3.75 ng/mL for dexamethasone. We found low intra-patient variability, but significant inter-patient variability, in remdesivir, GS-441524 and dexamethasone levels.

Background: Previous studies have reported a lower severity of COVID-19 infections at higher altitudes; however, this association may be confounded by various factors. We examined the association between living at altitude and COVID-19 mortality in Peru adjusting for population density, prevalence of comorbidities, indicators of socioeconomic status, and health care access. Methods: Utilizing administrative data across 196 provinces located at varying altitudes (sea level to 4,373 m), we conducted a two-stage analysis of COVID-19 deaths between March 19 and December 31, 2020, Peru's first wave. We first calculated cumulative daily mortality rate for each province and fit lognormal cumulative distribution functions to estimate total mortality rate, and start, peak, and duration of the first wave. We then regressed province-level total mortality rate, start, peak, and duration of the first wave as a function of altitude adjusted for confounders. Results: There were 93,528 recorded deaths from COVID-19 (mean age 66.5 years, 64.5% male) for a cumulative mortality of 272.5 per 100,000 population between March 19 and December 31, 2020.

The article provides perspectives on current and future challenges as well as research needs for selected key topics. While this paper is not an exhaustive review of all research areas in the field of air quality, we have selected key topics that we feel are important from air quality research and policy perspectives. After providing a short historical overview, this review focuses on improvements in characterizing sources and emissions of air pollution, new air quality observations and instrumentation, advances in air quality prediction and forecasting, understanding interactions of air quality with meteorology and climate, exposure and health assessment, and air quality management and policy. In conducting the review, specific objectives were (i) to address current developments that push the boundaries of air quality research forward, (ii) to highlight the emerging prominent gaps of knowledge in air quality research, and (iii) to make recommendations to guide the direction for future research within the wider community. This review also identifies areas of particular importance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference on Air Quality 2020 (held online due to the COVID 19 restrictions during 18C26 May 2020), but the article incorporates a wider landscape of research literature within the field of air quality science. On air pollution emissions the review highlights, in particular, the need to reduce uncertainties in emissions from diffuse sources, particulate matter chemical components, shipping emissions, and the importance of considering both indoor and outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are regulated by guidelines. Connecting various physical scales in air quality modelling is still a continual issue, with cities being affected by air pollution gradients at local scales and by long-range transport. At the same time, one should allow for the impacts from climate change on a longer timescale. Earth system modelling offers considerable potential by providing a consistent framework for treating scales and processes, especially where there are significant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology. Assessment of exposure to air pollution should consider the impacts of both indoor and outdoor emissions, as well as application of more sophisticated, dynamic modelling approaches to predict concentrations of air pollutants in both environments. With particulate matter being one of the most important pollutants for health, research is indicating the urgent need to understand, in particular, the role of particle number and chemical components in terms of health impact, which in turn requires improved emission inventories and models for predicting high-resolution distributions of these metrics over cities. The review also examines how air pollution management needs to adapt to the above-mentioned new challenges and briefly considers the implications from the COVID-19 pandemic for air quality.

While clinical reports from China to date demonstrate that the majority of cases remain relatively mild and recover with supportive care, it is also crucial to be well prepared for severe cases warranting intensive care. Initiating appropriate infection control measures may not always be achievable in primary care or in acute-care settings. Case A 45-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe pneumonia, later confirmed as COVID-19. His initial evaluation in the resuscitation room and treatments in the intensive care unit was performed under droplet and contact precaution with additional airborne protection using the N95 respirator mask. He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days and was discharged on hospital day 24. Conclusions Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit. However, severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, or another novel infectious disease, could present at any moment and would be a continuing challenge to pursue appropriate measures.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of endorectal ultrasound in predicting the pathologic circumferential resection margin in low rectal anterior tumors and to compare it with MRI findings. DESIGN This was a prospective series comparing the preoperative circumferential resection margin assessed by endorectal ultrasound and MRI with pathologic examination. SETTINGS The study was conducted by a specialized colorectal multidisciplinary team at a tertiary teaching hospital. PATIENTS Between 2002 and 2008, 76 patients with mid to low rectal cancer were preoperatively evaluated by endorectal ultrasound and MRI and underwent total mesorectal excision without neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Twenty-seven patients with posterior or postero-lateral tumors were excluded, leaving 49 patients with anterior or antero-lateral tumors for the present subanalysis. We compared preoperative circumferential resection margin status using endorectal ultrasound and MRI with pathologic examination. INTERVENTIONS We conducted a comparison between preoperative circumferential resection margin status and pathologic examination after total mesorectal excision surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Accuracy in predicting pathologic circumferential resection margin status was measured. RESULTS Overall accuracy of endorectal ultrasound and MRI in assessing circumferential resection margin status was 83.7% and 91.8%, with negative predictive values of 97.2% and 97.5%. When focusing on low rectal tumors, the overall accuracy of endorectal ultrasound increased to 87.5%, whereas the accuracy of MRI decreased to 87.5%, with a negative predictive value of 95.6% for both diagnostic tests.

It is emphasized that the recession was triggered mainly by temporary restrictions on social contacts and mobility that were external to the economy. For Russia, it was aggravated by discords among the OPEC+ members. It is established that the 2020 drop of economic activity turned out to be unprecedentedly deep and unprecedentedly short, in some cases even less than one quarter. Compared to other countries, Russia passed the crisis quite successfully, although the size of the Russian stimulus package was much smaller than in the most developed countries. It is noticed that around the world quite fast recovery began immediately after the mitigation of lockdowns. Relatively recent data allowed us to conclude that by mid-2021, most emerging economies, including Russia, had reached pre-pandemic levels. It is shown that most forecasts agree that in 2021 (and partly in 2022) there will be an accelerated recovery and then the main macroeconomic indicators will return to pre-recession trajectories.

This study aimed to report clinical outcomes of manual aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke refractory to SBT. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical and angiographic data of 30 patients who underwent MAT with a Penumbra reperfusion catheter because of refractory occlusion after SBT with a Solitaire stent as first-line endovascular therapy. Refractory occlusion was defined by a lack of successful revascularization (defined as Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2b) after five retrieval attempts. A good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 2 at 3 months. RESULTS Successful revascularization was achieved in 83.3% (25/30) of the patients who underwent MAT after failed SBT. There was no arterial rupture or dissection or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Two embolic occlusions in a new arterial territory and five subarachnoid hemorrhages occurred, neither of which caused neurological worsening. At the 3-month follow-up, 36.7% (11/30) of patients exhibited a good outcome. The mortality rate was 6.7% (2/30) at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that MAT with the Penumbra reperfusion catheter can further increase the revascularization rate without serious complications in patients with acute stroke with refractory occlusions after SBT with a Solitaire stent.","output":"Outcomes of manual aspiration thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke refractory to stent-based thrombectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel service oriented platform has been developed under the framework of the Telerehabilitation Service funded by the Cross Border Cooperation Programme Greece Cyprus 2007 C 2013 to support tele-supervised exercise rehabilitation for patients after hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU).

CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old male hospital doctor of presented to the Early Inflammatory Arthritis clinic with a four-week history of acute onset joint pain, swelling and early morning stiffness in excess of two hours. The symptoms began at the left ankle with Achilles tendonitis but progressed over the following 72 hours to a symmetrical polyarthritis affecting the wrists, proximal interphalangeal joints, shoulders, elbows, and knees. Approximately five weeks prior to the onset of his joint symptoms he had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with six days of fever, non-productive cough, and fatigue. He did not require hospitalisation. His past medical history was significant for biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. There was no prior history of inflammatory arthritis and no personal or family history of skin psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease or uveitis. There was no preceding genitourinary or gastrointestinal upset. His family history was significant for a sister with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis for which she was taking sulfasalazine. Examination revealed a normal BMI, synovitis at the wrists and proximal interphalangeal joints without evidence of joint effusion in the large joints. Blood tests revealed elevations in the ESR (83 mm/hour, reference range 0-10 mm/hour) and CRP (25mg/dL, reference range <5mg/dL). Serology was negative for the rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and an extractable nuclear antigen panel. Radiographs of the affected joints were unremarkable. Serological testing was positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. He was started on oral Prednisolone 20mg daily and an NSAID with good symptomatic response and normalisation of his ESR (5mm/hour) and CRP (<1mg/dL). The course of prednisolone was tapered over a 6-week period and he is still in steroid free remission with normal inflammatory markers at follow up. The patient was given a diagnosis of a post-viral reactive arthritis which was attributed to the preceding COVID-19 illness. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Post infectious inflammatory arthritis has been described with many viral infections including: hepatitis virus, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, rubella, alphavirus (including Chikungunya), flavivirus (including Zika), herpes viruses (including Epstein-Barr virus), varicella, cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interestingly, viral arthritis has not been reported in influenza and human coronaviruses (including SARS and MERS). Arthralgia was reported in 14.9% of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases in China during the early phases of the pandemic but inflammatory arthritis was not well described. The clinical course of the inflammatory arthritis in this case was self-limiting with enthesitis and synovitis resolving within six weeks of onset with the mainstay of treatment being symptomatic relief in the form of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Patient perspective: When I woke up that Tuesday morning with severe joint pains and stiffness, I knew something was not right. It was not like anything I have felt before in terms of my joints, having had sports injuries in the past. It was to the point where I was even struggling to go from sitting to standing. Without Prednisolone, I feel as if I would not have been able to work and may even have been house bound. I was relieved that this inflammatory arthritis did respond to Prednisolone. After six weeks of taking Prednisolone, the condition seemed to settle.

A range of studies and reports into the health and wellbeing of young people have recommended that they should be consulted and engaged in developing public health policy and prevention strategies. There are, however, very few opportunities for young people to have a say about gambling issues, with little consideration of their voices in public health recommendations related to gambling. This study aimed to address this gap by documenting young peoples perceptions about strategies that could be used to counter the normalisation of gambling and prevent gambling related harm. METHODS: This study took a critical qualitative inquiry approach, which acknowledges the role of power and social injustice in health issues. Qualitative interviews, using a constructivist approach, were conducted with 54 young people (11C17 years) in Australia. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. RESULTS: Five overall strategies were constructed from the data. 1) Reducing the accessibility and availability of gambling products; 2) Changing gambling infrastructure to help reduce the risks associated with gambling engagement; 3) Untangling the relationship between gambling and sport; 4) Restrictions on advertising; and 5) Counter-framing in commercial messages about gambling. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that young people have important insights and provide recommendations for addressing factors that may contribute to the normalisation of gambling, including strategies to prevent gambling related harm. Young people hold similar views to public health experts about strategies aimed at de-normalising gambling in their local communities and have strong opinions about the need for gambling to be removed from sport.","output":"Young people in Australia discuss strategies for preventing the normalisation of gambling and reducing gambling harm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Globally, the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a high risk for Healthcare Workers (HCWs) who are among the population that is most vulnerable of being infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). With a prevailing pandemic such as COVID-19, it becomes important to understand the presence and persistence of antibodies in the serum of HCW, testing positive for COVID-19 on Reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). An understanding of the prevalence of IgG antibodies against COVID-19 and the duration for which they are present in the serum will help in predicting the immune response of individuals against the disease. Aim: To study the prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibodies in laboratory confirmed COVID-19 RT-PCR positive symptomatic, asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative subjects. Materials and Methods: The present longitudinal study was conducted from April 2020 to December 2020 with a sample size of 90 participants based on a pilot study. Blood sample was collected and serum was separated. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was done to detect the presence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in serum. Chi-square test and Pearson correlation were used to find out the statistical significance of COVID-19 IgG antibodies in COVID-19 positive and negative HCWs and the relationship between Cycle threshold values (Ct) and antibody levels, respectively. Results: Fever with sore throat was the most common (33%) symptom. Chi-square test done to compare IgG among RT-PCR positive and negative subjects showed p-value of &lt;0.00001 which was significant. However, statistical significance was not found (p-value 0.9973) with respect to COVID-19 IgG antibodies in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. Mean antibody index in symptomatic and asymptomatic was 3.77431.9834 and 3.5711.7961, respectively. Average number of days, the antibodies persisted was 25 days-266 days. Conclusion: The prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among RT-PCR positive symptomatic, asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative subjects was 88%, 67% and 27%, respectively. The maximum number of days antibodies persisted was 266 days.

In recent years, studies on coronaviruses have gained a momentum due to coronavirus outbreaks. Mutations in coronaviruses can result in deadly diseases in new hosts (such as SARS-CoV-2) or cause changes in organ-tissue affinity, as occurred with feline infectious peritonitis virus, exacerbating their pathogenesis. In recent studies on different types of CCoV, the pantropic strains characterized by hypervirulent and multi-systemic infections are believed to be emerging, in contrast to classical enteric coronavirus infections. In this study, we investigated emerging hypervirulent and multi-systemic CCoV strains using molecular and bioinformatic analysis, and examined differences between enteric and pantropic CCoV strains at the phylogenetic level. RT-PCR was performed with specific primers to identify the coronavirus M (membrane) and S (spike) genes, and samples were then subjected to DNA sequencing. In phylogenetic analysis, four out of 26 samples were classified as CCoV-1. The remaining 22 samples were all classified as CCoV-2a. In the CCoV-2a group, six samples were in branches close to enteric strains, and 16 samples were in the branches close to pantropic strains. Enteric and pantropic strains were compared by molecular genotyping of CCoV in dogs. Phylogenetic analysis of hypervirulent pantropic strains was carried out at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence levels. CCoV was found to be divergent from the original strain. This implies that some CCoV strains have become pantropic strains that cause multisystemic infections, and they should not be ruled out as the cause of severe diarrhea and multisystemic infections.","output":"Molecular characterization of canine coronaviruses: an enteric and pantropic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The variable region genes of a murine anti\\\\coronavirus monoclonal antibody (mAb) were joined by assembly polymerase chain reaction and expressed in Escherichia coli in a single chain variable fragment (scFv) configuration.

On the one hand, vaccination programs are limited by availability of doses and on the other hand, the number of people already infected is still too low to have a disease preventing impact and new emerging variants of the virus seem to partially neglect developed antibodies from previous infections. Nevertheless, by February 2021 after one year of observing high numbers of reported COVID-19 cases in most European countries, we might expect that the immunization level should have an impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here we present an approach for estimating the immunization of the Austrian population and discuss potential consequences on herd immunity effects. To estimate immunization we use a calibrated agent-based simulation model that reproduces the actual COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. From the resulting synthetic individual-based data we can extract the number of immunized persons. We then extrapolate the progression of the epidemic by varying the obtained level of immunization in simulations of an hypothetical uncontrolled epidemic wave indicating potential effects on the effective reproduction number. We compared our theoretical findings with results derived from a classic differential equation SIR-model. As of February 2021, [Formula: see text] of the Austrian population has been affected by a SARS-CoV-2 infection which causes a [Formula: see text] reduction of the effective reproduction number and a [Formula: see text] reduction of the prevalence peak compared to a fully susceptible population.

Prevention of Gl?ssers disease in pigs has been plagued with an inability to design broadly protective vaccines, as many bacterin based platforms generate serovar or strain specific immunity. Subunit vaccines are of interest to provide protective immunity to multiple strains of G. parasuis. Selected proteins for subunit vaccination should be widespread, highly conserved, and surface exposed. RESULTS: Two candidate proteins for subunit vaccination (RlpB and VacJ) against G. parasuis were identified using random mutagenesis and an in vitro organ culture system. Pigs were vaccinated with recombinant RlpB and VacJ, outer membrane proteins with important contributions to cellular function and viability. Though high antibody titers to the recombinant proteins and increased interferon- producing cells were found in subunit vaccinated animals, the pigs were not protected from developing systemic disease. CONCLUSIONS: It appears there may be insufficient RlpB and VacJ exposed on the bacterial surface for antibody to bind, preventing high RlpB and VacJ specific antibody titers from protecting animals from G. parasuis.

Here those models are adapted based on the principles of ligand binding to macromolecules to assess the effect on virus infectivity of inhibitor molecules which target specific proteins of the virus. Three types of inhibitor are considered using the thermodynamic equilibrium model for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of the human lung with parameters for the strength and nature of the interaction between the target virus protein and the inhibitor molecule. The first is competitive inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) trimer binding to its human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor by unfractionated heparin (UFH). Using a novel approach presented here, a value of K(a_virus_T) = 3.53  10(17) M(?1) is calculated for SARS-CoV-2 from the IC(50) for inhibition by UFH of SARS-CoV-2 plaque formation in cell culture together with the dissociation constant K(VI) of 0.73  10(?10) M reported for heparin binding to SARS-CoV-2 SGP trimer. Such a high K(a_virus_T) limits the effectiveness of a competitive inhibitors such as UFH. The second is the attachment of a nanoparticle such as a zinc oxide tetrapod (ZnOT) to the virus shell as for herpes simplex virus (HSV). The increase in molecular weight through ZnOT attachment is predicted to decrease K(a_virus_T) by orders of magnitude by making the entropy change (S(a_immob)) on immobilisation of the ZnOT:virus complex on cell binding more negative than for the virus alone. According to the model, ZnOT acts synergistically with UFH at the IC(50) of 33 g/cm(3) which together decrease viral infectivity by 61,000-fold compared to the two-fold and three-fold decreases predicted for UFH alone at the IC(50) and for ZnOT alone respectively. According to the model here, UFH alone at its peak deliverable dose to the lung of 1,000 g/cm(3) only decreases infectivity by 31-fold. Practicable approaches to target and decrease S(a_immob) for respiratory viruses should therefore be considered. The combination of decreasing S(a_immob) together with blocking the interaction of virus surface protein with its host cell receptor may achieve synergistic effects for faecal-oral viruses and HSV. The third is reversible noncompetitive inhibition of the viral main protease (M(pro)) for which the decrease in p(virogenesis) is assumed to be proportional to the decrease in enzyme activity as predicted by enzyme kinetic equations for a given concentration of inhibitor which binds to M(pro) with dissociation constant K(i). Virologists reporting viral inhibition studies are urged to report the concentration of cells in the cell culture experiment as this is a key parameter in estimating K(a_virus_T) here.","output":"Using thermodynamic equilibrium models to predict the effect of antiviral agents on infectivity: Theoretical application to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the COVID-19 pandemic, which affects the whole world, healthcare professionals (HCP) are at high risk of transmission due to their direct contact with patients with COVID-19.

In healthcare simulation, the pandemic tested the innovative and technological capabilities of simulation programs, educators, operations staff, and administration. This study aimed to answer the question: What is the state of distance simulation practice in 2021? METHODS: This was an IRB-approved, 34-item open survey for any profession involved in healthcare simulation disseminated widely and internationally in seven languages from January 14, 2021, to March 3, 2021. Development followed a multistep process of expert design, testing, piloting, translation, and recruitment. The survey asked questions to understand: Who was using distance simulation? What driving factors motivated programs to initiate distance sim? For what purposes was distance sim being used? What specific types or modalities of distance simulation were occurring? How was it being used (i.e., modalities, blending of technology and resources and location)? How did the early part of the pandemic differ from the latter half of 2020 and early 2021? What information would best support future distance simulation education? Data were cleaned, compiled, and analyzed for dichotomized responses, reporting frequencies, proportions, as well as a comparison of response proportions. RESULTS: From 32 countries, 618 respondents were included in the analysis. The findings included insights into the prevalence of distance simulation before, during, and after the pandemic; drivers for using distance simulation; methods and modalities of distance simulation; and staff training. The majority of respondents (70%) reported that their simulation center was conducting distance simulation. Significantly more respondents indicated long-term plans for maintaining a hybrid format (82%), relative to going back to in-person simulation (11%, p < 0.001).

These include individual training, organizational culture change management, and legislative changes. The importance of relationships and stakeholder engagement in EIDM has led to an evolution of models and approaches including integrated knowledge translation (IKT). IKT has emerged as a key strategy for ensuring that engagement is equitable, demand-driven, and responsive. As a result, the African-German Collaboration for Evidence-Based Healthcare and Public Health in Africa (CEBHA+) incorporated an IKT approach to influence noncommunicable diseases (NCD) policy and practice. We documented the phased process of developing, implementing, and monitoring the IKT approach in South Africa; and explored the appropriateness of using the exploration, preparation, implementation, and sustainment (EPIS) framework for this purpose. METHODS: We mapped the South Africa IKT approach onto the EPIS framework using a framework analysis approach. Notes of team meetings, stakeholder matrices, and engagement strategies were analysed and purposefully plotted against the four phases of the framework in order to populate the different constructs. We discussed and finalized the analysis in a series of online iterations until consensus was reached. RESULTS: The mapping exercise revealed an IKT approach that was much more iterative, dynamic, and engaging than initially thought. Several constructs (phase-agnostic) remained important and stable across EPIS phases: stable and supportive funding; committed and competent leadership; skilled and dedicated IKT champions; diverse and established personal networks; a conducive and enabling policy environment; and boundary-spanning intermediaries. Constructs such as innovations constantly evolved and adapted to the changing inner and outer contexts (phase-specific). CONCLUSIONS: Using the EPIS framework to interrogate, reflect on, and document our IKT experiences proved extremely relevant and useful. Phase-agnostic constructs proved critical to ensure resilience and agility of NCD deliberations and policies in the face of highly dynamic and changing local contexts, particularly in view of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Bridging IKT with a framework from implementation science helps to reflect on this process and can guide the development and planning of similar interventions and strategies.","output":"Integrated knowledge translation to advance noncommunicable disease policy and practice in South Africa: application of the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the concept of frailty back to the centre of debate, particularly for its relevance as a determinant of health outcomes Frailty is concept that has long been a used gerontology Today, several theoretical models of frailty are proposed in the literature, with as many tools to operationalize it This article provides a brief outline of the three main models of frailty and the corresponding measurement instruments The choice of the model as well as the choice of the assessment tool are discussed in the light of the clinical objectives pursued by health professionals More generally, this article highlights the value of assessing frailty in routine practice to determine health outcomes and adapt care to individual needs","output":"[Assessing frailty in care practices : quick reminders in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans is still not well understood. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-specific CTL responses, in particular their magnitude and duration of postinfection immunity, have not been extensively studied. In this study, we found that heat-inactivated SARS-CoV elicited recall CTL responses to newly identified spike protein-derived epitopes (SSp-1, S978, and S1202) in peripheral blood of all HLA-A*0201(+) recovered SARS patients over 1 year postinfection. Intriguingly, heat-inactivated SARS-CoV elicited recall-like CTL responses to SSp-1 but not to S978, S1202, or dominant epitopes from several other human viruses in 5 of 36 (13.8%) HLA-A*0201(+) healthy donors without any contact history with SARS-CoV. SSp-1-specific CTLs expanded from memory T cells of both recovered SARS patients, and the five exceptional healthy donors shared a differentiated effector CTL phenotype, CD45RA(+)CCR7(-)CD62L(-), and expressed CCR5 and CD44. However, compared with the high avidity of SSp-1-specific CTLs derived from memory T cells of recovered SARS patients, SSp-1-specific CTLs from the five exceptional healthy donors were of low avidity, as determined by their rapid tetramer dissociation kinetics and reduced cytotoxic reactivity, IFN-gamma secretion, and intracellular production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, perforin, and granzyme A. These results indicate that SARS-CoV infection induces strong and long-lasting CTL-mediated immunity in surviving SARS patients, and that cross-reactive memory T cells to SARS-CoV may exist in the T cell repertoire of a small subset of healthy individuals and can be reactivated by SARS-CoV infection.","output":"Response of memory CD8+ T cells to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in recovered SARS patients and healthy individuals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents a novel application of soft-computing through intelligent, neural networks backpropagated by LevenbergCMarquardt scheme (NNs-BLMS) to solve the mathematical model of unsteady thin film flow of magnetized Maxwell fluid with thermo-diffusion effects and chemical reaction (TFFMFTDECR) over a horizontal rotating disk. The expression for thermophoretic velocity is accounted. Energy expression is deliberated with the addition of non-uniform heat source. The PDEs of mathematical model of TFFMFTDECR are transformed to ODEs by the application of similarity transformations. A dataset is generated through Adams method for the proposed NNs-BLMS in case of various scenarios of TFFMFTDECR model by variation of rotation parameter, magnetic parameter, space dependent heat sink/source parameter, temperature dependent heat sink/source parameter and chemical reaction controlling parameter. The designed computational solver NNs-BLMS is implemented by performing training, testing and validation for the solution of TFFMFTDECR system for different variants. Variation of various physical parameters are designed via plots and explain in details. It is depicted that thin film thickness increases for higher values of disk rotation parameter, while it diminishes for higher magnetic parameter. Furthermore, higher values of Dufour number and the corresponding diminishing values of Soret number causes enhancement in fluid temperature profile. Further the effectiveness of NNs-BLMS is validated by comparing the results of the proposed solver and the standard solution of TFFMFTDECR model through error analyses, histogram representations and regression analyses.","output":"The intelligent networks for double-diffusion and MHD analysis of thin film flow over a stretched surface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For decades after her death, doctors and scientists repeatedly failed to ask her family for consent as they revealed Lacks's name publicly, gave her medical records to the media, and even published her cells' genome online First is action on consent The last time the US Department of Health and Human Services worked to revise the Common Rule, it proposed a series of other changes at the same time;perhaps one way forward is to tackle consent for biospecimens on its own, and with discussion involving both scientists and the public","output":"Henrietta Lacks: science must right a historical wrong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few publications have assessed long-term results of distal locking of short endomedullary nails for extracapsular hip fracture. Virtually all of them focus on immediate differences. Criteria for the use of static or dynamic locking are unclear in most nailing systems, and use is advised in unstable fracture patterns or with risk of bell-clapper effect, but often influenced by the orthopaedic school. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a historical cohort study on patients diagnosed and operated in 2014 and followed up until endpoint, considered as consolidation or major complication, plus evaluation of overall long-term survival. They were categorised as static distal locking (ST) or dynamic distal locking (DN). Both are comparable, except for all stable pre-operative classifications, Fracture Mobility Score (FMS) at discharge, and immediate post-operative loading, all of which were in favour of DN. RESULTS: Consolidation took place in > 95% of patients, with a non-statistically significant delay trend in ST. Less than 6% in both ST and DN had major complications, with no differences. Most cases suffered early cut-out. Significant fracture collapse was the most frequent minor complication. There were more statistically significant minor and total complications in ST. Infection, without differences, can precede cut-out. Lateral thigh pain was similar and could be related to back-out. In DN, 21.1% of cases were truly dynamised. We did not find differences in mobility or in long-term survival. CONCLUSIONS: Any type of distal locking seems to be safe for consolidation, despite a slightly longer consolidation time in static locking. Early cut-out was the main complication, while others were very infrequent, which is an advantage over helical blade devices. There was a higher rate of minor and overall mechanical complications in ST, but infection and lateral thigh pain were similar. Most non-traumatic mechanical complications occurred around 5C6 weeks. About one in five of the DN truly dynamised, with all cases occurring before 8 weeks. Mobility until endpoint and overall long-term survival were not influenced by the locking mode used.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences and attitudes of elementary school students and their parents (two generations from the same family) toward online learning in China during the pandemic. METHODS: A 16-item questionnaire was distributed at the 10-day and 40-day marks after the start of the first online course to 867 parent-child pairs and 141 parent-child pairs, respectively. The questionnaire was comprised of questions pertaining to course and homework completeness, effectiveness, reliability, and abundance as well as the students enthusiasm for taking part in online classes and their satisfaction with the courses. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 90.7% (786/867) of students exhibited high or moderate enthusiasm for participating in online classes. However, most students performed poorly in online learning classes and after-school homework. With regard to satisfaction, parents' and students' average scores were 7.35 and 7.25, respectively (10-point scoring system). During the second stage of this study, parents' positive evaluations for online learning declined, including those for the effectiveness and reliability of the courses. Furthermore, the proportion of students who completed the courses and homework on time decreased; this difference proved statistically significant (P=.047). The parents and students overall satisfaction with online learning also declined during the second stage (parents: 7.21; students: 7.23); however, the difference in overall satisfaction between the two stages was not statistically significant (parents: P=.53; students: P=.60). Several of the parents (315/867, 36.2%) indicated that assisting with and supervising the students online learning resulted in increased stress. Further, 36% of parents expressed dissatisfaction with or provided suggestions for online learning; most parents and students hoped to return to face-to-face classes (parents: 823/867, 94.9%; students: 811/867, 93.5%). Finally, our results presented the following six main issues that parents were the most concerned about: (1) disappointment regarding timely interaction in courses; (2) apprehensiveness about students understanding of the course; (3) the increased burden of annoying adult responsibilities; (4) concern about children's eyesight; (5) the idea that teachers explanations were not detailed enough; and (6) concerns about the decline of students' interest in and attention toward online courses. CONCLUSIONS: Online learning can prevent the spread of infectious diseases while still allowing elementary school students to attain knowledge. However, in our study, childrens completion of the courses and homework were not satisfactory. Furthermore, their parents often experienced stress and had many concerns and complaints. Measures such as increasing the interactivity of the courses and prohibiting teachers from assigning tasks to parents could improve the effectiveness of these courses and the mental health of parents and students.","output":"Experiences and Attitudes of Elementary School Students and Their Parents Toward Online Learning in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunometabolism, which is the metabolic reprogramming of anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolite synthesis upon immune cell activation, has gained importance as a regulator of the homeostasis, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets that function as key factors in immunity. Metabolic changes in epithelial and other stromal cells in response to different stimulatory signals are also crucial in infection, inflammation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. The crosstalk between the PI3KCAKTCmTOR and LKB1CAMPK signaling pathways is critical for modulating both immune and nonimmune cell metabolism. The bidirectional interaction between immune cells and metabolism is a topic of intense study. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokine receptors, and T and B cell receptors have been shown to activate multiple downstream metabolic pathways. However, how intracellular innate immune sensors/receptors intersect with metabolic pathways is less well understood. The goal of this review is to examine the link between immunometabolism and the functions of several intracellular innate immune sensors or receptors, such as nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs, or NOD-like receptors), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs), and the cyclic dinucleotide receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING). We will focus on recent advances and describe the impact of these intracellular innate immune receptors on multiple metabolic pathways.

There have been developments in modern diagnostic systems that can help detect melanoma in its early stages to save the lives of many people. There is also a significant growth in the design of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems using advanced artificial intelligence. The purpose of the present research is to develop a system to diagnose skin cancer, one that will lead to a high level of detection of the skin cancer. The proposed system was developed using deep learning and traditional artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms. The dermoscopy images were collected from the PH2 and ISIC 2018 in order to examine the diagnose system. The developed system is divided into feature-based and deep leaning. The feature-based system was developed based on feature-extracting methods. In order to segment the lesion from dermoscopy images, the active contour method was proposed. These skin lesions were processed using hybrid feature extractions, namely, the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods to extract the texture features. The obtained features were then processed using the artificial neural network (ANNs) algorithm. In the second system, the convolutional neural network (CNNs) algorithm was applied for the efficient classification of skin diseases; the CNNs were pretrained using large AlexNet and ResNet50 transfer learning models. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-art methods for HP2 and ISIC 2018 datasets. Standard evaluation metrics like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, recall, and F-score were employed to evaluate the results of the two proposed systems. The ANN model achieved the highest accuracy for PH2 (97.50%) and ISIC 2018 (98.35%) compared with the CNN model.

RESULTS: The move to remote telephone consultations highlighted the difficulties experienced by participants in accessing health care. These barriers included problems at the practice level associated with remote triage as participants did not always have access to a phone or the means to pay for a phone call. This fostered increased reliance on support workers and clinicians working in the community to provide or facilitate a primary care appointment.

Methods: In this single-center study, we retrospectively included 118 cases of NCP, from January 16, 2020 to February 4, 2020. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 11, 2020. The outcomes of NCP patients were phase summarized at our institution. Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated. The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow-up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. Results: Six patients were improved to no-emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type. Besides, 13 patients progressed from the common type group to the emergency group (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type). Forty-two (35.6%) patients were discharged with a median hospital stay of 9.5 days (range, 4.0-15.0 days). Thus, the numbers in different responses were, 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no-emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no-emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no-emergency cases). No patient has died in our hospital to date. The median duration of progress observed from CT scans was 6 days (range, 2-14 days).

At baseline, eligible participants had to have HbA1c of at least 80% (64 mmol/mol), BMI between 300 and 399 kg/m(2), and type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and be aged 30-67 years. We randomly assigned participants to receive either intensive lifestyle and medical management alone (lifestyle and medical management), or lifestyle and medical management plus standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (gastric bypass). Staff from the clinical centres had access to data from individual patients, but were masked to other patients' data and aggregated data until the 2-year follow-up. Drugs for hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia were prescribed by protocol. The primary endpoint was achievement of the composite treatment goal of HbA1c less than 70% (53 mmol/mol), LDL cholesterol less than 259 mmol/L, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg at 12 months; here we report the composite outcome and other pre-planned secondary outcomes at 24 months.

FINDINGS Between April 21, 2008, and Nov 21, 2011, we randomly assigned 120 eligible patients to either lifestyle and medical management alone (n=60) or with the addition of gastric bypass (n=60). One patient in the lifestyle and medical management group died (from pancreatic cancer), thus 119 were included in the primary analysis. Significantly more participants in the gastric bypass group achieved the composite triple endpoint at 24 months than in the lifestyle and medical management group (26 [43%] vs eight [14%]; odds ratio 51 [95% CI 20-126], p=00004), mainly through improved glycaemic control (HbA1c <70% [53 mmol/mol] in 45 [75%] vs 14 [24%]; treatment difference -19% (-25 to -14); p=00001). 46 clinically important adverse events occurred in the gastric bypass group and 25 in the lifestyle and medical management group (mainly infections in both groups [four in the lifestyle and medical management group, eight in the gastric bypass group]). With a negative binomial model adjusted for site, the event rate for the gastric bypass group was non-significantly higher than the lifestyle and medical management group by a factor of 167 (95% CI 098-287, p=006). Across both years of the study, the gastric bypass group had seven serious falls with five fractures, compared with three serious falls and one fracture in the lifestyle and medical management group. All fractures happened in women. Many more nutritional deficiencies occurred in the gastric bypass group (mainly deficiencies in iron, albumin, calcium, and vitamin D), despite protocol use of nutritional supplements. INTERPRETATION The addition of gastric bypass to lifestyle and medical management in patients with type 2 diabetes improved diabetes control, but adverse events and nutritional deficiencies were more frequent. Larger and longer studies are needed to investigate whether the benefits and risk of gastric bypass for type 2 diabetes can be balanced.

This paper analyses the short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 peak on the socio-economic and environmental aspects of Pakistan. According to the estimates, an economic loss of about 10%, i.e. 1.1 trillion PKR, will be observed in the FY 2021.

At New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, we needed to develop an innovative system of how to safely discharge the massive influx of patients. Inundation of patient care with limited manpower and resources forced us to align with a third-party vendor, around-the-clock alert, to make remote patient monitoring (RPM) possible. Each patient was prescribed a pulse oximeter and nurses were assigned to monitor vital signs, speak to patients, and escalate to physicians if required. Results: We enrolled 50 patients, of whom 13 were escalated resulting in 3 emergency room visits and 1 readmission. We had a high compliance rate with high patient satisfaction in postsurveys. Discussion: Our program was unique in that it utilized telemedicine for regular patient follow-up, along with RPM through a third-party vendor. Patients were able to be safely discharged home with close follow-up through regularly obtained vitals with access to a 24/7 hotline for any emergencies, possibly preventing readmissions. Limitations include a small sample size population. Conclusions: Our experience shows that in a short period despite lack of resources, telehealth and RPM's concurrent use with a third-party vendor could be successfully utilized for safe discharges with high patient satisfaction.","output":"Reengineering the Discharge Transition Process of COVID-19 Patients Using Telemedicine, Remote Patient Monitoring, and Around-the-Clock Remote Patient Monitoring from the Emergency Department and Inpatient Units."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has proven to be a challenge in regard to the clinical presentation, prevention, diagnosis, and management of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection among children who are candidates for and recipients of SOT.

We developed consensus statements to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (17), thoracic radiologists (5), and thoracic surgeons (2) was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A pre-defined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (5), evaluation of intermediate and high risk lung nodules (4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements by voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations where it was felt to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize non-urgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusions There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.","output":"Management of Lung Nodules and Lung Cancer Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic: CHEST Expert Panel Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this collection of essays is to gain insights into the different national-level state responses to COVID-19 around the world and the conditions that shaped them. The pandemic offers a natural experiment wherein the policy problem governments faced was the same but the responses they made were different, creating opportunities for comparison of both the kinds of policy tools being used and the factors that accounted for their choice. Accordingly, after surveying on-line databases of policy tools used in the pandemic and subjecting these to topic modelling to reveal the characteristics of a standard national pandemic response, we discuss the similarities and differences found in specific responses. This is done with reference to the nature and level of policy capacity of respective governments, highlighting the critical roles played by (in)adequate preparation and lesson-drawing from past experiences with similar outbreaks or crises. Taken together the articles show how the national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were shaped by the opportunity and capacity each government had to learn from previous pandemics and their capacity to operationalize and build political support for the standard portfolio of policy measures deployed to deal with the crisis. However, they also show how other factors such as the nature of national leadership, the organization of government and civil society, and blindspots towards the vulnerabilities of certain population segments also helped to shape policy responses to the pandemic.","output":"Mobilizing Policy (In)Capacity to Fight COVID-19: Understanding Variations in State Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In malaria elimination settings, available metrics for malaria surveillance have been insufficient to measure the performance of passive case detection adequately. An indicator for malaria suspected cases with malaria test (MSCT) is proposed to measure the rate of testing on persons presenting to health facilities who satisfy the definition of a suspected malaria case. This metric does not rely on prior knowledge of fever prevalence, seasonality, or external denominators, and can be used to compare detection rates in suspected cases within and between countries, including across settings with different levels of transmission. METHODS: To compute the MSCT, an operational definition for suspected malaria cases was established, including clinical and epidemiological criteria. In general, suspected cases included: (1) persons with fever detected in areas with active malaria transmission; (2) persons with fever identified in areas with no active transmission and travel history to, or residence in areas with active transmission (either national or international); and (3) persons presenting with fever, chills and sweating from any area. Data was collected from 9 countries: Belize, Colombia (in areas with active transmission), Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama (SeptemberCMarch 2020). A sample of eligible medical records for 2018 was selected from a sample of health facilities in each country. An algorithm was constructed to assess if a malaria test was ordered or performed for cases that met the suspected case definition. RESULTS: A sample of 5873 suspected malaria cases was obtained from 239 health facilities. Except for Nicaragua and Colombia, malaria tests were requested in less than 10% of all cases. More cases were tested in areas with active transmission than areas without cases. Travel history was not systematically recorded in any country. CONCLUSIONS: A statistically comparable, replicable, and standardized metric was proposed to measure suspected malaria cases with a test (microscopy or rapid diagnostic test) that enables assessing the performance of passive case detection. Cross-country findings have important implications for malaria and infectious disease surveillance, which should be promptly addressed as countries progress towards malaria elimination. Local and easy-to-implement tools could be implemented to assess and improve passive case detection.","output":"Performance of passive case detection for malaria surveillance: results from nine countries in Mesoamerica and the Dominican Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus related discussions have spiraled at an exponential rate since its initial outbreak.

Patients with incident severe gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis) and gallstone-related procedures (elective and non-elective cholecystectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]) that led to hospital admission were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedure codes. Annual incidence rates of gallstone-related complications and procedures were calculated and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated assuming a Poisson distribution. RESULTS: The hospital admission rate for severe gallstone disease increased with advancing age and the age-standardized rate (95% CI) per 1000 population was 0.60 (0.59C0.60) for men and 0.59 (0.59C0.60) for women. Men had a higher rate of acute cholecystitis, probably due to the substantially lower rate of elective cholecystectomy among men than women. For those aged 20C39, hospital admissions for all gallstone-related complications and procedures increased significantly. For those aged 60, incidences of biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and hospital admission for gallstone receiving ERCP increased significantly without substantial change in the incidence of acute cholecystitis and despite a decreased rate of elective cholecystectomy.

MethodsAt twenty-four randomly selected primary and secondary schools, one class each was examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household and schooling characteristics, leisure time activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and facemask wearing were assessed. ResultsAmong 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was SARS-CoV-2 infected (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%); 16% reported symptoms upon examination, and 48% in the preceding 14 days.

However, once vaccine production starts, it will probably take time before there is enough vaccine for everyone, evoking the question how to distribute it best. While present vaccination guidelines largely focus on individual-based factors, i.e. on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first, e.g. to risk groups or to individuals with a strong social-mixing tendency, here we ask if a strategic spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines, e.g. to prioritize certain cities, can help to increase the overall survival rate of a population subject to an epidemic disease. To this end, we propose a strategy for the distribution of vaccines in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with the most new cases of infection during a certain time frame and compare it with the standard practice of distributing vaccines demographically. Using a simple statistical model we find that, for a locally well-mixed population, the proposed strategy strongly reduces the number of deaths (by about a factor of two for basic reproduction numbers of [Formula: see text] and by about 35% for [Formula: see text] ). The proposed vaccine distribution strategy establishes the idea that prioritizing individuals not only regarding individual factors, such as their risk of spreading the disease, but also according to the region in which they live can help saving lives. The suggested vaccine distribution strategy can be tested in more detailed models in the future and might inspire discussions regarding the importance of spatiotemporal distribution rules for vaccination guidelines.","output":"Strategic spatiotemporal vaccine distribution increases the survival rate in an infectious disease like Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review: Modified risk products (MRP) such as electronic vaping cigarettes (EVC) and heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBC) are alternatives to traditional combustion cigarettes (TCC) with an expanding consumer base. Yet, their cardiovascular health risks are still unclear. We aimed to summarize the evidence base on this topic by conducting an updated umbrella review. Recent Findings: We identified 7 systematic reviews, totaling 183 studies and reports, ranging from in vitro and in animal studies to clinical studies in apparently healthy volunteers and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. Overall, acute EVC use was associated with several toxic effects at molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and system level. In addition, EVC impacted adversely on blood pressure (BP) management, caused tachycardia, and worsened arterial stiffness. Finally, EVC use was associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events, including atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction, even if the causal link is still debated. Most reviews highlighted that the detrimental impact of EVC was of lesser magnitude of that of TCC. In addition, the differential impact of liquids and nicotine was not clearly disentangled. Finally, no review included studies on HNBC. Summary: The present umbrella review suggests that EVC, and likely HNBC, despite clearly causing an increase in overall cardiovascular risk, may represent a temporary lesser evil than TCC in a risk-reduction or risk-modification strategy, aiming for eventual abstinence from all tobacco or nicotine products.","output":"Vaping Cardiovascular Health Risks: an Updated Umbrella Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overactivation of neuroimmune signaling has been linked to excessive ethanol consumption. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major component of innate immune signaling and initiate anti- and pro-inflammatory responses via intracellular signal transduction cascades. TLR7 is upregulated in post-mortem brain tissue from humans with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and animals with prior exposure to ethanol. Despite this evidence, the role of TLR7 in the regulation of voluntary ethanol consumption has not been studied. We test the hypothesis that TLR7 activation regulates voluntary ethanol drinking behavior by administering a TLR7 agonist (R848) during an intermittent access drinking procedure in mice. Acute activation of TLR7 reduced ethanol intake, preference, and total fluid intake due, at least in part, to an acute sickness response. However, chronic pre-treatment with R848 resulted in tolerance to the adverse effects of the drug and a subsequent increase in ethanol consumption. To determine the molecular machinery that mediates these behavioral changes, we evaluated gene expression after acute and chronic TLR7 activation. We found that acute TLR7 activation produces brain region specific changes in expression of immune pathway genes, whereas chronic TLR7 activation causes downregulation of TLRs and blunted cytokine induction, suggesting molecular tolerance. Our results demonstrate a novel role for TLR7 signaling in regulating voluntary ethanol consumption. Taken together, our findings suggest TLR7 may be a viable target for development of therapies to treat AUD.","output":"Role of TLR7 in voluntary alcohol consumption."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To determine the relationship between distant learning and neck pain during COVID-19 pandemic especially among medical students, thus we aim to assess prevalence of neck pain for specific Group and time.

BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 throughout the world determined a series of modifications of several National Health Service organisations, with a potential series of psychological consequences among nurses, who were particularly afflicted by this situation of changes and precariousness. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was carried out from February-April 2020. METHODS: A total of 1,005 nurses employed in different Italian hospital wards, during the COVID-19 pandemic, were recruited. Analyses were based on descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep disturbances, moderate anxiety and low self-efficacy was 71.4%, 33.23% and 50.65%, respectively. We found a positive correlation between anxiety and sleep quality (0.408; p < .0001) and negative correlations between self-efficacy and anxiety (-0.217; p < .0001) and sleep quality and self-efficacy (-0.134; p < .0001). The factor independently associated with all variables was gender. Females were more prone to sleep disturbances, anxiety and low levels of self-efficacy than males (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety, sleep disorders and low self-efficacy among Italian nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic was high. Healthcare managers should recognise and consider these results to reduce the risk of the onset of major mental problems that could result in post-traumatic stress disorder. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses facing major incidents as COVID-19 pandemic are among healthcare personnel exposed to a high risk to develop psychological disturbance that should be assessed and recognised, in order to find helpful coping strategies to inform support services and avoid to hesitate in post-traumatic stress disorders.","output":"Anxiety, sleep disorders and self-efficacy among nurses during COVID-19 pandemic: A large cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the major clinical features of COVID-19 is a hyperinflammatory state, which is characterized by high expression of cytokines (such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-), chemokines and growth factors and is associated with severe forms of COVID-19.

In this review, we summarize preclinical and clinical data on ILCs and NK cells concerning their phenotype, function and clinical applications in cellular therapy trials. We also describe how single-cell transcriptome sequencing has been used and forecast how it will be used to better understand ILC and NK involvement in cancer control and progression as well as their therapeutic potential. ABSTRACT: The role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), including natural killer (NK) cells, is pivotal in inflammatory modulation and cancer. Natural killer cell activity and count have been demonstrated to be regulated by the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors together with and as a consequence of different stimuli. The great majority of NK cell populations have an anti-tumor activity due to their cytotoxicity, and for this reason have been used for cellular therapies in cancer patients. On the other hand, the recently classified helper ILCs are fundamentally involved in inflammation and they can be either helpful or harmful in cancer development and progression. Tissue niche seems to play an important role in modulating ILC function and conversion, as observed at the transcriptional level. In the past, these cell populations have been classified by the presence of specific cellular receptor markers; more recently, due to the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it has been possible to also explore them at the transcriptomic level. In this article we review studies on ILC (and NK cell) classification, function and their involvement in cancer. We also summarize the potential application of NK cells in cancer therapy and give an overview of the most recent studies involving ILCs and NKs at scRNA-seq, focusing on cancer. Finally, we provide a resource for those who wish to start single-cell transcriptomic analysis on the context of these innate lymphoid cell populations.","output":"The Dual Role of Innate Lymphoid and Natural Killer Cells in Cancer. from Phenotype to Single-Cell Transcriptomics, Functions and Clinical Uses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is thought to result from a high viral transmission rate. Here, we consider mechanisms that influence host cellCvirus binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SPG) and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with a series of peptides designed to mimic key ACE2 hot spots through adopting a helical conformation analogous to the N-terminal 1 helix of ACE2, the region experimentally shown to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). The approach examines putative structure/function relations by assessing SPG binding affinity with surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A cyclic peptide (c[KFNHEAEDLFEKLM]) was characterized in an -helical conformation with micromolar affinity (KD = 500 M) to the SPG. Thus, stabilizing the helical structure of the 14-mer through cyclization improves binding to SPG by an order of magnitude. In addition, end-group peptide analog modifications and residue substitutions mediate SPG binding, with net charge playing an apparent role. Therefore, we surveyed reported viral variants, and a correlation of increased positive charge with increased virulence lends support to the hypothesis that charge is relevant to enhanced viral fusion. Overall, the structure/function relationship informs the importance of conformation and charge for virus-binding analog design.","output":"Structure/Function Analysis of Truncated Amino-Terminal ACE2 Peptide Analogs That Bind to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has rapidly spread worldwide and resulted in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The disease raised an unprecedented demand for intensive care support due to severe pulmonary dysfunction and multiorgan failure.

We aimed to investigate how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from causes other than COVID-19. METHODS: Working on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged 18 years) in the database on 1(st) February 2020 and with >1 year of continuous prior registration; the cut-off date for deaths was 9(th) November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths, classified according to the presence of a COVID-19 code as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate, were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes. FINDINGS: 17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for 80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities. Smoking, history of cancer and chronic liver disease had stronger associations with non-COVID than COVID-19 death. All non-white ethnic groups had higher odds than white of COVID-19 death (OR for Black: 2.20 [1.96-2.47], South Asian: 2.33 [2.16-2.52]), but lower odds than white of non-COVID death (Black: 0.88 [0.83-0.94], South Asian: 0.78 [0.75-0.81]). INTERPRETATION: Similar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients, with some notable exceptions.

Despite recent research that suggests COVID-19 and lockdown measures may eventually impact sexual response and sexually related behaviors, we are missing clinical sexologists' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 in sexual health. Such perspectives could inform a preliminary framework aimed at guiding future research and clinical approaches in the context of COVID-19. AIM: To explore the perspectives of clinical sexologists about the impact of COVID-19 on their patients' sexual health, as well as the professional challenges they have faced during the current pandemic. Findings are expected to inform a preliminary framework aimed at understanding the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. METHODS: We conducted an online qualitative exploratory survey with 4 open-ended questions with 39 clinical sexologists aged between 32 and 73 years old. The survey was advertised among professional associations' newsletters. We performed a Thematic Analysis using an inductive, semantic, and (critical) realist approach, leading to a final thematic map. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome is the thematic map and the corresponding table that aggregates the main themes, subthemes, and codes derived from participants' answers and that can serve as a preliminary framework to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. RESULTS: The final thematic map, expected to serve as a preliminary framework on the impact of COVID-19 in sexual health, revealed 3 main themes: Clinical Focus, Remapping Relationships, and Reframing Technology Use. These themes aggregate important interrelated issues, such as worsening of sexual problems and dysfunctions, mental health, relationship management, the rise of conservatism, and the use of new technology that influences sexuality and sexual health-related services. CONCLUSION: The current study allowed us to develop a preliminary framework to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. This framework highlights the role of mental health, as well as the contextual nature of sexual problems, and subsequently, their relational nature. Also, it demonstrates that the current pandemic has brought into light the debate of e-Health delivery within clinical sexology. PM Pascoal, J Carvalho, CF Raposo, et al.

Current demographic data on the aging population were gathered to determine clinical applicability of research evidence. Principles of bioethics were considered within a risk/benefit assessment related to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Social determinants of health were examined within the context of the pandemic. Results: Research supports the link between social isolation, loneliness, and negative outcomes in older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of these negative effects, including anxiety/depression, neuroinflammation, substance abuse, physical or nutritional deficits, and a decline in overall health.

Findings were recorded using a portable digital fundus camera. Retinographies were analysed by two retina specialists. Medical records were reviewed for assessment of patient demographics, baseline comorbidities and clinical data. RESULTS: There were a total of 18 patients, nine (50%) male, median IQR age of 62.5 (12) years. Ten of the 18 patients (55.6%; 95% CI 33.7 to 75.4) had abnormalities on dilated eye examination.

Besides, negative connections were found between intrusive thoughts and trauma-related amnesia and between intrusive thoughts and self-destructive/reckless behaviours. Among individuals reporting PTSD, symptoms such as flashbacks and self-destructive/reckless behaviours were on average most strongly connected to other PTSD symptoms in the network. The five strongest positive connections were found between 1) concentration difficulty and sleep disturbance, 2) intrusive thoughts and emotional cue reactivity, 3) negative beliefs and negative trauma-related emotions, 4) irritability/anger and self-destructive/reckless behaviour, and 5) detachment and restricted affect. In addition, a negative connection was found between intrusive thoughts and self-destructive/reckless behaviours. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate similarly positive connections between concentration difficulty and sleep disturbance, negative beliefs and negative trauma-related emotions, and irritability/anger and self-destructive/reckless behaviours in the general and PTSD-reported populations. We argue that self-destructive/reckless behaviours are a core symptom of COVID-19 related PTSD, worthy of more attention in future psychiatric programmers.","output":"Network analysis of COVID-19-related PTSD symptoms in China: the similarities and differences between the general population and PTSD sub-population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is characterized by fever, cough, and affection of the lower respiratory tract. It is associated with age, comorbidities and a weakened immune system. Typically, lymphopenias have been evidenced in severe cases and an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), which would explain the role of the hyperinflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Secondary inflammatory responses from virus reinfections may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a viremic phenomenon that may be an alternative mechanism of cellular infection and should be considered when designing vaccines or immunotherapies involving the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies or the use of monoclonal antibodies. Currently, no vaccines or treatments demonstrate safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19. However, the results from phase III clinical trials which involve the application of an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) nucleic acid vaccine and an antiviral drug (remdisivir), are yet to be concluded. For the time being, the best measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is by implementing social isolation, this measure has been adopted by several countries as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).","output":"COVID-19: respuesta inmune y perspectivas teraputicas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We screened 217 bats of at least 20 species from 17 locations in Kenya during July and August of 2006 for the presence of adenovirus, rhabdovirus, and paramyxovirus nucleic acids using generic reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR assays.

We use humanized in-vitro systems, mouse models, and biospecimens from patients to elucidate the expression dynamics of miR-146a needed to decrease lung injury during mechanical ventilation. We find that the endogenous increase in miR-146a following injurious ventilation is not sufficient to prevent lung injury. However, when miR-146a is highly overexpressed using a nanoparticle delivery platform it is sufficient to prevent injury. These data indicate that the endogenous increase in microRNA-146a during mechanical ventilation is a compensatory response that partially limits injury and that nanoparticle delivery of miR-146a is an effective strategy for mitigating lung injury during mechanical ventilation.","output":"Nanoparticle delivery of microRNA-146a regulates mechanotransduction in lung macrophages and mitigates injury during mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has clearly established how vital rapid, widely accessible diagnostic tests are in controlling infectious diseases and how difficult and slow it is to scale existing technologies.

The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key host membrane-bound protein that modulates ALI induced by viral infection, pulmonary acid aspiration, and sepsis. However, the contributions of ACE2 sequence variants to individual differences in disease risk and severity after viral infection are not understood. In this study, we quantified H1N1 influenza-infected lung transcriptomes across a family of 41 BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice and both parentsC57BL/6J and DBA/2J. In response to infection Ace2 mRNA levels decreased significantly for both parental strains and the expression levels was associated with disease severity (body weight loss) and viral load (expression levels of viral NA segment) across the BXD family members. Pulmonary RNA-seq for 43 lines was analyzed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Bayesian network approaches. Ace2 not only participated in virus-induced ALI by interacting with TNF, MAPK, and NOTCH signaling pathways, but was also linked with high confidence to gene products that have important functions in the pulmonary epithelium, including Rnf128, Muc5b, and Tmprss2. Comparable sets of transcripts were also highlighted in parallel studies of human SARS-CoV-infected primary human airway epithelial cells. Using conventional mapping methods, we determined that weight loss at two and three days after viral infection maps to chromosome Xthe location of Ace2. This finding motivated the hierarchical Bayesian network analysis, which defined molecular endophenotypes of lung infection linked to Ace2 expression and to a key disease outcome. Core members of this Bayesian network include Ace2, Atf4, Csf2, Cxcl2, Lif, Maml3, Muc5b, Reg3g, Ripk3, and Traf3. Collectively, these findings define a causally-rooted Ace2 modulatory network relevant to host response to viral infection and identify potential therapeutic targets for virus-induced respiratory diseases, including those caused by influenza and coronaviruses.","output":"Genetic Dissection of the Regulatory Mechanisms of Ace2 in the Infected Mouse Lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mosquitoes and mosquito-borne disease are a normal part of the Australian summer but the 2019-2020 summer was anything but normal. Above average temperatures and below average rainfall resulted in drought across many parts of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, which then contributed to catastrophic bushfires. However, by late summer, above average rainfall resulted in a dramatic increase in mosquito abundance. While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unfolded, NSW experienced increased activity of mosquito-borne Ross River virus. All these extreme events created many challenges for managing the pest and the public health risks associated with mosquitoes, from maintenance of mosquito monitoring and control programs through to unique challenges of communicating mosquito bite prevention advice to local communities. There are important lessons to be learned in situations where extreme weather events may influence the risk of mosquito-borne disease through driving changes in the abundance and diversity of mosquito populations, while also influencing the abundance and distribution of native wildlife that represents important local reservoirs of arboviruses. Similarly, supporting the maintenance of mosquito monitoring and management programs while local authorities face competing priorities due to extreme natural disasters and/or public health events is critical.","output":"Reflections on a highly unusual summer: bushfires, COVID-19 and mosquito-borne disease in NSW, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Self-isolation seems to be the best way to slow down the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, but it may also have negative impact on physical and mental health.

Individuals engaged in regular physical activity (regardless of duration) had significantly higher happiness ratings (p=0.002). No statistically significant difference was found between the duration of physical activity and the musculoskeletal pain during the pandemic. Conclusion: Pandemic caused a decrease in physical activity, an unhappy and anxious mood, and an increase in musculoskeletal pain of healthcare workers.

We were able to quantify the amount of the three main influenza proteins (hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and ion channel matrix protein 2 (M2)) per cell and per VLP with nanometer resolution and single-molecule sensitivity, proving that DNA-PAINT is a powerful technique to characterize recombinant viral constructs.","output":"Nanoscale Mapping of Recombinant Viral Proteins: From Cells to Virus-Like Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Concerns regarding potential neurological complications of COVID-19 are being increasingly reported, primarily in small series. Larger studies have been limited by both geography and specialty. Comprehensive characterisation of clinical syndromes is crucial to allow rational selection and evaluation of potential therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the breadth of complications of COVID-19 across the UK that affected the brain. METHODS: During the exponential phase of the pandemic, we developed an online network of secure rapid-response case report notification portals across the spectrum of major UK neuroscience bodies, comprising the Association of British Neurologists (ABN), the British Association of Stroke Physicians (BASP), and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), and representing neurology, stroke, psychiatry, and intensive care. Broad clinical syndromes associated with COVID-19 were classified as a cerebrovascular event (defined as an acute ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or thrombotic vascular event involving the brain parenchyma or subarachnoid space), altered mental status (defined as an acute alteration in personality, behaviour, cognition, or consciousness), peripheral neurology (defined as involving nerve roots, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscle), or other (with free text boxes for those not meeting these syndromic presentations). Physicians were encouraged to report cases prospectively and we permitted recent cases to be notified retrospectively when assigned a confirmed date of admission or initial clinical assessment, allowing identification of cases that occurred before notification portals were available. Data collected were compared with the geographical, demographic, and temporal presentation of overall cases of COVID-19 as reported by UK Government public health bodies. FINDINGS: The ABN portal was launched on April 2, 2020, the BASP portal on April 3, 2020, and the RCPsych portal on April 21, 2020. Data lock for this report was on April 26, 2020. During this period, the platforms received notification of 153 unique cases that met the clinical case definitions by clinicians in the UK, with an exponential growth in reported cases that was similar to overall COVID-19 data from UK Government public health bodies. Median patient age was 71 years (range 23-94; IQR 58-79). Complete clinical datasets were available for 125 (82%) of 153 patients. 77 (62%) of 125 patients presented with a cerebrovascular event, of whom 57 (74%) had an ischaemic stroke, nine (12%) an intracerebral haemorrhage, and one (1%) CNS vasculitis. 39 (31%) of 125 patients presented with altered mental status, comprising nine (23%) patients with unspecified encephalopathy and seven (18%) patients with encephalitis. The remaining 23 (59%) patients with altered mental status fulfilled the clinical case definitions for psychiatric diagnoses as classified by the notifying psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrist, and 21 (92%) of these were new diagnoses. Ten (43%) of 23 patients with neuropsychiatric disorders had new-onset psychosis, six (26%) had a neurocognitive (dementia-like) syndrome, and four (17%) had an affective disorder. 18 (49%) of 37 patients with altered mental status were younger than 60 years and 19 (51%) were older than 60 years, whereas 13 (18%) of 74 patients with cerebrovascular events were younger than 60 years versus 61 (82%) patients older than 60 years. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide, cross-specialty surveillance study of acute neurological and psychiatric complications of COVID-19. Altered mental status was the second most common presentation, comprising encephalopathy or encephalitis and primary psychiatric diagnoses, often occurring in younger patients. This study provides valuable and timely data that are urgently needed by clinicians, researchers, and funders to inform immediate steps in COVID-19 neuroscience research and health policy.

OBJECTIVE To determine pathological correlates and clinical factors identifiable during life that predict the presence of severe CAA in persons with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We compared demographic and clinical variables at the earliest visit during life at which participants were found to have cognitive impairment and compared pathological variables between persons ultimately found to have no or severe CAA at autopsy using logistic regression. Analyses were repeated separately for carriers and noncarriers of the APOE 4 allele. Data were obtained from the Uniform Data Set, which comprises longitudinal clinical assessments performed in the Alzheimer's Disease Centers funded by the National Institute on Aging. Participants included 193 persons with AD and severe CAA and 232 persons with AD and no CAA. All participants had cognitive impairment and met National Institute on Aging-Reagan Institute neuropathological criteria for AD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of demographic characteristics and the APOE 4 allele and odds ratios (ORs) of clinical variables for the prediction of severe CAA. RESULTS Persons with severe CAA compared with those without CAA were more likely to carry an APOE 4 allele (64.9% vs 42.8%, respectively; P < .001), to be Hispanic (6.8% vs 1.3%, respectively; P = .003), to have had a transient ischemic attack (12.5% vs 6.1%, respectively; OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.4), and to have lower degrees of diffuse amyloid plaque pathology (mean [SD] Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score, 1.2 [0.5] vs 1.4 [0.8], respectively; P = .01). Those with CAA compared with those without CAA more commonly had intracerebral hemorrhage (9.3% vs 3.5%, respectively; P = .01), cortical microinfarcts (20.7% vs 12.9%, respectively; P = .03), and subcortical leukoencephalopathy (20.5% vs 12.1%, respectively; P = .02).

As of April 3, 2020, there were 1,009,625 reported confirmed cases, and 51,737 reported deaths. Doctors have been faced with a myriad of patients who present with many different symptoms. This raises two important questions. What are the common symptoms, and what are their relative importance? METHODS: A non-structured and incomplete COVID-19 dataset of 14,251 confirmed cases was preprocessed. This produced a complete and organized COVID-19 dataset of 738 confirmed cases. Six different feature selection algorithms were then applied to this new dataset. Five of these algorithms have been proposed earlier in the literature. The sixth is a novel algorithm being proposed by the authors, called Variance Based Feature Weighting (VBFW), which not only ranks the symptoms (based on their importance) but also assigns a quantitative importance measure to each symptom. RESULTS: For our COVID-19 dataset, the five different feature selection algorithms provided different rankings for the most important top-five symptoms. They even selected different symptoms for inclusion within the top five. This is because each of the five algorithms ranks the symptoms based on different data characteristics. Each of these algorithms has advantages and disadvantages. However, when all these five rankings were aggregated (using two different aggregating methods) they produced two identical rankings of the five most important COVID-19 symptoms. Starting from the most important to least important, they were: Fever/Cough, Fatigue, Sore Throat, and Shortness of Breath. (Fever and cough were ranked equally in both aggregations.) Meanwhile, the sixth novel Variance Based Feature Weighting algorithm, chose the same top five symptoms, but ranked fever much higher than cough, based on its quantitative importance measures for each of those symptoms (Fever - 75 %, Cough - 39.8 %, Fatigue - 16.5 %, Sore Throat - 10.8 %, and Shortness of Breath - 6.6 %). Moreover, the proposed VBFW method achieved an accuracy of 92.1 % when used to build a one-class SVM model, and an NDCG@5 of 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the dataset, and the feature selection algorithms employed here, symptoms of Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Sore Throat and Shortness of Breath are important symptoms of COVID-19. The VBFW algorithm also indicates that Fever and Cough symptoms were especially indicative of COVID-19, for the confirmed cases that are documented in our database.","output":"A novel computational method for assigning weights of importance to symptoms of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The behavioral immune system includes a set of proactive mechanisms that inhibit contact with pathogens in the first place.

The aim of this study was to assess the functionality of the behavioral immune system under conditions of strong ecological validity. Our hypothesis was that the emotional and more primitive component of the behavioral immune system (i.e. pathogen disgust sensitivity) acts as a powerful predictor of fear of infection. The sample was made up of 101 healthcare professionals working in a COVID-19 hospital when vaccination was not yet available. We conducted a hierarchical regression analysis to assess the role of germ-related disgust in modulating levels of fear. After controlling for the significant effects of depressive symptoms and exposure to people with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, we found that fear of infection was more intense in those healthcare workers who reported higher levels of germ-related disgust. Fear of infection was not related to perceived infectability, an individual variable informed by more rational cognitive appraisals. These findings show that, even in healthcare workers who can take advantage of their professional knowledge and acquired skills for rational appraisals, the most primitive component of the behavioral immune system still plays a major role in eliciting fear of COVID-19.

METHODS: We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Childrens Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN- (2/8).

Mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiome plays a role in host immune response to infections and, in turn, may have an impact on the disease trajectory of SARS-CoV2 infection. However, it remains to be established whether modulation of the microbiome can impact COVID-19-related symptomatology and patient outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a study designed to modulate the microbiome evaluating the safety and physiologic effects of KB109 combined with self-supportive care (SSC) vs SSC alone in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. KB109 is a novel synthetic glycan developed to increase the production of gut microbial metabolites that support immune system homeostasis through gut microbiome modulation. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of the safety of KB109, the natural course of COVID-19 symptomatology, and the possible role of the gut microbiome in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Methods Adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were randomized 1:1 to receive KB109 combined with SSC or SSC alone for 14 days and were then followed for an additional 21 days (35 days in total). Patients self-assessed their COVID-19-related symptoms (8 cardinal symptoms plus 5 additional symptoms) and self-reported comorbidities. The primary and secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of KB109 plus SSC compared with that of SSC alone and to evaluate selected measures of health, respectively. Results Between July 2, 2020 and December 23, 2020, 350 patients were randomized to receive KB109 and SSC (n=174) or SSC alone (n=176). Overall, the most common comorbidities reported were hypertension (18.0% [63/350 patients]) followed by chronic lung disease (8.6% 30/350 patients). KB109 was well tolerated with most treatment-emergent adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. The administration of KB109 plus SSC reduced medically-attended visits (ie, hospitalization, emergency room visits, or urgent care visits) by 50.0% in the overall population and by 61.7% in patients with []1 comorbidity; in patients aged []45 years or with []1 comorbidity, medically-attended visits were reduced by 52.8%, In the SSC group, patients reporting []1 comorbidity had a longer median time to resolution of symptoms than those who reported no comorbidities at baseline (13 overall symptoms: 30 vs 21 days, respectively; hazard ratio [HR]=1.163 [95% CI, 0.723-1.872]; 8 cardinal symptoms: 21 vs 15 days, respectively; HR=1.283 [95% CI, 0.809-2.035]). In patients reporting []1 comorbidity, median time to resolution of symptoms was shorter in the KB109 plus SSC group compared with the SSC alone group (13 overall symptoms: 30 vs 21 days, respectively; HR=1.422 [95% CI, 0.898-2.250]; 8 cardinal symptoms: 17 vs 21 days, respectively; HR=1.574 [95% CI, 0.997-2.485]).

Several lines of evidence suggest that surveillance of sewage and waste can provide an early warning sign for COVID-19 recurrence in a community. In support, SARS-CoV-2 traces were found in sewage in several countries. With this in mind, it is notable that pests, such as cockroaches, are exposed to pathogenic microbes routinely, yet thrive in polluted environments. Such species have likely developed mechanisms to protect themselves against pathogens. In support, recent studies showed that cockroaches possess potent antibacterial molecules to shield themselves from pathogenic bacteria. Among hundreds of molecules, some contained thiazine groups, imidazoles, chromene derivatives, isoquinoline group, sulfonamides, pyrrole-containing analogs, flavanones, and furanones. Here, we propose that cockroaches are a potential source of antiviral molecules to thwart infections. Because this is an unexploited resource for potential antivirals, we believe that cockroaches offer a unique source for novel bioactive molecule(s) to counter COVID-19 with huge clinical impact worldwide.","output":"Targeting SARS-CoV-2: Novel Source of Antiviral Compound(s) against COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preventing the biological activity of SARS-CoV-2 main protease using natural compounds is of great interest.

Objective: The main objective is to prevent adverse selection problems in the operations of a diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) system with the game pricing model for scientific and reasonable pricing. Methods: The study proposes an improved bargaining game model over three stages, with the government and patients forming an alliance. The first stage assumes the alliance is the price maker in the Stackelberg game to maximize social welfare. Medical institutions are a price taker and decide the level of quality of medical service to maximize their revenue. A Stackelberg equilibrium solution is obtained. The second stage assumes medical institutions dominate the Stackelberg game and set an optimal service quality for maximizing their revenues. The alliance as the price taker decides the price to maximize the social welfare. Another Stackelberg equilibrium solution is achieved. The final stage establishes a Rubinstein bargaining game model to combine the Stackelberg equilibrium solutions in the first and second stage. A new equilibrium between the alliance and medical institutions is established. Results: The results show that if the price elasticity of demand increases, the ratio of cost compensation on medical institutions will increase, and the equilibrium price will increase. The equilibrium price is associated with the coefficient of patients' quality preference. The absolute risk aversion coefficient of patients affects government compensation and total social welfare. Conclusion: In a DRGs system, considering the demand elasticity and the quality preference of patients, medical service pricing can prevent an adverse selection problem. In the future, we plan to generalize these models to DRGs pricing systems with the effects of competition of medical institutions. In addition, we suggest considering the differential compensation for general hospitals and community hospitals in a DRGs system, in order to promote the goal of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment.","output":"A Game Model for Medical Service Pricing Based on the Diagnosis Related Groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between interruption to routine medical care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and sickness presenteeism among workers in Japan.

From a consumer perspective, identifying healthy, sustainable and affordable choices based on individual food products rather than diets could promote better shopping choices. Objective: To identify foods and drinks with the highest nutritional quality and lowest greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and price. We also assessed how a combination of these indicators (e.g., nutritional quality, GHGE and price) for food categories aligned with current United Kingdom dietary recommendations. Materials and Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) nutrient databank year 11 (2018/2019). Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the strength of relationships between nutritional quality, environmental impact and/or prices per 100 kcal. In addition, we developed an optimized nutritional quality, GHGE and price score for each food or drink item based on the overall medians for each of these indicators. Results: Median nutritional value was highest for fruit and vegetables, whilst median GHGE and price was lower for starchy carbohydrates, fats and items of which consumption should be limited. The relative proportions of foods considered the most nutritious and with a low GHGE and price in each of the food categories, on a per 100 kcal basis, were comparable to the proportions in the Eatwell Guide, except for the proportion of fruits and vegetables being smaller and the proportion of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta, and other starchy carbohydrates being larger in our analysis.

We assessed the post-licensure safety data for IIV3-HD in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 2011-2019. METHODS We searched VAERS for reports after IIV3-HD during 1/1/2011-06/30/2019 in persons aged 65 years. Medical records were reviewed for all death reports and for certain pre-specified conditions (e.g. Guillain Barr Syndrome [GBS], anaphylaxis). We also reviewed certain groups who received IIV3-HD erroneously (e.g. pregnant women, children). Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional reporting. RESULTS VAERS received 12,320 reports after IIV3-HD;723 reports (5.9%) were serious. The most common adverse events (AEs) among serious reports were pyrexia (30.2%), asthenia (28.9%), and dyspnea (24.9%), and among non-serious reports were injection site erythema (16.8%), pain in extremity (15.8%), and injection site pain (14.2%). Among 55 death reports, the most common causes of death were diseases of the circulatory system (n = 23;41.8%). Based on medical record review, there were 61 reports of GBS and 13 of anaphylaxis. There were 13 reports of pregnant-women who inadvertently received IIV3-HD; three reports described arm pain or local reactions, and 10 did not report any AE.

This is why breeders, to improve the functions of the digestive tract, often use special feed additives, i.e., probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics. The need to become independent from soybean meal (SBM), which is currently the basic source of protein in animal nutrition, and the need to stimulate the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), has increased interest in fermented components that have a positive effect on the intestinal microbiota and are a source of valuable protein. In this study, the impact of the diversified proportion of fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) in the diet of rabbits on the immune parameters and the microbiota of the digestive tract was assessed. The reducing effect of the tested feed component against coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli within the small intestine and colon of animals and the anaerobic biota of Clostridium perfringens in the duodenum and cecum of animals was observed while in the duodenuman increase in the beneficial biota of lactic acid bacteria. The conducted analysis also showed many complex correlations between the number of intestinal microbiota groups and the level of immunoglobulins. The results of the conducted research indicate that FRSM, in addition to valuable nutritional values, may play an important probiotic role in the GIT of rabbits. Research of this type is especially important in terms of reducing the use of antibiotics for therapeutic purposes through nutritional prevention of animals. ABSTRACT: The present study was conducted to determine the effect of the use of varying amounts of fermented rapeseed meal in diets for rabbits on the immune status and microbiota of segments of the GIT. Forty 35 day old rabbits used in the experiment were assigned to four groups: the control group (group C) were fed a standard diet and the experimental received 4%, 8% or 12% fermented rapeseed meal (included in place of standard soybean meal). Class A, G and M immunoglobulins were determined in the blood plasma. In the food content collected after slaughter, microbiological parameters were determined for individual sections of the digestive tract. Rabbits from the groups receiving a diet with an increased proportion of fermented rapeseed meal (8% or 12%) had lower concentrations of anaerobic bacteria and Escherichia coli in the intestinal contents. Research has shown that the increase in intake of fermented rapeseed meal was correlated with an increase in the correlations between the immunoglobulin level and the size of the microbial population in the GIT. In light of the presented results fermented rapeseed meal, by supplying valuable bioactive substances, appears to be a good component in the diet of rabbits, enhancing immune system development and helping to prevent disturbances of the gut microbiota.","output":"Effect of Fermented Rapeseed Meal on the Gastrointestinal Microbiota and Immune Status of Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Privacy issues limit the analysis and cross-exploration of most distributed and private biobanks, often raised by the multiple dimensionality and sensitivity of the data associated with access restrictions and policies.

In the present work we show the application of a modified version of the adapted COVID-19 stress scales (ACSS) which also included teaching anxiety and preparedness, and resilience for academic professionals in Mexico. These scales were applied during the unprecedented transformation of the education system undergone in the COVID-19 quarantine. Most of the studied variables: gender, age, academic degree, household occupants, having a disease, teaching level, teaching mode, work hours, resilience, teaching anxiety and preparedness, and fear of being an asymptomatic patient (FOBAP), showed significant statistical correlation between each other (p < 0.050) and to the 6 areas of the ACSS (danger, contamination, social economical, xenophobia, traumatic stress, and compulsive checking). Our results further showed that the perceived stress and anxiety fell into the category of Absent to Mild, with only the danger section of the ACSS falling into the Moderate category. Finally, the resilience generated throughout the quarantine was very high, which seems to be a predictor of adaptation the academic professional has undergone to cope with stress.","output":"Teaching Anxiety, Stress and Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evaluating the Vulnerability of Academic Professionals in Mexico Through the Adapted COVID-19 Stress Scales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contaminant levels are lower in Antarctica than elsewhere in the world because of its low anthropogenic activities. However, the northern region of the Antarctic Peninsula, is close to South America and experiences the greatest anthropogenic pressure in Antarctica. Here, we investigated, in two Antarctic Peninsula islands, intra and interspecific factors that influence the concentrations of 17 trace elements (TEs) in blood and feathers of three penguin species breeding sympatrically in relation to their trophic ecology assessed via a stable isotopic approach (C, N and S). Geographical location, foraging zone (?13C and ?34S) and diet influences the interspecific difference, and sex and maturity stage diet influence the intraspecific difference of Pygoscelis penguins. Penguins from Livingston showed higher values (mean, ng. g-1, dry weight - dw) of Zn (103), Mn (0.3), and Fe (95) than those from King George Island (Zn: 80, Mn: 1.9, and Fe: 11). Gender-related differences were observed, as males showed significantly higher values (mean, ng. g-1, dw) of Rb (3.4) and ?15N in blood of gentoo, and Ca (1344) in Adlie feathers. Chicks of gentoo and Adlie presented higher Zn, Mg, Ca, and Sr and lower 13C values in blood than adults. The highest concentrations (mean, ng. g-1, dw) of Cd (0.2) and Cu (26), and the lowest ?15N values were found in chinstrap. Geographical, intraspecific (i.e., ontogenetic and gender-related) and interspecific differences in feeding seemed to have influenced TE and stable isotope values in these animals. The TE bioaccumulation by penguins may have also been influenced by natural enrichment in environmental levels of these elements, which seems to be the case for Fe, Zn, and Mn. However, the high level of some of the TEs (Mn, Cd, and Cr) may reflect the increase of local and global human activities.","output":"Factors that influence trace element levels in blood and feathers of Pygoscelis penguins from South Shetland Islands, Antarctica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of single stranded RNA viruses, of which some of them such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are associated with deadly worldwide human diseases. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a condition caused by SARS-CoV-2, results in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high mortality in the elderly and in people with underlying comorbidities. Results from several studies suggest that CoVs localize in mitochondria and interact with mitochondrial protein translocation machinery to target their encoded products to mitochondria. Coronaviruses encode a number of proteins; this process is essential for viral replication through inhibiting degradation of viral proteins and host misfolded proteins including those in mitochondria. These viruses seem to maintain their replication by altering mitochondrial dynamics and targeting mitochondrial-associated antiviral signaling (MAVS), allowing them to evade host innate immunity. Coronaviruses infections such as COVID-19 are more severe in aging patients. Since endogenous melatonin levels are often dramatically reduced in the aged and because it is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin has been proposed to be useful in CoVs infections by altering proteasomal and mitochondrial activities. Melatonin inhibits mitochondrial fission due to its antioxidant and inhibitory effects on cytosolic calcium overload. The collective data suggests that melatonin may mediate mitochondrial adaptations through regulating both mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis. We propose that melatonin may inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damage by regulating mitochondrial physiology.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses negatively influence mitochondrial quality control: beneficial effects of melatonin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, it was confirmed that ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing the recent outbreak of severe pneumonia around the world.

Therefore, we hypothesized that there could be some other genes playing key roles in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. Here we found that AGTR2 (angiotensin II receptor type 2), a G-protein coupled receptor, has interaction with ACE2 and is highly expressed in lung with a high tissue specificity. More importantly, simulation of 3D structure based protein-protein interaction reveals that AGTR2 shows a higher binding affinity with the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 than ACE2 (energy: -8.2 vs. -5.1 [kcal/mol]). A number of compounds, biologics and traditional Chinese medicine that could decrease the expression level of AGTR2 were predicted.

DESIGN Case report. SETTING University hospital. PATIENT(S) A 36-year-old amenorrheic patient was referred for fertility preservation (FP) counseling with a diagnosis of autoimmune POI. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (21.0 and 36.3 mIU/mL) and luteinizing hormone (35.0 and 60.0 mIU/mL) levels taken 4 weeks apart were around the menopausal range. Although serum antimllerian hormone level was low (0.76 and 0.65 ng/mL), total counts of antral follicles remained unexpectedly normal (24 and 22). Significant levels of serum antiperoxidase, anti-21-hydroxylase, and antiovary antibodies led to the diagnosis of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy. Due to the unknown time before follicular exhaustion, we undertook a FP program. INTERVENTION(S) After unsuccessful follicular growth following a trial of ovarian stimulation using recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (300 IU/day for 10 days), we decided to try IVM of immature oocytes aspirated from the remaining antral-stage follicles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Obtention of immature oocyte capable of maturing in vitro in a context of acute ovarian dysfunction. RESULT(S) Two cycles of IVM were performed, leading, after human chorionic gonadotropin priming, to six and 10 cumulus-oocyte complexes recovered and four and eight metaphase II oocytes. Finally, after intracytoplasmic sperm injection, a total of eight cleavage-stage embryos were frozen. When the patient presented in the clinic 1 year later for reutilization of the cryopreserved embryos, thyroid and adrenal functions were controlled with levothyroxine and hydrocortisone. Endometrium was primed with 17?-estradiol (2 mg/day, vaginally) for 14 days. Progesterone (600 mg/day, vaginally) was subsequently combined with E2. Two embryos were thawed and further transferred into the uterus. The patient became pregnant and uneventfully delivered two baby boys at term. CONCLUSION(S) We report the first pregnancy and live birth achieved using IVM for FP in a woman diagnosed with autoimmune POI. The confirmation of our results would lead to modification in the management of young women diagnosed with autoimmune POI, who are usually not considered candidates for FP and often referred for egg donation when seeking pregnancy.","output":"In vitro maturation of oocytes for preserving fertility in autoimmune premature ovarian insufficiency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There is limited information in literature on how coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period affects people with asthma. This study aimed to compare levels of physical activity, stress, and fear and quality of life and sleep quality between patients with asthma and healthy individuals during the pandemic. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with asthma and 22 healthy individuals aged between 18 and 65 years were included. Physical activity level using \\"International Physical Activity Questionnaire\\"; stress level, using \\"Perceived Stress Scale-14\\"; fear level, using \\"Fear of COVID-19 Scale\\"; sleep quality, using \\"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index\\"; and quality of life, using \\"World Health Organization Quality of Life\\" were evaluated. RESULTS: Total physical activity level, vigorous physical activity level, and walking score of patients with asthma were lower than healthy individuals (p < .05). Sitting time of patients with asthma was higher than healthy individuals (p < .05).

RESULTS: An 18-item questionnaire was submitted to the 56 members of the Thoracic subcommittee of the SIAARTI Cardio-Thoraco-Vascular Research Group to provide a snapshot of current situation and national variability of devices and procedures for airway management during the COVID-19 pandemic. The response rate was 64%. Eighty-three percent of anesthetists declared that they modified their airway management strategies. The Hospital Management considered necessary to provide a complete level 3 personal protective equipment for thoracic anesthetists only in 47% of cases. Double-lumen tube and bronchial blocker were preferred by 53% and 22% of responders to achieve one-lung ventilation respectively. Over 90% of responders considered the videolaryngoscope with separate screen and rapid sequence induction/intubation useful to minimize the infection risk. Thirty-nine percent of participants considered mandatory the bronchoscopic check of airway devices. Vivasight-DL was considered comfortable by more than 50% of responders while protective box and plastic drape were judged as uncomfortable by most of anesthetists.

The present study aimed to test the efficacy of nasal lavages in upper airways symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A series of consecutive adult subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from December 2020 to February 2021 performed daily nasal lavages with saline solution (Lavonase?Purling, Lugo di Romagna, Italy) for 12 days, starting on the day after the SARS-CoV-2 positive swab. A control group included a historical series of patients who were infected in February-March 2020 and who did not perform lavages. An ad hoc questionnaire regarding symptoms was administered to each subjects at base-line and 10 days after diagnosis (i.e., on the same day of the control swab) in both cases and controls. Results: A total of 140 subjects were enrolled. 68 participants in the treatment group and 72 in the control group were included. 90% of respondents declared the lavages were simple to use and 70% declared they were satisfied. Symptoms of blocked nose, runny nose, or sneezing decreased by an average of 24.7% after the treatment. Blocked nose and sneezing increased in the same period of time in the control group.

Even though numerous treatments and vaccines to combat this virus are currently under development, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease are yet to be elucidated to design future therapeutic tools against SARS-CoV-2 variants. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (20-24 nucleotides), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. Recently, it has been demonstrated that both host and viral-encoded miRNAs are crucial for the successful infection of SARS-CoV-2. For instance, dysregulation of miRNAs that modulate multiple genes expressed in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, lung adenocarcinoma, and cerebrovascular disorders) could affect the severity of the disease. Thus, altered expression levels of circulating miRNAs might be helpful to diagnose this illness and forecast whether a COVID-19 patient could develop a severe state of the disease. Besides, researchers have found a number of miRNAs could inhibit the expression of proteins such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, spike, and Nsp12, involved in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, miRNAs represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this devastating viral disease.

SARS-CoV-2 autoimmune-mediated inflammation have been reported, but the existence of autoantibodies against apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-apoA-1 IgG) in COVID-19 remains unexplored. Anti-apoA-1 IgGs have emerged as an independent biomarker for cardiovascular disease and mortality in humans with proinflammatory and proatherogenic functions in vivo and in vitro. Purpose:We want to determine i) the degree of homology between SARSCoV-2, apoA-1, and Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) epitopes, ii) the association between anti-SARSCoV2 and anti-apoA-1 IgGs, and iii) their relationship to prognosis. Methods: We performed bioinformatics modelling coupled with mimetic peptides engineering, as well as functional and competition assays with antibodies to identify molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2, apoA-1 and TLR2 epitopes. Anti-Spike domain 1 (SD1) IgGs, anti-apoA-1 IgGs and against mimic peptides, as well as cytokines were assessed by immunoassays on a case-control (n=101), an intensive care unit (ICU;n=126) with a 28-days follow-up for overall mortality, and a general population cohort (n=663) with available samples in the pre and post-pandemic period. Results: Linear sequence homologies and antibodies cross-reactivity between apoA-1, TLR2, and Spike epitopes were identified. Overall, antiapoA-1 IgG levels were higher in COVID-19 patients or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals than in healthy donors or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals (p<0.0001). Significant and similar associations were noted between anti-apoA-1, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, cytokines, and lipid profile. In ICU patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-apoA-1 seroconversion rates displayed similar 7-days kinetics, reaching 82% for anti-apoA-1 seropositivity. C-statistics (CS) indicated that baseline anti-Spike/TLR2 mimic-peptide IgGs displayed a significant prognostic accuracy for overall mortality at 28 days (CS: 0.64;p=0.02). In the general population, SARSCoV-2 exposure increased baseline anti-apoA-1 IgG levels.

Infectivity of Calu-3 cells depended on the cell line assayed. If Calu-3/2B4 was used, EC50 was 7 nM, but in the ATCC Calu-3 cell line without ACE2 enrichment, EC50 was >10 M. There was no toxicity to any of the host cell lines at 10-100 M K777 concentration. Kinetic analysis confirmed that K777 was a potent inhibitor of human cathepsin L, whereas no inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine proteases (papain-like and 3CL-like protease) was observed. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with a propargyl derivative of K777 as an activity-based probe identified human cathepsin B and cathepsin L as the intracellular targets of this molecule in both infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells. However, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was only carried out by cathepsin L. This cleavage was blocked by K777 and occurred in the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a different site from that previously observed for the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein.

According to the clinical classification, the patients were divided into severe group and critical group. The myocardial injury markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myoglobin (MYO), MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 55 COVID-19 patients were selected, including 15 critical cases and 40 severe cases. The patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were male-dominated (61.8%), the average age was (61.213.0) years old, 83.6% (46 cases) of them had contact history of Hubei, 38.2% (21 cases) of them were complicated with hypertension. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the critical group and the severe group. Myocardial injury markers of critical and severe COVID-19 patients were increased in different proportion, LDH increased in most patients (20 severe cases and 7 critical cases), followed by AST (16 severe cases and 5 critical cases). There was significant difference in the number of patients with elevated CK between severe group and critical group (cases: 1 vs. 4, P = 0.027).

METHODS The COVID-19 treatment schemes were formed in accordance with the national and regional guidelines at the time of admittance, which were mainly based on the use of hydroxychloroquine and other drugs. The sample consisted exclusively of inpatients, and all patients were enrolled in the study regardless of their specific diagnosis or treatment schemes. RESULTS 4 out of 23 patients (17.4%) had experienced adverse effects, two of which had mild hepatic enzyme elevation and one had mild sinus bradycardia. Of note is that we haven't encountered any serious complications or life-threatening events during inpatient treatment. The most emphasised adverse effect in the literature, namely QTc prolongation and ECG changes, were not observed in our sample. The adverse effects were not found to be significantly associated with patient-related factors nor dose of antipsychotic medication.

In addition, suggestions are made for further regional air pollution control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Key results are as follows: Overall, the AQI and the concentrations of six air pollutants, especially SO2, PM10, and NO2, were lower during control period than during the equivalent period in 2019 (reductions of 26.5%, 24.3%, and 16.9%, respectively). From the before to later stages, pollutants (except O3) showed a downward trend while O3 increased significantly during the before stage (by 76.2%) and the growth rate slowed during the middle and later stages; During the prior stage, Beijing experienced two periods with heavy air pollution days as a result of the local accumulation of pollutants, secondary transformation, and regional transport.

While research on contemplative practices such as mindfulness has seen a large increase of studies in recent years, research into the psychological effects related to the practice of the EC has been largely ignored in the scientific literature. On the other hand, on a careful historical and philosophical analysis, it appears evident that references to it abound in many cultural contexts and in different eras. Here, we examined the effects of a 2-week program of this practice that participants performed using a digital application developed ad hoc for this experiment. A control group performed an activity of the same duration, also with the support of a digital application, but which consisted of listening to audio excerpts of an Italian literary novel. Measurements taken from both groups before and after the 2-week period consisted of self-assessments of metamemory capacity, that is, awareness and knowledge of their own memory processes. Results showed that participants reported a significant decrease in two properties of their metamemory after training, specifically vividness and coherence. No other significant changes were found between the two groups. Specifically, we found no differences in other metamemory characteristics, no differences in prospective or retrospective memory, and no differences in changes in stress levels. These results, although preliminary, suggest that a relatively short period of EC does indeed make people metacognitively more aware of the limitations and errors of their memory, in particular concerning vividness and coherence.","output":"The Examination of Conscience: A Preliminary Study on the Effects on Metamemory After a 2-Week Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cholesterol is known to play an important role in stabilizing particular cellular membrane structures, so-called lipid or membrane rafts. For several viruses, a dependence on cholesterol for virus entry and/or morphogenesis has been shown. Using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that infection of cells by canine distemper virus (CDV) was not impaired after cellular cholesterol had been depleted by the drug methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This effect was independent of the multiplicity of infection and the cellular receptor used for infection. However, cholesterol depletion of the viral envelope significantly reduced CDV infectivity. Replenishment by addition of exogenous cholesterol restored infectivity up to 80%. Thus, we conclude that CDV entry is dependent on cholesterol in the viral envelope. Furthermore, reduced syncytium formation was observed when the cells were cholesterol depleted during the course of the infection. This may be related to the observation that CDV envelope proteins H and F partitioned into cellular detergent-resistant membranes. Therefore, a role for lipid rafts during virus assembly and release as well is suggested.","output":"Canine distemper virus infection requires cholesterol in the viral envelope."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Oral anticoagulation therapy was the mainstay of deep vein thrombosis treatment but recently, catheter-directed thrombolysis has emerged as an alternative.

Forecasting of admissions can help for the efficient organisation of hospital care. We aimed to forecast the number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and we compared the performance of machine learning models and time series models. This would eventually allow to support timely resource allocation for optimal treatment of patients. Methods We used admission data from 9 psychiatric hospitals in Germany between 2017 and 2020. We compared machine learning models with time series models in weekly, monthly and yearly forecasting before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our models were trained and validated with data from the first two years and tested in prospectively sliding time-windows in the last two years. Results A total of 90,686 admissions were analysed. The models explained up to 90% of variance in hospital admissions in 2019 and 75% in 2020 with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The best models substantially outperformed a one-step seasonal naive forecast (seasonal mean absolute scaled error (sMASE) 2019: 0.59, 2020: 0.76). The best model in 2019 was a machine learning model (elastic net, mean absolute error (MAE): 7.25). The best model in 2020 was a time series model (exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors and trend and seasonal components, MAE: 10.44), which adjusted more quickly to the shock effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Models forecasting admissions one week in advance did not perform better than monthly and yearly models in 2019 but they did in 2020. The most important features for the machine learning models were calendrical variables. Conclusion Model performance did not vary much between different modelling approaches before the COVID-19 pandemic and established forecasts were substantially better than one-step seasonal naive forecasts. However, weekly time series models adjusted quicker to the COVID-19 related shock effects. In practice, different forecast horizons could be used simultaneously to allow both early planning and quick adjustments to external effects.","output":"Forecasting admissions in psychiatric hospitals before and during Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quick, early, and precise detection is important for diagnosis to control the spread of COVID-19 infection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology could certainly be used as a modulating tool to ease the detection, and help with the preventive steps further. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many visual recognition tasks. Nevertheless, most of these state-of-the-art networks highly rely on the availability of a high amount of labeled data, being an essential step in supervised machine learning tasks. Conventionally, this manual, mundane, and time-consuming process of annotating images is done by humans. Learning to localize or detect COVID-19 infection masks in our specific case study typically requires the collection of CT scan data that has been labeled with bounding boxes or similar annotations, which generally is limited. A technique that could perform such learning with much less annotations, and transfer the learned proposals that are algorithm-driven to generate more synthetic annotated samples would be helpful And quite valuable. We present such a technique inspired by weakly trained mask region based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) architecture for localization, in which the number of images with their pixel-level masks can be a small proportion of the total dataset, and then further improvise CNNs by inversely generating dense annotations on-the-go using an algorithmic-based computational approach. We focus on alleviating the bottleneck associated with deep learning models needing annotated data for training in an intuitive reverse engineering fashion through this work. Our proposed solution can certainly provide the prospect of automated labeling on-the-fly, thereby reducing much of the manual work. As a result, one can quickly train a precise COVID-19 infection detector with the leverage of autonomous frame-by-frame machine generated annotations. The model achieved mean precision accuracy (%) of 0.99, 0.931, and 0.8 for train, validation, and test set, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can be adopted in a clinical setting for assisting radiologists, and also our fully autonomous approach can be generalized to any detection/recognition tasks at ease.

Many studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are effective in treating COVID-19. However, it is difficult to find the most effective combination herbal pair among numerous herbs, as well as identifying its potential mechanisms. Herbal pair is the main form of a combination of TCM herbs, which is widely used for the treatment of diseases. It can also help us to better understand the compatibility of TCM prescriptions, thus improving the curative effects. The purpose of this article is to explore the compatibility of TCM prescriptions and identify the most important herbal pair for the treatment of COVID-19, and then analyze the active components and potential mechanisms of this herbal pair. METHODS: We first systematically sorted the TCM prescriptions recommended by the leading experts for treating COVID-19, and the specific herbs contained in these prescriptions across different stages of the disease. Next, the association rule approach was employed to examine the distribution and compatibility among these TCM prescriptions, and then identify the most important herbal pair. On this basis, we further investigated the active ingredients and potential targets in the selected herbal pair by a network pharmacology approach, and analyzed the potential mechanisms against COVID-19. Finally, the main active compounds in the herbal pair were selected for molecular docking with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) 3CLpro and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) for further verification. RESULT: We obtained 32 association rules for the herbal combinations in the selection of TCM treatment for COVID-19. The results showed that the combination of Amygdalus Communis Vas (ACV) and Ephedra sinica Stapf (ESS) had the highest confidence degree and lift value, as well as high support degree, which can be used in almost all the stages of COVID-19, so ACV and ESS (AE) were selected as the most important herbal pair. There were 26 active ingredients and 44 potential targets, which might be related to the herbal pair of AE against COVID-19. The main active ingredients of AE against COVID-19 were quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, while the potential targets were Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK)1, MAPK8, Interleukin-1 (IL-1), and Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) p65 subunit (RELA). The protein-protein interaction (PPI) cluster demonstrated that IL-6 was the seed in the cluster, which plays an important role in connecting other nodes in the PPI network. The potential pathways mainly involved tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Toll-like receptor (TLR), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLRs). The molecular docking results showed that the main active ingredients of AE have good affinity with SARS-COV-2 3CLpro and ACE2, which are consistent with the above analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There were 32 association rules in the TCM prescriptions recommended by experts for COVID-19. The combination of ACV and EAS was the most important herbal pair for the treatment of COVID-19. AE might have therapeutic effects against COVID-19 by affecting the inflammatory and immune responses, cell apoptosis, hypoxia damage and other pathological processes through multiple components, targets and pathways.","output":"The important herbal pair for the treatment of COVID-19 and its possible mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"South Korea is experiencing the community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529).

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the outcomes of menthol cigarette bans on youth menthol cigarette smoking and to characterize youth menthol cigarette smokers in terms of demographics and cigarette consumption and dependence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study uses data from online repeat cross-sectional International Tobacco Control Youth Tobacco and Vaping Surveys conducted in 2018, 2019, February 2020, and August 2020. Participants included past 30-day smokers aged 16 to 19 years. Data analysis was performed from March 2021 to January 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Usually smoke a brand of cigarettes that was menthol, including capsule. EXPOSURES: Menthol cigarette ban, comparing 3 countries over time: Canada, where a ban already existed, England, where a ban was implemented during the study, and the US, where no national ban was present. Age, sex, race, and consumption and dependence were also examined by menthol smoking in each country, and in England before vs after the ban. RESULTS: The analytical sample comprised 7067 participants aged 16 to 19 years, of whom 4129 were female and 5019 were White. In England, the weighted percentage of youth smokers who reported smoking a menthol or capsule cigarette brand was stable in the 3 survey waves before the menthol ban (2018 to February 2020, 9.4% vs 12.1%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.99-1.06; P = .15) but decreased to 3.0% after the ban (February 2020 vs August 2020, AOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.10; P < .001).

Commonly used phylogenetic trees based on alignments can be used to visualize only a limited number of protein sequences. DGraph, introduced here, is an application developed to generate 2-dimensional (2D) maps based on similarity scores for sequences. The program automatically calculates and graphically displays property distance (PD) scores based on physico-chemical property (PCP) similarities from an unaligned list of FASTA files. Such \\"PD-graphs\\" show the interrelatedness of the sequences, whereby clusters can reveal deeper connectivities. Results: Property distance graphs generated for flavivirus (FV), enterovirus (EV), and coronavirus (CoV) sequences from complete polyproteins or individual proteins are consistent with biological data on vector types, hosts, cellular receptors, and disease phenotypes. Property distance graphs separate the tick- from the mosquito-borne FV, cluster viruses that infect bats, camels, seabirds, and humans separately. The clusters correlate with disease phenotype. The PD method segregates the -CoV spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) sequences from other human pathogenic CoV, with clustering consistent with cellular receptor usage. The graphs also suggest evolutionary relationships that may be difficult to determine with conventional bootstrapping methods that require postulating an ancestral sequence.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of anxiety, depression and stress related to COVID-19 pandemic on disease activity of HAE patients during the quarantine period (QP) and the return to normal period (RTNP). Methods: This prospective study was conducted between March 2020 and September 2020 in four allergy centres. Demographic, clinical features and mental health status were evaluated in QP (from March to the beginning of June) and RTNP (from June to the beginning of September) was applied by the government. The 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS10) was used to define the severity of HAE attacks. Depression-Anxiety- Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Fear of Covid-19 (FC-19) scales were performed to assess mental health status. Results: 139 HAE patients were included in the study. In QP, median attack numbers and median VAS10 scores were 5 (min-max: 0-45) and 6 (min-max: 0-10), respectively. HAE attack numbers, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, depression and total DASS-21 scores, as well as FC-19 scores were higher in QP than RTNP (p= 0.001, p <0,001, p = 0,001, p <0,001, p <0.001, p<0.001, respectively). However, there was no difference in attack severity scores between the two periods (p>0.05).

RECENT FINDINGS Studies have predominantly come from researchers in the UK and Australia. Major themes include questioning the scope and content of harm reduction strategies and identifying approaches to improve engagement between the androgen using community and healthcare providers. Findings suggest that a broader range of interventions and forms of advice are needed than are commonly provided. This must be supported by efforts to increase opportunities to deliver harm reduction through new engagement approaches, better relationships with health professionals and more guidance on identifying and managing associated adverse health impacts. SUMMARY A fully developed harm reduction-based response to nonmedical androgen use will be one that not only seeks to reduce risk of bloodborne virus transmission and injecting-related harms, but that considers the range of needs amongst the diverse community of androgen users and respects their decisions and rights. Co-producing interventions with members of this community will help develop effective and engaging approaches.

Objectives To describe urban-rural disparity in UGIC and to emphasize prevention by socioeconomic development and urbanization in China. Methods Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of cancers in 2012 were compared between urban Shijiazhuang city and rural Shexian County, and trends from 2000-2015 in Shexian County were analyzed. Findings Compared with urban Shijiazhuang city, the ASR of gastroesophageal cancers in rural Shexian County was 5.3 times higher in men (234.1 vs 44.2/100,000, P < .01) and 9.1 times higher in women (107.7 vs 11.8/100,000, P < .01). This rural-urban disparity in UGIC is associated with differences in socioeconomic development in annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$2700 vs US$6965, in urbanization rate of 48% vs 100%, and in adult Helicobacter pylori infection prevalence of 75% vs 50%. From 2000-2015, the GDP per capita in Shexian County increased from US$860 to US$3000, urbanization rate increased from 22.4% to 54.8%, and prevalence of H pylori infection among 3- to 10-year-old children decreased from 60% to 46.1% (P < .01). Meanwhile, the biennial ASR of esophagogastric cancer decreased 42% in men, from 313.5 to 182.1 per 100,000 (P < .01), and 57% in women, from 188.6 to 80.4 per 100,000 (P = .00). However, lung, colorectal, and gallbladder cancers and leukemia in both sexes and breast, ovary, thyroid, and kidney cancer in women increased significantly. Despite this offset, ASR of all cancers combined decreased 25% in men (from 378.2 to 283.0/100,000, P = .00) and 19% in women (from 238.5 to 193.6/100,000, P = .00).

METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional survey of people with SCI (N = 207), who were in active in-patient rehabilitation from two tertiary SCI Rehabilitation Centres in Bangladesh. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews, after voluntary consent, using a pretested, language validated questionnaire on Knowledge, Attitude and Behavioural practises (KAP) and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21). Ethical approval and trial registration were obtained prospectively. RESULTS: A total of 207 people with SCI responded, among which 87% were men and 13% were women, with a mean age of 34.18  12.9 years. Within the sample group, people living with tetraplegia comprised 33.8%, and people living with paraplegia comprised 66.2%. Overall, 63.8% of the participants were diagnosed with an SCI categorised as ASIA-A. Overall, the knowledge score was 8.59  2.3 out of 12, depression was 11.18  8, anxiety was 7.72  5.1, and stress was 9.32  6.7 from a total of 21 scores each category. The strong correlation was between knowledge, DASS scores, and age (p < 0.05). In addition, there was a strong correlation between knowledge, gender (p < 0.05) and education (p < 0.01). Binary logistic regression found a stronger association of knowledge and DASS scores with gender, young age, illiteracy (p < 0.01), and rural residence (p < 0.05). A positive relationship was found between depression and anxiety scores (p < 0.01) and a moderate positive relationship was found between depression and stress scores (p < 0.01). A positive attitude was reported by the majority of participants (p < 0.05). In terms of behavioural practises, participants reported both self and caregiver had followed health advice with regard to consulting health professionals (65.7%), implementing isolation (63.8%), taking droplet precaution care (87.4%), and hygiene care (90.3%).

Although detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater may be prompted with good recoveries during periods of high community prevalence, in the early stages of population outbreaks concentration procedures are required to overcome low viral concentrations. Several methods have become available for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from raw wastewater, generally involving filtration. However, these methods are limited to small sample volumes, possibly missing the early stages of virus circulation, and restrained applicability across different water matrices. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the performance of three methods enabling the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 from large volumes of wastewater: i) hollow fiber filtration using the inuvai R180, with an enhanced elution protocol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation; ii) PEG precipitation; and iii) skimmed milk flocculation. The performance of the three approaches was evaluated in wastewater from multiple wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with distinct singularities, according to: i) effective volume; ii) percentage of recovery; iii) extraction efficiency; iv) inhibitory effect; and v) the limits of detection and quantification (The inuvai R180 system had the best performance, with detection of spiked controls across all samples, average recovery percentages of 64% for SARS-CoV-2 control and 68% for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), with low variability.

Given the relationship between sleep and dementia, addressing sleep issues may offer an opportunity to treat reversible causes. There are two primary treatments for insomnia: behavioral-based (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, CBT-I) and pharmacological interventions. Although CBT-I is recommended as first-line treatment for insomnia in older adults, sedative-hypnotics are more likely to be recommended than non-pharmacological treatments given their convenience and accessibility. However, there are significant concerns in prescribing medications to patients with MCI. To explore this disconnect, we reviewed insomnia treatments in older adults with MCI studies and current guidelines of pharmacological therapy. First, we reviewed studies presenting non-pharmacological treatment of insomnia in older adults with MCI. Although the search yielded over 4,000 non-duplicate titles, only one article presented data on non-pharmacological treatment of insomnia in MCI. The literature covering comorbid insomnia, CBT-I, and MCI is sparse. In contrast to review of non-pharmacological studies, studies on the pharmacological treatment of insomnia in older adults were ample. Finally, we reviewed international guidelines for pharmacological treatment of insomnia in cognitive disorders. More widely used pharmacological interventions show short-term effectiveness with problems of recurrence, ineffectiveness in inadvertent or purposeful chronic use, and adverse side effects. Despite evidence regarding adverse consequences, pharmacological treatment of insomnia remains the most common treatment for insomnia. Reflecting on age-related changes in older adults, particularly those with MCI, inappropriate or mismanagement of medication can lead to unnecessary complications.

The authors assessed the effectiveness of these NINDS-initiated programs to increase the number of independent NIH-funded neurosurgeon-scientists and grow NIH neurosurgery research funding. METHODS NIH funding data for faculty and clinical department funding were derived from the NIH, academic departments, and Blue Ridge Institute of Medical Research databases from 2006 to 2019. RESULTS Between 2009 and 2019, the NINDS R25 funded 87 neurosurgical residents. Fifty-three (61%) have completed the award and training, and 39 (74%) are in academic practice. Compared to neurosurgeons who did not receive R25 funding, R25 awardees were twice as successful (64% vs 31%) in obtaining K-series awards and received the K-series award in a significantly shorter period of time after training (25.2  10.1 months vs 53.9  23.0 months; p < 0.004). Between 2013 and 2019, the NINDS K12 has supported 19 neurosurgeons. Thirteen (68%) have finished their K12 support and all (100%) have applied for federal funding. Eleven (85%) have obtained major individual NIH grant support. Since the establishment of these two programs, the number of unique neurosurgeons supported by either individual (R01 or DP-series) or collaborative (U- or P-series) NIH grants increased from 36 to 82 (a 2.3-fold increase). Overall, NIH funding to clinical neurological surgery departments between 2006 and 2019 increased from $66.9 million to $157.3 million (a 2.2-fold increase).

The diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch is a reasonable predictor of stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and its clinical usefulness in selecting patients for thrombolysis is currently being investigated. The accuracy of the visual mismatch rating is moderate, and we hypothesized that the predictive value of stroke onset within 4.5 hours could be improved by including various clinical and imaging parameters. METHODS In this study, 141 patients in whom magnetic resonance imaging was obtained within 9 hours after symptom onset were included. Relative FLAIR signal intensity was calculated in the region of nonreperfused core. Mean Tmax was calculated in the total region with Tmax >6 s. Mean relative FLAIR, mean Tmax, lesion volume with Tmax >6 s, age, site of arterial stenosis, core volume, and location of infarct were analyzed by logistic regression to predict stroke onset time before or after 4.5 hours. RESULTS Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.59-0.78) for the visual diffusion-weighted imaging/FLAIR mismatch, thereby correctly classifying 69% of patients with an onset time before or after 4.5 hours. Age, relative FLAIR, and Tmax increased the accuracy significantly (P<0.01) to an area under the curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.74-0.89). This new predictive model correctly categorized 77% of patients according to stroke onset before versus after 4.5 hours. CONCLUSIONS In patients with unknown stroke onset, the accuracy of predicting time from symptom onset within 4.5 hours is improved by obtaining relative FLAIR and perfusion imaging.","output":"Prediction of Stroke Onset Is Improved by Relative Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery and Perfusion Imaging Compared to the Visual Diffusion-Weighted Imaging/Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Mismatch."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the fall of 2001, the national public health system found itself responding to acts of terrorism.

Although typically described with characteristic symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, greater understanding of COVID-19 has revealed myriad clinical manifestations. Olfactory dysfunction (OD)-hyposmia and anosmia-has recently been recognized as an important symptom of COVID-19 and increasingly gained traction as a public health tool for identifying COVID-19 patients, in particular otherwise asymptomatic carriers who, unawares, may be major drivers of disease spread. The objective of this study is to review the scientific evidence about anosmia in COVID-19. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS Comprehensive literature search of primary studies pertinent to the objectives of this review using the chosen data sources. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence shows that OD is highly prevalent in COVID-19, with up to 80% of patients reporting subjective OD and objective olfactory testing potentially showing even higher prevalence. OD is frequently accompanied by taste dysfunction. Up to 25% of COVID-19 patients may experience sudden-onset OD as the first symptom. A large proportion of COVID-19 OD cases may resolve over the period of a few weeks. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Sudden anosmia should be considered a symptom of COVID-19. Assessing for sudden-onset anosmia may increase sensitivity of COVID-19 screening strategies, in particular for identifying patients at the earliest stages of disease. Since many cases of OD due to COVID-19 may resolve in the short term, conservative management, including observation, is reasonable, while advanced imaging is unnecessary.","output":"Olfactory Dysfunction: A Highly Prevalent Symptom of COVID-19 With Public Health Significance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: For several weeks in March and April 2020, New York City was the global epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak Minority populations in the Bronx were disproportionately affected Since the beginning of the outbreak, there has been speculation that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may worsen outcomes among patients with COVID-19 Methods: This was a retrospective case series We included patients &gt;= 16 years with COVID-19 who presented to one of five EDs between March 9, 2020 and April 4, 2020 in the New York City borough of the Bronx The population was largely Black and Hispanic Included were 1,122 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 22 COVID-negative cases in which the clinical suspicion for disease remained high despite negative testing Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was performed with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on nasopharyngeal swab specimens We abstracted data from the medical record on whether the patient had a current prescription for an ACE-I or ARB, as well as data on hypertension (HTN), diabetes (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) Clinical outcomes included death, ICU admission, and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) We determined inter-rater reliability for 10% of the data We report Spearmans rho and p values for each variable and clinical outcomes We performed a logistic regression model in which death was the primary outcome and each of the predictor variables listed above were entered and retained in the model P = 16 years old admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 after controlling for medical comorbidities","output":"149 Association of ACE-I and ARB Prescriptions With Mortality in Patients Admitted to the Hospital With COVID-19 in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most current anomaly detection methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality when dealing with high-dimensional data.

However, the effectiveness of chart rounds in detecting problematic treatment plans is unknown. We performed a prospective blinded study of error detection at chart rounds to clarify the effectiveness of this quality assurance step. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System publications were queried for problematic plans approved for treatment that would be detectable at chart rounds. A resident physician, physicist, and dosimetrist collaboratively generated 20 treatment plans with simulated errors identical in nature to those reported to the Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System. These were inserted randomly into weekly chart rounds over 9 weeks, with a median of 2 problematic plans presented per chart rounds (range, 1-4). Data were collected on detection, attendance, length, and number of cases presented at chart rounds. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and univariable logistic regression with odds ratios. RESULTS: The median length of chart rounds over the study period was 60 minutes (range, 42-79); median number of cases presented per chart rounds was 45 (range, 38-50). The overall detection rate was 55% (11 of 20). Detection rates were higher for cases presented earlier in chart rounds: 75% versus 25% of problematic plans were detected within 30 minutes of start of chart rounds versus after 30 minutes (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.88; P = .037).

Each month's absolute percentage error (APE) between the actual value and model-predicted value of each STD in 2020 was calculated to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic on the STDs. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to explore the confirmed COVID-19 case numbers and the COVID-19 control measures' correlations with the case numbers and the APEs of five STDs in 2020. Results: The actual number of five STDs in China was more than 50% lower than the predicted number in the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic, especially in February. Among them, the actual number of cases of hepatitis C, gonorrhea, and syphilis in February 2020 was more than 100% lower than the predicted number (APE was ?102.3, ?109.0, and ?100.4%, respectively). After the sharply declines of STDs' reported cases in early 2020, the case numbers recovered quickly after March. The epidemic of STDs was negatively associated with the COVID-19 epidemic and its control measures, especially for restrictions on gathering size, close public transport, and stay-at-home requirements (p < 0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 had a significant but temporary influence on the STD epidemic in China. The effective control of COVID-19 is vital for STD prevention. STD services need to be improved to prevent STDs from becoming a secluded corner in the shadow of COVID-19.","output":"The Epidemic of Sexually Transmitted Diseases Under the Influence of COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o: A pandemia pela COVID-19 em Minas Gerais (MG) acarretou na redu??o da procura por atendimentos mdicos, como consultas ambulatoriais, exames e cirurgias eletivas, em resposta s estratgias de contingncia.

Public universities in urban centers represent a substantial proportion of college students in the USA. We implemented a cross-sectional population-based online survey of 2282 students in a large, public university in New York City in April 2020. We created weights to account for non-response and used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with mental health outcomes. Students experienced high rates of anxiety/depression and financial instability due to the pandemic. Half of the students reported anxiety/depression (54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (81.1%) reported loss of household income, and half (49.8%) reported worries about losing housing. High levels of food (aPR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6) and housing (aPR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) insecurity were the strongest predictors of anxiety/depression. Household and personal experiences with possible COVID-19 symptoms were also associated with anxiety/depression or the need for increased mental health services. Addressing student needs at public urban universities requires an integrated holistic approach that targets urgent mental health and economic needs related to the impact of COVID-19. Students who become infected need mental health services as well as health monitoring.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Students Health and Financial Stability in New York City: Findings from a Population-Based Sample of City University of New York (CUNY) Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Thrombus characteristics and collateral score are associated with functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. It has been suggested that they affect each other. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between clot burden score, thrombus perviousness, and collateral score and to determine whether collateral score influences the association of thrombus characteristics with functional outcome. METHODS Patients with baseline thin-slice noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography images from the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) were included (n=195). Collateral score and clot burden scores were determined on baseline computed tomographic angiography. Thrombus attenuation increase was determined by comparing thrombus density on noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography using a semiautomated method. The association of collateral score with clot burden score and thrombus attenuation increase was evaluated with linear regression. Mediation and effect modification analyses were used to assess the influence of collateral score on the association of clot burden score and thrombus attenuation increase with functional outcome. RESULTS A higher clot burden score (B=0.063; 95% confidence interval, 0.008-0.118) and a higher thrombus attenuation increase (B=0.014; 95% confidence interval, 0.003-0.026) were associated with higher collateral score. Collateral score mediated the association of clot burden score with functional outcome. The association between thrombus attenuation increase and functional outcome was modified by the collateral score, and this association was stronger in patients with moderate and good collaterals. CONCLUSIONS Patients with lower thrombus burden and higher thrombus perviousness scores had higher collateral score. The positive effect of thrombus perviousness on clinical outcome was only present in patients with moderate and high collateral scores. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.trialregister.nl.

In normal situations and the long-term horizon, green bonds and black bonds have similar impacts with each other, with a slight predominance of black bonds. From the dynamic connectedness results, the sample period is classified into three stages. The first stage is a period with equal role of green and black bonds from Jan 2018 to Feb 2020, which is regarded as a normal situation of the bond market. The second stage is the unbalanced period with a turning point of the Covid-19, with the increased gap of the connectedness exported by green and black bonds. The third stage is the recovery period after Oct 2020, with the role of green and black bonds recovered slowly to the equal status. In addition, the green-to-black connectedness in longer term witnesses faster and stronger recovery, which suggests that the long-term influences of green bonds are relatively stable than the short-term influences. Moreover, the paper tests the effects of the same issuer. Our analysis shows that there are strong connections among bonds in the Philippines that are issued by the same institution. However, the same issuer is not a sufficient condition for a strong connectedness. Furthermore, our analysis in China Mainland, reveals that the green policy will firstly cause the change of green bonds price and then spillover the impact to conventional markets. Through the study of the drivers of connectedness dynamics in four directions (green-to-green, black-to-black, green-to-black, black-to-green), we present empirical findings that are crucial for investors and policymakers in risk management, hedging strategy, and green investment acceleration.","output":"Go green or stay black: Bond market dynamics in Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New Schiff bases {N'-(phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methylene) isonicotinohydrazide (L1H), N1 -(naphthalen-1-yl)-N2 -(phenyl(pyridin-2-yl) methylidene) ethane-1,2-diamine (L2H), N-(6-chlorobenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-phenyl-1-(pyridin-2-yl) methanimine (L3H)}were synthesized by reaction of 2-benzoylpyridine with different amines (2-amino-6-chlorobenzothiazole, isonicotinohydrazide and N 1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethane-1,2-diamine) and characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, IR mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

Efforts to control and prevent zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission, or spillover. However, in the modern era, increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the spread of infected humans, non-human animals (hereafter animals), and their products worldwide, thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic areas. Imported zoonoses can potentially spill back to infect local wildlifea danger magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between human and wildlife populations. In this way, humans can function as vectors, dispersing zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel animal host populations. Once established, these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics. Understanding when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling ecologically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis, the human population, and the natural ecosystem. We address this challenge by delineating potential ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishmentwildlife exposure, enzootic infection, and persistenceapplying existing ecological concepts from epidemiology, invasion biology, and population ecology. We ground our study in the neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic originyellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruseshave separately been introduced into the human population.

No available data exist so far regarding the safety, efficacy, and toxicology of these vaccines when administered during pregnancy. Most of the Obstetrics and Gynecology societies suggested that pregnant could agree to be vaccinated, after a thorough counseling of risks and benefits with their gynecologists, thus leading to an autonomous decision. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the attitude to coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women in Italy. STUDY DESIGN: A survey was made at the University of Naples Federico II and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome, on pregnant and breastfeeding women asking their perspectives on the available vaccines after reading the recommendations issued by our national Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Neonatology societies. The questionnaire included 12 items finalized to evaluate general features of the women and 6 items specifically correlated to their attitudes toward the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare group differences of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Naples Federico II (ref. no. 409/2020) and the Ospedale Cristo Re, Tor Vergata University of Rome (ref. #Ost4-2020). RESULTS: Most of the included women did not agree to eventually receive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine during pregnancy (40 [28.2%] vs 102 [71.8%]). Being pregnant was considered a determinant factor to refuse the vaccine prophylaxis (99 [69.7%] vs 43 [30.3%]; chi-square test=24.187; P<.001), even if a very large percentage declared to be generally in favor of vaccines (128 [90.1%] vs 14 [9.9%]; chi-square test=6.091; P=.014) and most of them confirmed they received or would receive other recommended vaccines during pregnancy (75 [52.8%] vs 67 [47.2%]; chi-square test=10.996; P=.001).

Since no successful treatment and vaccine have been reported, efforts to improve the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices are critical to reducing the spread of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the general public knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in three developing countries (China, India, and Pakistan). The reason for choosing only three countries is to identify the cross-border effect statistically and data collection constraints. The IBM SPSS version 23.0 was used for descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analysis of the study. One thousand one hundred and sixty participants completed the study, one-quarter of them were female, and three-quarters were male. The study's findings evidenced that the knowledge and attitude correlation was 58.4% and between knowledge and practices 18.2%. Furthermore, the knowledge was found lower in females, among India and Pakistan, and people aged less and equivalent to 30 years. The attitudes among respondents were found poorer among unmarried females and India and Pakistan residents. While the practices found lower among employed, unemployed and, respondents had a bachelor's degree, and females reside in India.

Besides, we all learned very well that the disposable biochips, to be used in these in vitro diagnostic (IVD) testing systems, supposed to be produced in large amounts in a very short time to be widely available for the use of humanity to save more and more lives. That is why; roll-to-roll (R2R) polymer structuring manners offer such large quantities for the production of in vitro biochips. Our technology, based on R2R UV nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL), has superior features. Via our pilot line, robust 7500 biochip components per 100 meter of a flexible, polymer foil coated with a UV curable photo-resin (i.e., parts with capillary fluidic channels or optical structures for IVDs) can be generated. This study shows an example of a prototype of a R2R UV-NIL generated chip: a foil, capillary flow-based IVD biochip for multiplexed DNA detection purposes (i.e., a Lab-on-a-Foil device). The biochip performance was further increased dramatically by integrating UV-NIL produced retro-reflective microstructures, which reflects the light back, to its design to enhance optical signal detection in a commercial IVD device, detecting DNA on a chemiluminescent-reaction basis.

Do individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest or during exercise? What is the main finding and its importance? Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have a greater prevalence of blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest than age-matched control subjects. Given that the intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses are large enough to permit venous emboli to pass into the arterial circulation, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and an elevated risk of thrombus formation may be at risk of intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomosis-facilitated embolic injury (e.g. stroke or transient ischaemic attack). The pulmonary capillaries prevent stroke by filtering venous emboli from the circulation. Intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses are large-diameter (50 m) vascular connections in the lung that may compromise the integrity of the pulmonary capillary filter and have recently been linked to cryptogenic stroke and transient ischaemic attack. Prothrombotic populations, such as individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may be at increased risk of stroke and transient ischaemic attack facilitated by intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses, but the prevalence and degree of blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses in this population has not been fully examined and compared with age-matched healthy control subjects. We used saline contrast echocardiography to assess blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest (n = 29 COPD and 19 control subjects) and during exercise (n = 10 COPD and 10 control subjects) in subjects with COPD and age-matched healthy control subjects. Blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses was detected in 23% of subjects with COPD at rest and was significantly higher compared with age-matched healthy control subjects. Blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest was reduced or eliminated in subjects with COPD after breathing hyperoxic gas. Sixty per cent of subjects with COPD who did not have blood flow through the intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses at rest had blood flow through them during exercise. The combination of blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses and potential for thrombus formation in individuals with COPD may permit venous emboli to pass into the arterial circulation and cause stroke and transient ischaemic attack. Breathing supplemental oxygen may reduce this risk in COPD. The link between blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses, stroke and transient ischaemic attack is worthy of future investigation in COPD and other populations.","output":"Intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses in humans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: implications for cryptogenic stroke?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been considered one of the recent epidemics that occurred at the last of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 that world widespread. This spread of COVID-19 requires a fast technique for diagnosis to make the appropriate decision for the treatment. X-ray images are one of the most classifiable images that are used widely in diagnosing patients' data depending on radiographs due to their structures and tissues that could be classified. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is the most accurate classification technique used to diagnose COVID-19 because of the ability to use a different number of convolutional layers and its high classification accuracy. Classification using CNNs techniques requires a large number of images to learn and obtain satisfactory results. In this paper, we used SqueezNet with a modified output layer to classify X-ray images into three groups: COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. In this study, we propose a deep learning method with enhance the features of X-ray images collected from Kaggle, Figshare to distinguish between COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia infection. In this regard, several techniques were used on the selected image samples which are Unsharp filter, Histogram equal, and Complement image to produce another view of the dataset. The Squeeze Net CNN model has been tested in two scenarios using the 13,437 X-ray images that include 4479 for each type (COVID-19, Normal and Pneumonia). In the first scenario, the model has been tested without any enhancement on the datasets. It achieved an accuracy of 91%. But, in the second scenario, the model was tested using the same previous images after being improved by several techniques and the performance was high at approximately 95%. The conclusion of this study is the used model gives higher accuracy results for enhanced images compared with the accuracy results for the original images.

RESULTS: We analyzed serum samples from 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 61 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 positive and control patients did not differ in baseline patients characteristics, symptoms and clinical presentation. Mean serum concentrations of ACE2, angiotensin II, and aldosterone did not differ between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the control group. In line with this, serum potassium as surrogate parameter for RAAS activity and blood pressure were similar in both groups.

The objective of this training tool was to improve the preparedness of health care workers and the control measures to manage any respiratory infection outbreaks. Also, to provide good patient care and patient safety during the sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing pandemic respiratory infection outbreak worldwide. Methods: Simulated patient environment is a kind of functional mock drill that was applied to assess and improve the readiness of the healthcare workers of the hospital to identify the patient at the screening area, guide the patient for investigation and inform the public health system during an outbreak of an infection. The faculty of the Department of Microbiology, Community and Family Medicine, and General Medicine were the educators and demonstrators. Fifty healthcare workers from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Mangalagiri, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India, such as doctors, epidemiologists, nurses, laboratory technicians, laboratory attendants, members of infection control team and biomedical waste management team participated in this program. Results: Statistical analysis of the results with pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments and feedback from the participants was done at the end of the program.

METHODS: FOCUS4 was a Phase II/III molecularly stratified umbrella trial testing the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer. It used adaptive statistical methodology to decide which sub-trial should close early, and new therapies were added as protocol amendments. Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer were registered, and central laboratory testing was used to stratify their tumour into molecular subtypes. Following 16 weeks of first-line therapy, patients with stable or responding disease were eligible for randomisation into either a molecularly stratified sub-trial (FOCUS4-B, C or D) or non-stratified FOCUS4-N. The primary outcome for all studies was progression-free survival comparing the intervention with active monitoring/placebo. At the close of the trial, feedback was elicited from all investigators through surveys and interviews and consolidated into a series of recommendations and lessons learned for the delivery of similar future trials. RESULTS: Between January 2014 and October 2020, 1434 patients were registered from 88 UK hospitals. Of the 20 drug combinations that were explored for inclusion in the platform trial, three molecularly targeted sub-trials were activated: FOCUS4-D (February 2014CMarch 2016) evaluated AZD8931 in the BRAF-PIK3CA-RAS wildtype subgroup; FOCUS4-B (February 2016CJuly 2018) evaluated aspirin in the PIK3CA mutant subgroup and FOCUS4-C (June 2017COctober 2020) evaluated adavosertib in the RAS+TP53 double mutant subgroup.

While the adopted mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful, policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the mitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to recover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak. Classically, exit strategies rely on mathematical modeling to predict the effect of public health interventions.

We have therefore built a pandemic simulation and forecasting toolkit that combines a deep learning estimation of the epidemiological parameters of the disease in order to predict the cases and deaths, and a genetic algorithm component searching for optimal trade-offs/policies between constraints and objectives set by decision-makers. Replaying pandemic evolution in various countries, we experimentally show that our approach yields predictions with much lower error rates than pure epidemiological models in 75% of the cases and achieves a 95% R2 score when the learning is transferred and tested on unseen countries.

India has reported surge in cases of COVID 19 associated Mucormycosis over the past few months due to the increasing frequency of risk factors like corticosteroid therapy, uncontrolled diabetes, neutropenia and obesity. Studies have shown that eukaryote cell membrane contains cholesterol and fungal cell wall contains ergosterol with lanosterol being precursor for both and ergosterol is essential for mitochondrial DNA maintenance in fungi, as cholesterol is in humans. The current study is based on the hypothesis that fungi can use human cholesterol as a raw material to maintain its cell function and accentuate its own multiplication and this can indirectly be shown by the association between deranged lipid parameters in an individual with severity of Mucormycosis. Thus present study aims to estimate the lipid parameters and correlate the serum lipid parameters with clinical profile, stage of the disease and duration of onset of mucormycosis in patients with COVID associated Mucormycosis. MATERIAL: This is a cross sectional study conducted on 103 patients diagnosed with COVID 19 associated mucormycosis admitted to the hospitals attached to BMCRI from July 2021 to September 2021. Serum fasting lipid profile and other biochemical parameters were determined. The correlation of lipid levels with clinical profile, onset and staging of mucormycosis patients were obtained. OBSERVATION: The age distribution varied from 22yrs to 75yrs of whom majority were males (83.4%). Among patients with mucormycosis of all severity stages, nasal block (79.6%) was found to be most common symptom followed by headache(75.7%). Among patients with mucormycosis most frequent associated comorbidity was Diabetes mellitus (DM) followed by hypertension (HTN) followed by DM and HTN followed by Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) followed by DM,HTN and IHD. The study showed statistically significant correlation such that severity of mucormycosis increased with progressive worsening lipid parameters. It also showed statistically significant correlation such that patients with increasing TC,LDL,VLDL,TG levels had shorter COVID 19 onset to mucormycosis onset duration. CONCLUSION: The study showed a positive correlation between serum lipid profile and staging of mucormycosis and negative correlation between lipid levels with duration between onset of COVID 19 to onset of mucormycosis.

The results of this study show that ACE2 has strikingly low expression in healthy human lung tissue and was absent from the list of differentially expressed genes. However, when transcription factors were analyzed, we found a significant upregulation of FOS and downregulation of FOXO4 and FOXP2. Moreover, the miRNA prediction analysis revealed that miR-1246, whose upregulation has been experimentally established to be a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), was found to be targeting the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of ACE2. This study presents a wide range of potentially important transcription factors as well as miRNA targets associated with ACE2 which can be potentially used for drug designing amid this challenging pandemic situation.

We assessed the predictive accuracy of sCys C for COVID-19 severity by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The participants were divided into two groups based on the sCys C cut-off value. We evaluated the association between high sCys C level and the development of severe COVID-19 disease, using a COX proportional hazards regression model. The area under the ROC curve was 0.708 (95% CI 0.594C0.822), the cut-off value was 1.245 (mg/L), and the sensitivity and specificity was 79.1% and 60.7%, respectively. A multivariable Cox analysis showed that a higher level of sCys C (adjusted HR 2.78 95% CI 1.25C6.18, p = 0.012) was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing a severe COVID-19 illness.

These same warnings are reverberating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of the impacts of EVD on maternal and child health services from facility data can be instructive during COVID-19. We surveyed all peripheral healthcare units (PHUs) in Sierra Leone in October 2014 and March 2015 to assess closures, staffing, amenities, medicines, supplies, and service utilization during May 2014-January 2015 and October 2013-January 2014. We report PHU characteristics and service utilization changes for equivalent 4-month periods during the epidemic and the prior year. We present utilization changes by district and service type, and model excess child mortality. PHU closures (-8%) and staff attrition (-3%) were limited, but many facilities lacked amenities, medicines, and supplies. Utilization of preventive and scheduled services fell more than individualized, clinical care interventions, aside from malaria treatment which declined significantly. Ebola virus disease intensity in districts was weakly associated with utilization, aside from two districts that were severely affected. Modeling suggests utilization declines resulted in 6,782 excess under-five deaths (an increase of 21%) between 2014 and 2015. Ebola virus disease negatively affected service provision, but utilization declined relatively more, particularly for preventive and scheduled interventions. Although these findings are specific to Sierra Leone's EVD epidemic, they illustrate the magnitude of possible effects in other settings due to COVID-19-induced service disruptions, where collateral impacts on child mortality from other preventable causes may far outweigh COVID-19 mortality.","output":"The Effect of Ebola Virus Disease on Maternal and Child Health Services and Child Mortality in Sierra Leone, 2014-2015: Implications for COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The significant health and economic effects of COVID-19 emphasize the requirement for reliable forecasting models to avoid the sudden collapse of healthcare facilities with overloaded hospitals. Several forecasting models have been developed based on the data acquired within the early stages of the virus spread. However, with the recent emergence of new virus variants, it is unclear how the new strains could influence the efficiency of forecasting using models adopted using earlier data. In this study, we analyzed daily positive cases (DPC) data using a machine learning model to understand the effect of new viral variants on morbidity rates. A deep learning model that considers several environmental and mobility factors was used to forecast DPC in six districts of Japan. From machine learning predictions with training data since the early days of COVID-19, high-quality estimation has been achieved for data obtained earlier than March 2021. However, a significant upsurge was observed in some districts after the discovery of the new COVID-19 variant B.1.1.7 (Alpha). An average increase of 20C40% in DPC was observed after the emergence of the Alpha variant and an increase of up to 20% has been recognized in the effective reproduction number. Approximately four weeks was needed for the machine learning model to adjust the forecasting error caused by the new variants. The comparison between machine-learning predictions and reported values demonstrated that the emergence of new virus variants should be considered within COVID-19 forecasting models.

For breast cancer, the program invites women aged 50-74 years for biennial screening mammography. From mid-June 2020 (week 25) the breast cancer screening program was resumed, albeit with reduced capacity (max 60%). We aimed to investigate the impact of resuming the screening program on incidence, tumor-, and T-stage of screen- and non-screen-detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer (IBC) in the Netherlands. Methods: Women, 50-74 years of age, diagnosed with DCIS or IBC in weeks 2-35 of 2018, 2019 and 2020 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Weekly incidence of screen- and non-screen-detected tumors was calculated and expressed per 1 million women aged 50-74 years living in the Netherlands. Weeks 2-35 were divided in seven periods, representing separate phases of the pandemic. For each period, incidence of screen- and non-screen-detected tumors was stratified by clinical tumor stage (TNM) and clinical T-stage. Incidence in each period of 2020 was compared with the incidence in the same period of 2018/2019 (averaged). Results: In weeks 2-35, 7,250 patients were diagnosed in 2018, 7,299 in 2019, and 5,300 in 2020. During weeks 2-12 2020 the weekly average incidence of screen-detected tumors was 42/1 million women aged 50-74. In week 13 incidence dropped to 19, and was almost zero during weeks 14-25. Incidence increased to 4 in week 26, when the screening was gradually restarted, and increased to an weekly average of 24 tumors/1 million in weeks 30-35, when screening had restarted in most of the Netherlands. During weeks 14-16, 17-25, 26-29, and 30-35 2020 incidence of screen detected DCIS, stage I-II tumors and T0-2 tumors was lower than in the same period of 2018/2019. Distribution of tumor- and T-stage in newly diagnosed tumors did not differ between the periods (24% DCIS, 57% stage I, 18% stage II, 1% stage III, 1% stage IV;24% T0, 59% T1, 15% T2, 2% T3, 0% T4). During weeks 2-11 2020 the weekly average incidence of non-screen-detected tumors was 38/1 million women aged 50-74. Incidence dropped to 16 in week 14, and increased to an average of 37 tumors per week in weeks 17-35. During weeks 17-25, 26-29, and 30-35 the incidence and distribution of non-screen-detected DCIS, stage I-IV and T0-4 tumors was comparable with 2018/2019 (weekly incidence (distribution): 3 DCIS (9%), 15 stage I (40%), 13 stage II (36%), 3 stage III (7%), 3 stage IV (8%);3 T0 (9%), 17 T1 (45%), 12 T2 (34%), 3 T3 (8%), 2 T4 (5%)). Conclusion: The temporary suspension of the breast cancer screening program reduced the incidence of breast cancer. After resuming screening the incidence did not raise above the incidence in 2018/2019, therefore it is expected that the incidence will rise during the next months. The results to date did not show a shift towards a higher tumor stage or T-stage.","output":"The impact of resuming the breast cancer screening program in the Netherlands on breast cancer incidence and stage after its discontinuation due to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standardized screening assessments and sex differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are still under-explored in Poland.

METHODS: This prospective cohort study analyzes five waves of Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data, Wave 1 (2013-2014) through Wave 5 (2018-2019). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence was captured over three intervals (Waves 1 to 3, Waves 2 to 4, and Waves 3 to 5). Participants were adults (40+ years old) without a history of CVD for the first two waves of any interval. Change in tobacco use status, from exclusive past 30 day use of any combustible-tobacco product to either exclusive past 30 day ENDS use, dual past 30 day use of ENDS and combustible-tobacco, or no past 30 day use of any tobacco, between the first two waves of an interval was used to predict onset of CVD between the second and third waves in the interval. CVD incidence was defined as a new self-report of being told by a health professional that they had congestive heart failure, stroke, or a myocardial infarction. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses combined 10,548 observations across intervals from 7820 eligible respondents. RESULTS: Overall, there were 191 observations of CVD among 10,548 total observations (1.7%, standard error (SE) = 0.2), with 40 among 3014 never users of tobacco (1.5%, SE = 0.3). In multivariable models, CVD incidence was not significantly different for any tobacco user groups compared to never users. There were 126 observations of CVD among 6263 continuing exclusive combustible-tobacco users (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-2.39), 15 observations of CVD among 565 who transitioned to dual use (AOR = 1.85; 0.78-4.37), and 10 observations of CVD among 654 who quit using tobacco (AOR = 1.18; 0.33-4.26).

Stroke is a major neurological disease contributing to death and disability worldwide, and is still an ongoing issue during the pandemic. Here we investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on stroke manifestations, treatment courses, the outcome of stroke patients, and the hospitalization rate in a referral center for stroke management in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 31 stroke patients (10 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019) and compared the demographic and pathological characteristics of the patients with or without coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The association of demographic/pathological characteristics of stroke patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and a corresponding period during the previous year (49 patients) and an earlier period during the same year as the pandemic (50 patients) was also evaluated. RESULTS: The absolute number of admissions decreased about 40% during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Except for the stroke severity (P = 0.002), there were no significant changes in the demographic and pathological characteristics of the stroke patients during the three studied periods. A significantly higher mean of age (75.60  9.54 versus 60.86  18.45; P = 0.007), a significant difference in the type of stroke (P = 0.046), and significantly higher stroke severity (P = 0.024) were observed in stroke patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with those of stroke patients without coronavirus disease 2019. Treatment approaches, duration of hospitalization, and mortality rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the pandemic caused the number of acute stroke admissions to plummet compared to other periods. Although the pandemic did not affect the treatment plans and care of the patients, stroke cases with coronavirus disease 2019 had higher age, more large vessel ischemic stroke, and more severe stroke.

Due to rebreathing of CO(2) as compared to fresh gas, pendelluft might reduce ventilatory efficiency possibly exacerbating patients respiratory workload during weaning. Our aim was to measure pendelluft by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in patients who failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: This is an observational study conducted in a general intensive care unit of a tertiary-level teaching hospital. EIT signal was recorded in 20 patients while pressure support (PS) ventilation was progressively reduced from clinical level (baseline) to 2 cmH(2)O, as in an SBT; four ventral-to-dorsal lung regions of interest were identified for pendelluft measurement. A regional gas movement (> 6 mL) occurring in a direction opposite to the global EIT signal was considered diagnostic for high pendelluft. RESULTS: Eight patients out of 20 (40%) were classified as high-pendelluft; baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between high- and low-pendelluft patients. At PS reduction, pendelluft and EtCO(2) increased more in the high-pendelluft group (p < .001 and .011, respectively). The volume of gas subject to pendelluft moved almost completely from the ventral towards the dorsal lung regions, while the opposite movement was minimal (16.3 [10:32.8] vs. 0 [0:1.8] mL, p = .001). In a subgroup of patients, increased pendelluft volumes positively correlated with markers of respiratory distress such as increased respiratory rate, p0.1, and EtCO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Occult pendelluft can be measured by EIT, and is frequently present in patients failing an SBT. When present, pendelluft increases with the reduction of ventilator support and is associated with increased EtCO(2), suggesting a reduction of the ability to eliminate CO(2).","output":"Occurrence of pendelluft under pressure support ventilation in patients who failed a spontaneous breathing trial: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the exceptional situation that has been experienced on a global scale since 2020, it is essential to assess the impact of COVID-19 in several areas and domains. Therefore, this research seeks to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on work-related quality of life (WRQoL) in a Portuguese-speaking sample, through the lens of sexual orientation. One thousand, five hundred and seventy-seven individuals participated in this study, of which 1396 (88.5%) self-identified as heterosexual, 95 (6.0%) as gay or lesbian, and 87 (5.5%) as bisexual. Participants responded to the Work-Related Quality of Life scale, the Fear of COVID-19 scale, and the Negative Impact of COVID-19 scale. Bisexuals scored higher on Fear of COVID-19 and Negative Impact of COVID-19 than heterosexual, and gay, or lesbian participants. Differences between sexual orientations for all dimensions of WRQoL were found: heterosexual participants scored higher on general well-being, homeCwork interface, career satisfaction, working conditions, and lower on stress at work, compared to bisexual, and gay, or lesbian participants. Gay or lesbian participants scored lower than heterosexual and bisexual participants on career satisfaction and working conditions. Sexual orientation, the fear of COVID-19, and the negative impact of COVID-19 were significant predictors of overall WRQoL (explaining 13% of variance). Moderation analysis also showed that sexual orientation is a significant moderator of the association between the fear of COVID-19, the negative impact of COVID-19, and WRQoL. LGB people (especially bisexuals) suffer more severe impacts of COVID-19 and have lower WRQoL than heterosexual people. Inevitably, this has consequences in terms of mental health and overall quality of life for sexual minorities, thus reinforcing the need to adopt inclusive policies in organizations and companies to improve their WRQoL.","output":"Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on Work-Related Quality of Life through the Lens of Sexual Orientation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic is having considerable impact on cancer care, including restricted access to hospital-based care, treatment and psychosocial support. We investigated the impact on unmet needs and psychosocial well-being.

Forty-one participants recruited pre-pandemic were compared with 103 participants recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured participants' unmet supportive care needs, psychological distress and quality of life. RESULTS: Half of our patient respondents reported unexpected changes to treatment following pandemic onset, with widespread confusion about their longer-term consequences. Although overall need levels have not increased, specific needs have changed in prominence. People with cancer reported significantly reduced anxiety (p = 0.049) and improved quality of life (p = 0.032) following pandemic onset, but support network participants reported reduced quality of life (p = 0.009), and non-significantly elevated anxiety, stress and depression.

A post-vaccination cross-sectional survey was conducted to obtain data on attitudes towards and safety of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines in SLE patients compared to healthy controls. A post-vaccination cross-sectional survey was conducted in 188 patients with SLE and in 190 healthy controls who had received at least one dose of SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine to find out post-vaccination adverse event (AE) or SLE flares. A total of 188 patients with SLE and 190 healthy controls vaccinated with the two-dose regimen SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine were enrolled in the study. The two groups were matched in age, sex, medical background, income, and education level. All the SLE patients were in disease remission or with low disease activity with a median age of 35 years, a sex constituent ratio of 87.4% female, and a median disease duration of 4 years. SLE patients had much more concerns about vaccination safety (44.7% vs. 15.8%, P < 0.001), and were much less willing to get vaccinated (57.4% vs. 88.4%, P < 0.001). SLE patients had more mild adverse events after the first vaccine dose (43.6% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.008), and less mild adverse events after the second vaccine dose (19.8% vs. 34.9%, P = 0.024), compared with healthy controls. The AEs were minor and there were no serious or major adverse events in both groups. In patients with SLE, the post-vaccination disease activity remained stable. One previously undiagnosed female progressed into symptomatic SLE after one week of vaccination. Although SLE patients had concerns about the safety of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the inactivated vaccination was safe in patients with stable SLE.

Therefore, it is important to establish the correlates of loneliness. The purpose of the current study was to explore how loneliness relates to a construct termed mattering, which is the feeling of being important to other people. Mattering was assessed with multiple measures in the current study (e.g., mattering in general, fears of not mattering, and mattering to peers). A sample of 172 female psychology undergraduate students aged 18C25 years completed self-report measures of general mattering, mattering to peers, anti-mattering, fear of not mattering, and state and trait loneliness. As predicted, lower levels of both general mattering and mattering to peers were associated with higher state loneliness. Higher feelings of anti-mattering (feelings of being invisible and insignificant to others) and fears of not mattering were associated with greater trait loneliness, as well as a reduced sense of mattering to friends. The findings illustrate that feeling as though one does not matter to others (i.e., feeling insignificant and unimportant) is associated with increased state and trait loneliness among young women.

Methods: We measured markers of neuronal injury (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], neurofilament light chain [NfL]) and soluble markers of inflammation among a cohort of people with prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at early and late recovery following the initial illness (defined as less than and greater than 90 days, respectively). The primary clinical outcome was the presence of self-reported central nervous system (CNS) PASC symptoms during the late recovery timepoint. We compared fold-changes in marker values between those with and without CNS PASC symptoms using linear mixed effects models and examined relationships between neurologic and immunologic markers using rank linear correlations. Results: Of 121 individuals, 52 reported CNS PASC symptoms. During early recovery, those who went on to report CNS PASC symptoms had elevations in GFAP (1.3-fold higher mean ratio, 95% CI 1.04-1.63, p=0.02), but not NfL (1.06-fold higher mean ratio, 95% CI 0.89-1.26, p=0.54). During late recovery, neither GFAP nor NfL levels were elevated among those with CNS PASC symptoms. Although absolute levels of NfL did not differ, those who reported CNS PASC symptoms demonstrated a stronger downward trend over time in comparison to those who did not report CNS PASC symptoms (p=0.041). Those who went on to report CNS PASC also exhibited elevations in IL-6 (48% higher during early recovery and 38% higher during late recovery), MCP-1 (19% higher during early recovery), and TNF-alpha (19% higher during early recovery and 13% higher during late recovery). GFAP and NfL correlated with levels of several immune activation markers during early recovery; these correlations were attenuated during late recovery. Conclusions: Self-reported neurologic symptoms present >90 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with elevations in markers of neurologic injury and inflammation at early recovery timepoints, suggesting that early injury can result in long-term disease. The correlation of GFAP and NfL with markers of systemic immune activation suggests one possible mechanism that might contribute to these symptoms.

Disease progression is driven by the formation and deposition of immune complexes composed of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) and Gd-IgA1 autoantibodies (anti-Gd-IgA1 antibodies) in the glomeruli, where they trigger complement-mediated inflammation that can result in loss of kidney function and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). With the risk of progression and limited treatment options, there is an unmet need for therapies that address the formation of pathogenic Gd-IgA1 antibody and anti-Gd-IgA1 antibody-containing immune complexes. New therapeutic approaches target immunological aspects of IgAN, including complement-mediated inflammation and pathogenic antibody production by inhibiting activation or promoting depletion of B cells and CD38-positive plasma cells. This article will review therapies, both approved and in development, that support the depletion of Gd-IgA1-producing cells in IgAN and have the potential to modify the course of this disease.

The antiviral properties of naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was previously demonstrated to be active against Influenza A virus, were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence anisotropy, and dynamic light scattering assays demonstrated naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARS-Cov-2 as predicted by molecular modeling. Naproxen impeded recombinant N oligomerization and inhibited viral replication in infected cells. In VeroE6 cells and reconstituted human primary respiratory epithelium models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, naproxen specifically inhibited viral replication and protected the bronchial epithelia against SARS-CoV-2-induced damage. No inhibition of viral replication was observed with paracetamol or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Thus, among the NSAID tested, only naproxen combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of pediatric retransplantation from living donor at a single center. METHODS: Between December 1998 to August 2015, retransplantation from a living donor was performed for 14 children (<18 years of age) at Kumamoto University Hospital. The characteristics of the retransplantation recipient and the clinicopathological factors between primary transplantation and retransplantation were analyzed to detect the prognostic factors. RESULTS: In retransplantation, the operative time was longer and the amount of blood loss was greater in comparison to primary transplantation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates from the date of retransplantation were 85.7, 85.7, and 78.6%, respectively. The rates of re-laparotomy after primary transplantation, bile leakage and postoperative bleeding after retransplantation were higher than after primary transplantation. Among the three patients who died after retransplantation, the operative time, the rate of re-laparotomy after primary transplantation and the incidence of gastrointestinal complications were higher in comparison to the surviving patients. CONCLUSION: Pediatric retransplantation from a living donor is an acceptable procedure that could save the lives of recipients with failing allografts when organs from deceased donors are scarce.

We evaluated the impact of ARTS in the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke (NASA) registry. Summary Data on the use of the aspiration technique were available for 285 anterior circulation patients, of which 29 underwent ARTS technique, 131 CGC, and 125 BGC. Baseline demographics were comparable, except that ARTS patients are less likely to have hypertension or atrial fibrillation. The ARTS group had more ICA occlusions (41.4 vs. 22% in the BGC, p = 0.04 and 26% in CGC, p = 0.1) and less MCA/M1 occlusions (44.8 vs. 68% in BGC and 62% in CGC). Time from arterial puncture to reperfusion or end of procedure with ARTS was shorter than with CGC (54 vs. 91 min, p = 0.001) and was comparable to the BGC time (54 vs. 67, p = 0.11).

However, the underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 altering human immune response is still elusive. The existing literature on miRNA mediated pathogenesis of RNA virus viz. Dengue virus, West Nile virus, etc. raises a suspicion that miRNA encoded by SARS-CoV-2 might facilitate virus replication and regulate the host's gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. METHODS We investigated this possibility via computational prediction of putative miRNAs encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome using a novel systematic pipeline that predicts putative mature-miRNA and their targeted genes transcripts. To trace down if viral-miRNAs targeted the genes critical to the immune pathway, we assessed whether mature miRNA transcripts exhibit effective hybridization with the 3'UTR region of human gene transcripts. Conversely, we also tried to study human miRNA-mediated viral gene regulation to get insight into the miRNA mediated offense and defense mechanism of viruses and their host organisms in too. RESULTS Our analysis led us to shortlist six putative miRNAs that target, majorly, genes related to cell proliferation/differentiation/signaling, and senescence. Nonetheless, they also target immune-related genes that directly/indirectly orchestrate immune pathways like TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways putatively serving as the nucleus to cytokine storms. CONCLUSION Besides, these six miRNAs were found to conserved so far across 80 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (NCBI Virus, last assessed 12 April 2020) including Indian strains that are also targeted by 7 human miRNAs and can, therefore, be exploited to develop MicroRNA-Attenuated Vaccines.","output":"miRNAs in SARS-CoV 2: A Spoke in the Wheel of Pathogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing and manufacturing effective vaccines against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been epic achievements in record time.

The outcomes currently measured and reported in randomised controlled trials of early childhood obesity prevention interventions to reduce this burden of obesity are heterogeneous, and measured in a variety of ways. This variability limits the comparability of findings between studies, and contributes to research waste. This protocol presents the methodology for the development of two core outcome sets (COS) for obesity prevention interventions in children aged from 1 to 5 years from a singular development process: (1) a COS for interventions targeting physical activity and sedentary behaviour and (2) a COS for interventions targeting child feeding and dietary intake. Core outcomes related to physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children aged 1 year will also be identified to complement an existing COS for early feeding interventions, and provide a broader set of core outcomes in this age range. This will result in a suite of COS useful for measuring and reporting outcomes in early childhood obesity prevention studies, including multicomponent interventions.

An investigator-developed survey was administered to assess nursing staff (n = 66) perceptions regarding the use of rtCGM in the ICU. RESULTS rtCGM data were used to adjust insulin therapy in 30 patients. Discordance between rtCGM and POC glucose values were observed in 11 patients but the differences were not considered clinically significant. Mean sensor glucose decreased from 235.7  42.1 mg/dL (13.1  2.1 mmol/L) to 202.7  37.6 mg/dL (11.1  2.1 mmol/L) with rtCGM management.

Participants were randomly assigned into a mindfulness training (MT) group or a waitlist control (WC) group. Participants in the MT group practiced guided mindfulness meditation for a minimum of 10 min each day for 10 days. Both groups completed questionnaires assessing well-being at baseline and after the 10-day period. We also included four ecological momentary assessments (EMA) interspersed throughout the day to measure fine-grained affective states and recent exposure to COVID-19-related news, which has been linked to negative affect. We observed an increase in positive affect in the MT group compared to the WC group in the post-training assessment. However, no group differences emerged in the other three post-training affective measures of negative affect, anxiety and depression. EMA revealed that the MT group also showed more positive affective valence than the WC group across the 10 days.

The most common presenting features were fever (75.7%), cough (68.8%), and shortness of breath (60%). The median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [interquartile range, 4-12]. The patients needed any kind of mode of oxygen therapy were 82.5%. The most common cause of death was cardiac arrest (70.58%) followed by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (35.29%). Conclusions: In this retrospective study, most patients were young males with the age <60 years. The patients had one or more comorbidities, hypertension being the most common. Inflammatory markers were significantly higher in patients who died in our hospital.","output":"Clinicoepidemiological Features of Covid-19 Patients of Second Wave at a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in Gujarat, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic required a marked re-allocation of healthcare resources, including at Breast Units. A patient-tailored program was developed to assess its efficacy regarding prevention of COVID-19 infection among patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery and healthcare workers (HCWs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 9th to April 9th 2020, 91 patients were selected for elective surgery by means of: i) Pre-hospital screening aimed at avoiding hospitalization of symptomatic or suspicious COVID-19 patients, and ii) prioritisation of surgical procedure according to specific disease features. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (93.4%) were fit for surgery, while five patients (5.5%) were temporarily excluded through 'telephone triage'; another two patients were excluded at in-hospital triage. A total of 71 out of 85 patients (83.5%) were diagnosed with invasive cancer, most of whom were undergoing breast-conserving surgery (61 out of 85 patients, 71.8%). The mean in-hospital stay was 2.2 days (SD=0.7 days). After hospital discharge, no patient needed re-admission due to post-operative complications; moreover, no COVID-19 infection among patients or HCWs was detected. CONCLUSION: Safe breast cancer surgery was accomplished for both patients and HCWs by means of a careful preoperative selection of patients and in-hospital preventative measures. This screening program can be transferred to high-volume Breast Units and it may be useful in implementing European Community recommendations for prevention of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Breast Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Clinical Study of the Breast Surgery Clinic at Ospedale Policlinico San Martino - Genoa, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown measures adopted in Italy to contain the diffusion of Covid-19 altered many variables influencing the anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems. Public reactions included surprise at how quickly changes in human activity seemingly improved natural recovery and, at the same time, a generalised anxiety to restart economic activities. In this situation several Institutions from the Italian National Research Council (CNR) made a joint effort to quantify the effects of the unprecedented experimental conditions induced by the reduction of many anthropogenic pressures. The resulting project was conceived with a holistic, interdisciplinary approach, geared to combine scientific, economic and cultural observations to promote collective actions suitable to the governance of socio-ecological systems, reconciling respect for the environment with human activities and wellbeing, and thus grounding an ethical approach to marine resources. Alongside collecting considerable amount of scientific observations, the project is working to complement samplings and analyses with the non-formal knowledge carried by the inhabitants of a set of coastal zones, thus enriching the generated knowledge and widening inclusion and pluralism in defining the challenges at stake;simultaneously it focuses on stimulating a reflection in the research community over the process of knowledge co-construction, its meaning, role and responsibility in the societal context. After a brief contextualization of this activity, we present here the perspective adopted by researchers to build a responsible marine research plan.

The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that unforeseen fragilities, negatively affecting the supply chain performance, can arise rapidly, and logistics systems may confront unprecedented vulnerabilities regarding network structure disruption and high demand fluctuations. The existing studies on a resilient logistics network design did not sufficiently consider sustainability aspects. In fact, they mainly addressed the independent planning of decision-making problems with economic objectives. To fill this research gap, this paper concentrates on the design of resilient and sustainable logistics networks under epidemic disruption and demand uncertainty. A two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming model is proposed to integrate key decisions of locationCallocation, inventory and routing planning. Moreover, epidemic disruptions and demand uncertainty are incorporated through plausible scenarios using a Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, two resiliency strategies, namely, capacity augmentation and logistics collaboration, are included into the basic model in order to improve the resilience and the sustainability of a logistics chain network. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed approach, evaluate the performance of the different design models and provide managerial insights. The obtained results show that the integration of two design strategies improves resilience and sustainability.","output":"Designing a Resilient and Sustainable Logistics Network under Epidemic Disruptions and Demand Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The semiconductor quantum dot (QD) has been successfully demonstrated as a potentially scalable and on-chip integration technology to generate the triggered photon streams that have many important applications in quantum information science.

Several groups have investigated the course of antibody responses in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infections but little is known about the recovery of cellular immunity. This study investigated the cellular immune response in people who had recovered from SARS-CoV2 infection. Methods 162 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma donors (CCD) and 40 healthy donor (HD) controls were enrolled prospectively in an IRB-approved protocol (Clinical Trials Number: NCT04360278) and provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Using the nCounter platform and host response panel with 785 genes across more than 50 pathways, we compared transcriptomic profiles on RNA samples obtained from the peripheral blood leukocytes of these 162 CCD and 40 HD. Additionally, in 69 of the 162 CCD samples, we evaluated transcriptomic trends at more than one-time point during the convalescent period. Results Age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index distributions were similar among the CCD and HD. With respect to baseline complete blood counts, hemoglobin, platelets, and absolute basophil and eosinophil counts, all were similar among CCD and HD (Table 1). However, despite sample collections occurring several days after convalescence, mean counts for absolute neutrophil counts, absolute monocyte counts, and absolute lymphocyte counts were significantly higher among CCD compared to HD. 30-90 days after diagnosis, 19 of 773 genes differed (FDR < 0.05) between the average CCD and HD samples. Up-regulated genes included MAFB, CTLA4, PTGS2, and the chemokine signaling genes CXCR4, CXCL5, CXCL2 and CCR4. Down-regulated genes included PTGER2, CASP8, and the interleukins IL36A, IL31, IL20 and IL21 (Figure 1 a,b). Differential gene expression persisted for months. At 90-120 days, 13 genes were differentially regulated, including again MAFB CXCR4, PTGS2, CXCL2 and PTGER2, plus SMAD4. At 120-150 days post-diagnosis, 58 genes were differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05) compared to HD. Pathways with up-regulated genes included Treg differentiation, type III interferon signaling and chemokine signaling. 150-360 days post-diagnosis, 4 genes remained up-regulated on average (FDR < 0.05): PTGS2, PIK3CR, CXCL1 and SMAD4 (Figure 1 c,d). Individual patients varied considerably from the mean trend. Scoring samples by their similarity to the gene expression profile of the mean HD sample, 21 CCD samples from 20 unique patients (12%) were identified as highly perturbed from HD. 84% of these highly perturbed samples were collected > 90 days post-diagnosis. Of these 21 samples, 6 were distinguished by > 2-fold up-regulation of a cluster of interleukin and type-1 interferon genes (Figure 2). Conclusions Overall, our study identified important gene expression trends in CCD compared to HD in the post-acute period. The changes varied with time and among donors. As the expression of T-cell inhibitory molecule CTLA4 fell, the number of differentially expressed increased with the most marked changes occurring 120 to 150 days post-diagnosis in genes in chemokine signaling, type III interferon signaling and Treg pathways. Persistent alterations in inflammatory pathways and T-cell activation/exhaustion markers for months after active infection may help shed light on the pathophysiology of a prolonged post-viral syndrome observed in individuals following recovery from COVID-19 infection. Our data may serve as the basis for risk modification strategies in the period of active infection. Future studies may inform the ability to identify druggable targets involving these pathways to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection.

Molecular modeling showed that these substitutions increase the mean binding energy, suggestive of potential adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the mink angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. These substitutions could possibly also impact human ACE2 binding affinity as well as humoral immune responses directed to the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in humans.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was carried out at the University Hospital of Strasbourg (France) from March to April 2020. The analysed population excluded patients from intensive care units but included all other adult patients with COVID-19 who received at least one dose of lopinavir/ritonavir combination, hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin, while inpatients. Analyses were performed by using data extracted from electronic medical records. RESULT: During the study period, 278 patients were included. A rapid decrease in lopinavir/ritonavir prescriptions was observed. This was accompanied by an increase in hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prescriptions until the end of March, followed by a decrease leading to the disappearance of these two medications in April. The pharmaceutical analysis of the prescriptions resulted in 59 PIs of which 21 were associated with lopinavir/ritonavir, 32 with hydroxychloroquine and 6 with azithromycin. Regarding the medication-related problems, the most frequent ones were incorrect treatment durations (n=32 (54.2%)), drug interactions with potential torsadogenic reactions (n=14 (23.7%)) and incorrect dosing (n=6 (10.2%)).

A scale-free network has been adopted for modeling on-line communities so far but is employed here for the aim to represent peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. As a result, three findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the height of the peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection cases tends to get reduced corresponding to the upper bound of the size of groups where all members meet. Second, if we adopt the constraint on m0, the number of all other people one meets separately each at a time, to the range between 2 and 8, its effect on the suppression of infections may be weak as far as we allow group meetings of size W of 8 or larger. Third, such a moderate constraint may temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage but it may turn out to be just a delay of peaks. Based on these results, a policy is proposed here: for quickly suppressing the number of infections, restrict W to less than 4 if the constraint to make m0 at most 1 is too strict. If W is set to less than 4, setting m0 to 4 or less works for quick reduction of infections according to the result.","output":"COVID-19 Should be Suppressed by Mixed Constraints -- from Simulations on Constrained Scale-Free Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study's purpose was to develop an approach to the empirical assessment of the impact of the quality of HC on the developing economy during the economic crisis, using the example of Azerbaijan To obtain quantitative assessments of the qualitative characteristics of human capital development, the questionnaire method has been used Based on a survey of 7232 people (which has been carried out in July-September 2017-2020 in the context of the economic regions of Azerbaijan) and the main components' method, the factors of the qualitative characteristics of the development of the HC were determined An integral model of an empirical assessment of HC's qualitative development has been developed, and the nature and level of its influence on national economies during a pandemic have been determined The findings can be critically useful in developing health and education policies and planning investments for post-crisis recovery","output":"The Impact of Covid-19 on the Quality of Human Capital for the Economic Development of Azerbaijan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is characterized by a high incidence of both recurrent infections and atopic diseases.

DESIGN Case-control study. ANIMALS Cats with sepsis (n = 16) or SIRS (19) and 8 healthy control cats. PROCEDURES Clinical variables were recorded for each cat, and plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-1 activities and IL-6 and CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)-8 concentrations were determined at initial evaluation. RESULTS Clinicopathologic abnormalities associated with sepsis in cats included a high band neutrophil percentage, eosinopenia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. When the sepsis and SIRS groups were compared, the only significant differences in the CBC and plasma biochemical findings were band neutrophil percentage and albumin concentration. Cats with sepsis had significantly greater plasma TNF activity than did healthy cats and were more likely to have detectable concentrations of IL-6 than were cats with SIRS or healthy cats. Plasma IL-1 activity did not differ among groups, and CXCL-8 was not detectable in most (32/43) cats. Mortality rate was not significantly greater for cats with sepsis (7/16) than for cats with SIRS (5/19). Plasma IL-1 activity and IL-6 and chloride concentrations were the only variables correlated with nonsurvival in the sepsis group.

The NHS increased their critical care beds which included expanding the amount of staff. Physiotherapists were a key part of this and were required to complete numerous interventions within the COVID critical care setting throughout the pandemic. Our aim was to collect the incidence and frequency of physiotherapy interventions performed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a critical care setting. METHOD: Data was collected across all critical care beds at the Royal London Hospital for an eight-week period between March- April 2020. We retrospectively collected physiotherapy interventions for example, endotracheal suctioning and functional rehabilitation for every patient in the critical care setting. The Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) scores were also obtained for patients on ACCU admission and discharge. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were included in the sample, 163 COVID-19 positive and 50 COVID-19 negative. Recorded sessions included secretion management (821), weaning (271), rescue therapy (82) and functional rehab (534) across the eight-week period. The mean CPAx score on admission to ACCU for the entire sample was 9/45 points. On discharge that score had improved to 25/45 points.

From March on, those of us blessed enough to shelter without harm sat seized by video after image after report of contemporary lynching. Trauma has a way of disturbing normative notions of time, but I trust my difficulty in distinguishing the last ten years from a past supposedly passed has more to do with the repetition of spectacular displays of antiblackness than with my survival of a murderous inheritance. Watts' remembrance of a time not unlike now, a time composed of the same accumulating weight of Black death, affirms that my difficulty to register a difference between then and now is a con- sequence of a \\"monstrous genre\\" and its twenty-first-century intensification. In his review of Lynching, Eric King Watts warns that the seductive power of Amer- ica's postracial mythos is the belief that leveraging race for progressive purposes results in something Other than more of the same. His contention that postraciality doesn't signal the transcendence or termination of race, but rather its intensification and revision, is one that I share. Projects like The Guardian's \\"The Counted\\" and the Washington Post's \\"Fatal Force,\\" which produce records of antiblack violence similar to those pro- duced by 1930s Black periodicals like the Chicago Defender and Crisis offer one example of this refinement. The assertion of justice by an administration that takes sat- isfaction in cruelties such as family separation and the detention of children, weaponizing COVID-19, prohibiting equity programing and training, and marking the adminis- tration's final days with a killing spree are additional examples of what Watts describes as a refined intensification. His meditation On the dual relation of \\"enjoyment and [racist] terror\\" resonates with Kiese Laymon's warnings about \\"the worst of white folks\\" 2, namely, those who take satisfaction in domination while simultaneously \\"harboring a warped innocence\\" that absolves them of responsibility. We saw this in the case of Chris- tian Cooper, the birdwatcher and Amy Cooper, the woman virally knowing as \\"Central Park Karen.\\" Amy's conscious choice to issue not one but two false reports against Chris- tian in retaliation for his request that she observe the law and curb her dog while in the park, suggests that what would have satisfied her most was to remind Christian Cooper that she, at any moment she pleased, was entitled to his life. Weaponizing white woman- hood for the sheer satisfaction of revenge and for the gratification that racialized terror induces observes Watt's contention that the excess of Black death is steeped in pleasure.","output":"Conspiring Against White Pleasures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While data have shown that Black populations are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, few studies have evaluated birth outcomes in these understudied populations. This study hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection would confer worse maternal and neonatal outcomes in a predominantly Black and underserved population in Brooklyn, New York City. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is associated with higher rates of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, lower APGAR scores, and neonatal resuscitation. Demographic factors and comorbidities were compared between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative groups. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalized patients who gave birth at Kings County Hospital from April 10 through June 10, 2020. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Patients were categorized based on SARS-CoV-2 infection status and peripartum outcomes were analyzed. We used the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. P < 0.05 was considered significant. There were no differences in obstetric or neonatal outcomes between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative cohorts. Most SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were asymptomatic on admission. The rates of maternal comorbidities were similar in the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative groups. In this predominantly Black population in Brooklyn, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not confer increased risk of adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes, despite the prevalence of comorbidities.

Methods The Mariner COVID-19 database was queried for all shoulder, hip, or knee arthroscopies, 2010-2020. Patients with COVID-19 in the 3 months before to 3 months after their surgery were matched by age, gender, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) to patients with an arthroscopy but no perioperative COVID-19 infection, or a COVID-19 infection but no arthroscopic procedure. Medical adverse events (MAEs) in the 3 months after surgery or illness were compared between groups. Results The final cohort consisted of 1,299 matched patients in 3 groups: COVID alone, arthroscopy and perioperative COVID-19, and arthroscopy alone. There were 265 MAEs if a patient had COVID alone (20.4%), 200 MAEs if a patient had arthroscopy with COVID (15.4%), and 71 (5.5%) MAEs if a patient had arthroscopy alone (P<0.01). If a patient had an arthroscopy, having COVID was associated with 3.1-fold elevated odds (95% CI 2.9-3.4, P<0.01) of MAE. Amongst patients with an arthroscopy, MAEs were more common if a patient acquired COVID-19 in the 3 months after their surgery, (pooled OR=7.39, 95% CI 5.49-9.95, P<0.01), but not if a patient had preoperative COVID-19 (pooled OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.42-1.03, P=0.07). Conclusion Having COVID-19 during the postoperative period appears to confer a 7-fold elevated risk of medical adverse events after shoulder, hip, and knee arthroscopy compared to matched patients with arthroscopy and no perioperative COVID, but equivalent to that of patients with COVID and no arthroscopy. However, there was no increase in postoperative medical adverse events if a patient had COVID-19 during the 3 months preceding surgery. Therefore, it appears safe to conduct an arthroscopic procedure shortly after recovery from COVID-19 without an increase in acute medical complication rates.","output":"Postoperative, But not Preoperative COVID-19 is Associated With an Increased Rate of Medical Adverse Events Following Arthroscopic Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lowest mortality in cardiovascular pathology was achieved with the use of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools The actual scenario due to COVID-19, altered the number of people going to medical centers Objective: To evaluate the impact of the change in the number of medical consultations by rotation and the number of hospitalizations in a cardiology center Materials and method: All medical consultations and hospitalizations from January 1, 2020 to April 20, 2020 were analyzed The changes in the number of medical consultations/day and hospitalizations/day in the period before to the implementation of the mandatory quarantine (BQ) (January 1, 2020 to March 19, 2020) versus the quarantine period (QP) (March 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020) were analyzed The results are expressed in percentages Results: There were 1532 medical consultations and 290 hospitalizations evaluated A drop of 55 8% in the number of medical consultations during the QP (37% due to dyspnea, 45% due to chest pain, 72% due to hypertension) was observed There was a 47 2% drop in the number of hospitalizations in the QP (55 6% decompensated heart failure, 44 9% NSTEMI, 26 9% STEMI) Conclusions: The recent pandemic caused by COVID-19 is associated with a significant drop in the rate of consultations by the emergency service and in the number of hospitalizations in the coronary unit, regardless of their etiology, which may significantly impact the morbidity and mortality of patients with cardiovascular pathology","output":"Drastic decrease in the levels of medical consultation at the ER and hospitalization due to cardiovascular pathology in the COVID-19 period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A data base for a large diagnostic virology laboratory is described. The system uses a network of personal computers. It allows the entry, long-term storage, and subsequent retrieval of specimen and patient records (comprising personal identifiers and specimen and result information), and hard-copy results reporting. Sited entirely within the laboratory, the network is not connected to a modem. Within the laboratory there is restricted access to human immunodeficiency virus test results to guarantee patient confidentiality. Retention of a hard-copy of specimen request cards ensures the availability of the original clinical information. The data base is copied on a second file server to facilitate searches, and daily streaming onto magnetic tape provides system protection in the event of hard disc failure. Matching of old and new patient records is done by surname, date of birth, and sex, and therefore duplicate records accumulate when patient names are misspelt on specimen request forms. The system requires further development to speed searches of the data base and to achieve automatic generation of laboratory worksheets. Future goals are the replacement of hard-copy records of clinical information and hard-copy reporting with on-line access to hospital data bases and on-line requesting by and reporting to the clinician.","output":"Computer network for a diagnostic virology laboratory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The lockdown due to COVID-19 may have led to changes in food ordering patterns among youths, which could affect their dietary patterns and the operation of the restaurant industry. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on patterns of take-away food ordering among youth in China. METHODS: The COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS) was conducted among youths at three educational levels (high or vocational school, college, and graduate school) in China in early May 2020. Information on patterns of take-away food ordering in the months immediately before and after the COVID-19 lockdown period (23 January to 8 April 2020) was collected through an online questionnaire survey. RESULTS: A total of 10,082 participants were included in the analysis. Participants ordering food more than once per week dropped from 15.4 to 9.2%, while 81.1% of participants have never ordered food at both time points. Graduate students, although experiencing a decrease in food ordering for more than once per week (from 33.3 to 10.7%), were more likely to order food compared to undergraduate and high school students. A slight increase was observed for ordering fried food or hamburgers and for breakfast and midnight snacks. CONCLUSIONS: The youth have generally ordered take-away food less frequently after COVID-19 lockdown, and the times and types of ordering have both changed. These findings would contribute solid evidence to the current knowledge pool for reference of health promotion communities to keep youths lifestyles healthy and of the restaurant industry to achieve more cost-effective operation in China during future health emergencies.","output":"Changes in patterns of take-away food ordering among youths before and after COVID-19 lockdown in China: the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrocardiogram (ECG) false alarms are common in electrically-hostile peri-operative environments.

Followed by two multi criteria decision-making techniques, i.e. analytic hierarchy process to identify weights of the criteria and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to assess the extent of AI adoption in hiring. Findings The findings reveal that information security and return on investment are considered two very important criteria by human resources managers while contemplating the adoption of AI in hiring process. It was found that AI adoption will be suitable at the sourcing and initial screening stages of hiring. And the suitability of the hiring stage where AI can be applied has been found to have changed from before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic situation. The findings and its discussion assist and enhance better decisions about AI adoption in hiring processes of firms amid changing scenario - external and internal to a firm.

AIM: To assess potential reuse via autoclaving of NRMs worn daily in a major urban Canadian hospital. METHODS: NRM reusability was assessed following collection from volunteer staff after 2C8 h use, sterilization by autoclaving and PortaCount fit testing. A workflow was developed for reprocessing hundreds of NRMs daily. FINDINGS: Used NRMs passed fit testing after autoclaving once, with 86% passing a second reuse/autoclave cycle. A separate cohort of used masks pre-warmed before autoclaving passed fit testing. To recycle 200C1000 NRMs daily, procedures for collection, sterilization and re-distribution were developed to minimize particle aerosolization risk during NRM handling, to reject NRM showing obvious wear, and to promote adoption by staff. NRM recovery ranged from 49% to 80% across 12 collection cycles. CONCLUSION: Reuse of NRMs is feasible in major hospitals and other healthcare facilities. In sharp contrast to studies of unused NRMs passing fit testing after 10 autoclave cycles, we show that daily wear substantially reduces NRM fit, limiting reuse to a single cycle, but still increasing NRM stocks by 66%. Such reuse requires development of a comprehensive plan that includes communication across staffing levels, from front-line workers to hospital administration, to increase the collection, acceptance of and adherence to sterilization processes for NRM recovery.","output":"N95 mask reuse in a major urban hospital: COVID-19 response process and procedure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Examination of the vaccine strategies and technical platforms used for the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of those used for previous emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and pandemics may offer some mutually beneficial lessons.

TDDS are more convenient and less invasive tools for disease and viral infection treatment, prevention, detection, and surveillance. The emerging development of microneedles for TDDS has facilitated improved skin barrier penetration for the delivery of macromolecules or hydrophilic drugs. Microneedle TDDS patches can be fabricated to deliver virus vaccines and potentially provide a viable alternative vaccine modality that offers improved immunogenicity, thermostability, simplicity, safety, and compliance as well as sharp-waste reduction, increased cost-effectiveness, and the capacity for self-administration, which could improve vaccine distribution. These advantages make TDDS-based vaccine delivery an especially well-suited option for treatment of widespread viral infectious diseases including pandemics. Because microneedle-based bioassays employ transdermal extraction of interstitial fluid or blood, they can be used as a minimally invasive approach for surveying disease markers and providing point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. For cutaneous viral infections, TDDS can provide localized treatment with high specificity and less systemic toxicity. In summary, TDDS, especially those that employ microneedles, possess special attributes that can be leveraged to reduce morbidity and mortality from viral infectious diseases. In this regard, they may have considerable positive impact as a modality for improving global health. In this article, we introduce the possible role and summarize the current literature regarding TDDS applications for fighting common cutaneous or systemic viral infectious diseases, including herpes simplex, varicella or herpes zoster, warts, influenza, measles, and COVID-19.","output":"Transdermal drug delivery systems for fighting common viral infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Ivermectin is a widely used antiparasitic drug with known efficacy against several single-strain RNA viruses. Recent data shows significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro by ivermectin concentrations not achievable with safe doses orally. Inhaled therapy has been used with success for other antiparasitics. Methods: An ethanol-based ivermectin formulation was administered once to 14 rats using a nebulizer capable of delivering particles with alveolar deposition. Rats were randomly assigned into three target dosing groups, lower dose (80-90 mg/kg), higher dose (110-140 mg/kg) or ethanol vehicle only. A toxicology profile including behavioral and weight monitoring, full blood count, biochemistry, necropsy and histological examination of the lungs was conducted. The pharmacokinetic profile of ivermectin in plasma and lungs was determined in all animals. Results: There were no relevant changes in behavior or body weight. There was a delayed elevation in muscle enzymes compatible with rhabdomyolysis, that was also seen in the control group and has been attributed to the ethanol dose which was up to 11 grams/kg in some animals. There were no histological anomalies in the lungs of any rat. Male animals received a higher ivermectin dose adjusted by adipose weight and reached higher plasma concentrations than females in the same dosing group (mean C max 86.2 ng/ml vs 26.2 ng/ml in the lower dose group and 152 ng/ml vs 51.8 ng/ml in the higher dose group). All subjects had detectable ivermectin concentrations in the lungs at seven days post intervention, up to 524.3 ng/g for high-dose male and 27.3 ng/g for low-dose females.

Studies demonstrate that an elevated MHC class I-directed CD8(+) cytotoxicity T lymphocyte (CTL) response is able to provide survival benefits to patient with malignant tumor. However, a fully effective cancer therapy must elicit a diverse repertoire of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses, raising demands on a multifaceted activation of the MHC system. Current therapeutic strategies usually lack an orchestrated mobilization of the MHC class I and II responses. Vaccines with little synergistic effect or unmanageable elicitation of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell immunity usually fail to induce a potent and durable anti-tumor protection. Methods: Here, cationic nanoemulsions (CNEs) complexed with full-length tumor model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in the form of mRNA or protein were constructed and used as two antigenic platforms to prepare DCs vaccines with tailored MHC participation (i.e., mRNA-DCs and protein-DCs).

OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to perform a quality analysis of different VAs responses regarding the actual and important subject of COVID-19 vaccines. We focused on this important subject since vaccines are now available and society has urged for the population to be rapidly immunized. METHODS: The proposed study was based on questions that were collected from the of?cial World Health Organization website. These questions were submitted to the 5 dominant VAs (Alexa, Bixby, Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri), and responses were evaluated according to a rubric based on the literature.

We examine how loneliness is associated with PFI, and whether the association is modified by perceived health status. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1201 adults aged  50 years from the Aging, Health, Psychological Well-being and Health Seeking Behavior Study (AgeHeaPsyWelCHeaSeeB) in Ghana. We assessed loneliness using the three-item short-form of the UCLA Loneliness Scale, and PFI was measured with a seven-item scale on mobility-related deficiencies. Adjusted logistic regressions and moderation analysis evaluated the hypothesized associations. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate, severe loneliness, and PFI were 37.5%, 17.7%, and 36.1%, respectively. Regressions showed that loneliness was associated with a 23% increased risk of PFI after adjusting for several potential confounders (OR = 1.23; 95%CI = 1.03C2.81). PFI sub-types revealed similar risks. The loneliness-PFI association was significantly moderated by perceived health status such that a positive health perception attenuated the effect of loneliness on PFI (OR = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.23C0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who were lonely had significantly higher odds for PFI but the effect was tempered by perceived health status.

However, the factors associated with their mental health outcomes are not well understood. AIM: To investigate the psychosocial and demographic characteristics associated with grief distress and depressive symptom severity in bereaved adults with minor children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, web-based survey. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred forty-five bereaved adults raising minor (age <18 years) children who had experienced the death of a co-parent. Primary outcomes were grief distress (Prolonged Grief Disorder-13), depressive symptoms (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Depression), and widowed parenting self-efficacy (WPSES). RESULTS: Mean grief scores were 33.5; mean depression scores were 58.3. Among the 690 individuals more than 6 months bereaved, 132 (19.3%) met criteria for prolonged grief disorder. In adjusted models, participants reporting higher grief scores were more recently bereaved, identified as mothers, non-Caucasian, had lower education and income, and had not anticipated their co-parents death. The statistical modeling results for depression scores were similar to grief scores except that depression was not associated with anticipation of co-parent death. Parents reporting lower WPSES scores had higher grief and depression scores. Retrospective assessments of more intense parenting worries at the time of co-parent death were also associated with higher grief and depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: For bereaved adults with minor children, unanticipated co-parent death was linked with higher grief distress but not symptoms of depression.

Four major GAGs with different substitution patterns, namely hyaluronic acid as unsulphated GAG, heparan-6-sulphate, chondroitin-4-sulphate, and chondroitin-6-sulphate, were investigated to elucidate the influence of sulphation on the dynamical features of GAGs. Moreover, the effects of increasing NaCl and KCl concentrations were studied as well. Different structural parameters were determined from the MD simulations, in combination with a presentation of the free energy landscape of the GAG conformations, which allowed us to unravel the conformational fingerprints unique to each GAG. The largest effects on the GAG structures were found for sulphation at position 6, as well as binding of the metal ions in the absence of chloride ions to the carboxylate and sulphate groups, which both increase the GAG conformational flexibility.","output":"The Influences of Sulphation, Salt Type, and Salt Concentration on the Structural Heterogeneity of Glycosaminoglycans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the contemporary world, new information and communication technologies (ICTs) have revolutionized family relationships and organization.

METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of all pregnant patients with a singleton gestation and a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who delivered at 1 of 33 U.S. hospitals in 14 states from March 1 to July 31, 2020. Disease severity was classified by National Institutes of Health criteria. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes were abstracted by centrally trained and certified perinatal research staff. We evaluated trends in maternal characteristics and outcomes across COVID-19 severity classes and associations between severity and outcomes by multivariable modeling. RESULTS: A total of 1,219 patients were included: 47% asymptomatic, 27% mild, 14% moderate, 8% severe, 4% critical. Overall, 53% were Hispanic; there was no trend in raceCethnicity distribution by disease severity. Those with more severe illness had older mean age, higher median body mass index, and pre-existing medical comorbidities. Four maternal deaths (0.3%) were attributed to COVID-19. Frequency of perinatal death or a positive neonatal SARS-CoV-2 test result did not differ by severity. Adverse perinatal outcomes were more frequent among patients with more severe illness, including 6% (95% CI 2C11%) incidence of venous thromboembolism among those with severeCcritical illness compared with 0.2% in mildCmoderate and 0% in asymptomatic (P<.001 for trend across severity). In adjusted analyses, severeCcritical COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of cesarean birth (59.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.30C1.90), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (40.4% vs 18.8%, aRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18C2.20), and preterm birth (41.8% vs 11.9%, aRR 3.53, 95% CI 2.42C5.14) compared with asymptomatic patients.

The absence of hand hygiene resources in homes put many at risk of these infectious diseases. In the wake of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) and governments around the world have stressed the importance of regular handwashing to prevent the spread of the virus. This suggests that research on water, sanitation, and hygiene issues deserve continuous scholarly attention. In Ghana, studies on household's access to hand hygiene resources are few and relatively old. Therefore, this study estimated the proportion of Ghanaian households with access to hand hygiene resources and their associated determinants using data from a recent national survey. METHODS: The study used the cross-sectional 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys dataset. We used STATA-14 to perform data analyses on a weighted sample of 11,710.06 households. We used complex samples analysis technique to adjust for sample units, stratification and sample weights for both the descriptive statistics and multivariate robust Poisson regression. RESULTS: The result showed that about one fifth of Ghanaian households had access to hand hygiene resources. Households with heads who attained a Middle/JHS/JSS or Secondary/SSS/SHS/Higher level education, those headed by persons having at least 30C44 years, and non-poorest households, and from the Volta region were more likely to have access to hand hygiene resources. Further, households in urban areas, households that spent between 0-30 min to get to a source of water, and households in Eastern and Brong-Ahafo regions were less likely to have access to hand hygiene resources. CONCLUSION: This study identified key socioeconomic and demographic correlates of a household's access to hand hygiene resources in Ghana. In the interim, the government and development partners can provide hand hygiene resources to households with limited or no access. For the long term, we recommend that the government should implement measures and policies that facilitate citizens' economic independence and their attainment of higher formal education.","output":"Correlates of access to hand hygiene resources in Ghanaian households: An exploratory analysis of the 2014 demographic and health survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased usage of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in biomedicine, biosensing, diagnostics and cosmetics has undoubtedly facilitated accidental and unintentional release of AuNPs into specific microenvironments. This is raising serious questions concerning adverse effects of AuNPs on off-target cells, tissues and/or organisms. Applications utilizing AuNPs will typically expose the nanoparticles to biological fluids such as cell serum and/or culture media, resulting in the formation of protein corona (PC) on the AuNPs. Evidence for PC altering the toxicological signatures of AuNPs is well studied in animal systems. In this report, we observed significant genotoxicity in Allium cepa root meristematic cells (an off-target bioindicator) treated with high concentrations (100 g/ml) of green-synthesized vanillin capped gold nanoparticles (VAuNPs). In contrast, protein-coated VAuNPs (PC-VAuNPs) of similar concentrations had negligible genotoxic effects. This could be attributed to the change in physicochemical characteristics due to surface functionalization of proteins on VAuNPs and/or differential bioaccumulation of gold ions in root cells. High elemental gold accumulation was evident from -XRF mapping in VAuNPs-treated roots compared to treatment with PC-VAuNPs. These data infer that the toxicological signatures of AuNPs are influenced by the biological route that they follow to reach off-target organisms such as plants. Hence, the current findings highlight the genotoxic risk associated with AuNPs, which, due to the enhanced utility, are emerging as new pollutants. As conflicting observations on the toxicity of green-synthesized AuNPs are increasingly reported, we recommend that detailed studies are required to investigate the changes in the toxicological signatures of AuNPs, particularly before and after their interaction with biological media and systems.","output":"Reduced Genotoxicity of Gold Nanoparticles With Protein Corona in Allium cepa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pockets of susceptibility resulting from spatial or social heterogeneity in vaccine coverage can drive measles outbreaks, as cases imported into such pockets are likely to cause further transmission and lead to large transmission clusters.

We compared our inferred cluster size distributions to 737 transmission clusters identified through detailed contact-tracing in the United States between 2001 and 2016. We were able to reconstruct the importation status of the cases and found good agreement between the inferred and reference clusters. The results were improved when the contact-tracing investigations were used to set the importation status before running the model.

This preventive measure is an effective source control technique to curb the spread of COVID-19 and other similar diseases. The virus responsible for causing COVID-19 has undergone several mutations in the recent past, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and N501Y, B.1.617, with a higher infectious rate. These viruses' variants are mainly responsible for the recent spike in COVID-19 cases and associated steep rise in mortality rate worldwide. Under these circumstances, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and health experts recommend double masking, which mainly includes a surgical mask and a cotton mask for the general public. This combination provides an additional layer of protection and masks fitment to minimize the leakage of droplets expelled during coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing. This leakage may cause airborne transmission of the virus. In the present study, we report a systematic quantitative unsteady pressure measurement supplement with flow visualization to quantify the effectiveness of a single and double mask. We have also evaluated double masking consisting of a surgical mask and an N-95 mask used by medical professionals. A simple knot improves the surgical mask fitment significantly, and hence, the leakage of droplets is minimized. The leakage of the droplets was reduced to a large extent by using a double mask combination of a two-layer cotton mask over the surgical mask with a knot. The double mask combination of surgical + N-95 and two-layer cotton + N-95 masks showed the most promising results, and no leakage of the droplets is observed in the forward direction. A double mask combination of surgical and N-95 mask offers 8.6% and 5.6% lower mean and peak pressures compared to surgical, and cotton mask. The best results are observed with cotton and N-95 masks with 54.6% and 23% lower mean and peak pressures than surgical and cotton masks; hence, this combination will offer more comfort to the wearer.","output":"Double masking protection vs. comfortA quantitative assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of a complex immune dysregulation syndrome has been established in COVID\\\\19 patients.

The study comprised a 4-week washout phase, a 4-week treatment phase, and a 48-week follow-up. Inclusion criteria included age between 18 and 75 years and diagnosis of mild ED (IIEF-EF score= 17-25) being made at least six months prior to study inclusion and being confirmed by Penile Doppler ultrasonography (US) at baseline examination. Efficacy endpoints were changes from baseline in patient-reported outcomes of erectile function(International Index of Erectile Function domain scores [IIEF-EF]), as well as erection hardness and duration (Sexual Encounter Profile diary [SEP] and Global Assessment Questions [GAQ]). Safety was assessed throughout the study. RESULTS A total of 66 enrolled patients were allocated to ESWT (n=44) or placebo (n=22). Mean age of ESWT and placebo group were 42.32  9.88 and 39.86  11.64 (p=0.374) respectively.

These effectively prevent the spread of infection in advance, but they can lead to a decline in socio-economic activity. Thus, the present study quantified the extent to which isolation and negative test certification respectively reduce the risk of infection. Methods: A discrete-time SEIR model was used as the infectious disease model, and equations for calculating the conditional probability of non-infection status given negative test results on two different days were derived. Results: The respective non-infection probabilities with two negative PCR test results, and with one negative PCR test result and one antigen test result, were quantified. By substituting initial parameters of the SEIR model into these probabilities, the present study revealed the following: (1) isolating close contact individuals can reduce by 80% the risk of infection during the first five days, but five more days are needed to reduce the risk 10% more, and seven more days to reduce the risk 20% more; and (2) if an individual with a negative PCR test result has a negative antigen test result the next day, then his or her infection probability is between 0.6% and 0.7%. Conclusions: Five-day isolation has a proportionally greater effect on risk reduction, compared to longer isolation; and thus, if an isolation period of longer than five days is contemplated, both the risk reduction and the negative effects from such increased isolation should be considered.

Increased TMPRSS2 expression was also described in several tumour entities. Therefore TMPRSS2 emerged as a potential target for drug design. The catalytic domain of TMPRSS2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and used for an inhibitor screen with previously synthesized inhibitors of various trypsin-like serine proteases. Two inhibitor types were identified which inhibit TMPRSS2 in the nanomolar range.

The bearish events in tourism industry can evoke public panic about future stock market. Tourism companies struggled to maintain their business and positively coped with the emergencies. Meanwhile, the influence of covid-19 was gradually weakened. As situation improved, some investors started to be optimistic about tourism stock prices in the long term. From the phenomenon, we reckon the investor sentiment can influence stock prices. Besides, news about finance and tourism can represent the industry situations and influence the stock prices. In our work, we used investor sentiment and news sentiment polarity combining history stock transaction data to build features in stock price prediction. Multinomial Naive Bayes was used to train and obtain amounts of investor comments sentiment. Lexicon based approach was used to obtain news sentiment polarity. We used XGBoost model to do stock price prediction based on the features we built. The results showed it's an effective way to use sentiment do tourism stock price since the sentiment attributes increased prediction precision.

Thus far, no specific therapy has been found for the coronavirus family. Vaccination still becomes the most effective prevention of pathogenic infections, including viral infections. However, little data show that this vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 virus for a long time. Thus, revaccination needs to be regularly carried out to prevent the occurrence of COVID-19. Vaccination by injection is invasive, and it becomes one of the reasons people refuse to get revaccinated. Therefore, we developed a less invasive vaccine based on oral or nasal administration. The gene encoding the high conserved region (HCR) spike protein was inserted into pNZ8149 and expressed in L. lactis NZ3900. Results: : The results of nasal and oral administration in experimental animals showed that L. lactis carrying the HCR gene could induce a humoral immune response, as indicated by an increasing IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG/IgA-SARS-CoV-2) levels and the lymph cell population after nasal and oral vaccination in mice (p<0.05).

Given that pregnant women are excluded from these trials, we aimed to investigate their safety when used during pregnancy within a unique population source. METHODS: Using the population-based Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, we identified women who delivered a singleton liveborn (1998-2015). Taking potential confounders into account including indications for use, the risk of prematurity, low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), and major congenital malformation (MCM) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drug use during pregnancy were quantified using generalized estimation equations. RESULTS: Of the 231,075 eligible pregnancies, 107 were exposed to dexamethasone (0.05%), 31 to interferons (0.01%), 1,398 to heparins (0.60%), 24 to angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) (0.01%), 182 to chloroquine (0.08%), 103 to hydroxychloroquine (0.05%), 6,206 to azithromycin (2.70%), 230 to oseltamivir (0.10%), and 114 to HIV medications (0.05%). Adjusting for potential confounders, we observed an increased risk of prematurity related to dexamethasone (aOR 1.92, 95%CI 1.11-3.33; 15 exposed cases), anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.58, 95%CI 1.31-1.91; 177 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.04, 95%CI 1.01-4.11; 20 exposed cases) use. An increased risk for LBW associated with anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.72, 95%CI 1.41-2.11; 152 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.48, 95%CI 1.25-4.90; 21 exposed cases) use were also found. Gestational exposure to anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.20, 95%CI 1.00-1.44; 176 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.61, 95%CI 1.51-4.51; 30 exposed cases) were associated with SGA.

In the present experiment, we tested the impact of face masks on the readability of emotions. The participants (N=41, calculated by an a priori power test;random sample;healthy persons of different ages, 18-87 years) assessed the emotional expressions displayed by twelve different faces. Each face was randomly presented with six different expressions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad) while being fully visible or partly covered by a face mask. Lower accuracy and lower confidence in ones own assessment of the displayed emotions indicate that emotional reading was strongly irritated by the presence of a mask. We further detected specific confusion patterns, mostly pronounced in the case of misinterpreting disgusted faces as being angry plus assessing many other emotions (e.g. happy, sad and angry) as neutral. We discuss compensatory actions that can keep social interaction effective (e.g. body language, gesture and verbal communication), even when relevant visual information is crucially reduced.","output":"Wearing face masks strongly confuses counterparts in reading emotions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of quality improvement collaboratives to implement large-scale change in the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, specifically for improving outcomes in patients undergoing primary, elective total hip or knee replacement. METHODS: We undertook a two-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial comparing the roll-out of two preoperative pathways: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) decolonisation (infection arm) and anaemia screening and treatment (anaemia arm). NHS Trusts are public sector organisations that provide healthcare within a geographical area. NHS Trusts (n = 41) in England providing primary, elective total hip and knee replacements, but that did not have a preoperative anaemia screening or MSSA decolonisation pathway in place, were randomised to one of the two parallel collaboratives. Collaboratives took place from May 2018 to November 2019. Twenty-seven Trusts completed the trial (11 anaemia, 16 infection). Outcome data were collected for procedures performed between November 2018 and November 2019. Co-primary outcomes were perioperative blood transfusion (within 7 days of surgery) and deep surgical site infection (SSI) caused by MSSA (within 90 days post-surgery) for the anaemia and infection trial arms, respectively. Secondary outcomes were deep and superficial SSIs (any organism), length of hospital stay, critical care admissions and unplanned readmissions. Process measures included the proportion of eligible patients receiving each preoperative initiative. RESULTS: There were 19,254 procedures from 27 NHS Trusts included in the results (6324 from 11 Trusts in the anaemia arm, 12,930 from 16 Trusts in the infection arm). There were no improvements observed for blood transfusion (anaemia arm 183 (2.9%); infection arm 302 (2.3%) transfusions; adjusted odds ratio 1.20, 95% CI 0.52C2.75, p = 0.67) or MSSA deep SSI (anaemia arm 8 (0.13%); infection arm 18 (0.14%); adjusted odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.42C2.46, p = 0.98). There were no significant improvements in any secondary outcome. This is despite process measures showing the preoperative pathways were implemented for 73.7% and 61.1% of eligible procedures in the infection and anaemia arms, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted retrospective review of all patients who were admitted with COVID-19 and developed bleeding events between March and June 2020. Data were analyzed in accordance with three major outcomes. Mortality within 30 days of bleeding episode, resolution of the bleeding event, and the type of bleeding event. RESULTS: Of 122 bleeds, there was 55 (28 %) gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. Overall mortality was 59 % (n = 72). The prevalence of therapeutic invasive interventions was 11.5 % (n = 14) all were successful in resolving the bleeding event. We found that having a GI bleeds was associated with higher risk of mortality compared to non-GI bleeds (p = 0.04) and having occult bleeds to be associated with 15 times increased risk of mortality (OR 15, 95%CI 1.97C29.1, p = 0.01). Furthermore, patients who were on no anticoagulation (none) (OR 0.1, 95%CI 0.01C0.86, p < 0.00), on prophylactic dose anticoagulation (OR 0.07, 95%CI 0.02C0.28, p = 0.03) or intermediate dose anticoagulation (OR 0.36, 95%CI 0.09C1.34, p = 0.13) were less likely to die than patients on therapeutic dose. CONCLUSIONS: The best approach to manage COVID-19 bleeding patients is to prioritize therapies that manage sepsis induce coagulopathy and shock over other approaches. In COVID-19 patients routine prescription of supra-prophylactic dose anticoagulation should be revisited and more individualized approach to prescription should be the norm.

Reduced necessity for a physical presence of the patient within the healthcare setting is of particular benefit in the current COVID-19 era. It is also of benefit to a diverse group of patients, for example: those who are geographically distant from the base hospital, those suffering from mobility issues or chronic illness, those who require chaperoning as well as those with limited access to transport. We have developed guidelines for the use of the medical telecommunications platform, Attend Anywhere, which has been utilised across the English and Scottish National Health Services, as well as with the Australian Health service, and is now available in Health Service Executive (HSE) settings. Herein we describe and recommend a process that we have found helpful, and we propose guidelines on how a Health Care Worker (HCW) might consider approaching a virtual consultation when initiating and safely executing a patient encounter on Attend Anywhere, in a secure and efficient manner. The guidelines were created following review of the literature on previous experience by others with this software, as well as recent guidance published by the Irish Medical Council. A proportion of this guidance is transferable to other platforms. Methods We also undertook a short survey of our patients and physicians in Sligo University Hospital, who used Attend Anywhere over a six-week period to gauge their satisfaction levels with the experience., We estimated distance that our patients would have travelled for their appointment had the traditional face-to-face consultation been carried out. We noted whether we considered the medium appropriate for the patient consultations. Results 53 patients took part and satisfaction was rated from satisfied to very satisfied on a 3-point scale for all stakeholders. In addition, we found that remote consultation, when compared to face-to-face consultation, alleviated an average of 144km of unnecessary travel per appointment. Remote consultation was deemed appropriate in all cases and no rescheduled face-to-face appointments were required due to failure of the consultation due to difficulties encountered. Conclusion The authors recommend the implementation of the described guidance, with suggested Checklist, Information leaflet and Consent form, as a means of ensuring the confidentiality of the consultation and to ensure that processes are adhered to that optimise protection for both the patient and the clinician, while reducing the burden of attendance to the healthcare location.","output":"Guidelines for the use of the Attend Anywhere Platform for Telecommunications within the Pain Service."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Binary pointwise labels (aka implicit feedback) are heavily leveraged by deep learning based recommendation algorithms nowadays.

To this end, we propose a momentum contrast framework (MP2) that combines pointwise and pairwise learning for recommendation. MP2 has a three-tower network structure: one user network and two item networks. The two item networks are used for computing pointwise and pairwise loss respectively.

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to determine the relation of ApoA-IV with changes in glucose metabolism and weight after bariatric surgery. SETTING University Hospital. METHODS The patients (n = 49) included lean controls (n = 8) and patients before and after a mean of 7 months after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, n = 12), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 22), or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG, n = 11). ApoA-IV and other hormone assays were performed in the fasting and the postprandial state. Pearson's correlation analyses controlled for baseline BMI and percent excess weight loss (EWL) were used to determine relationships between ApoA-IV levels and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). RESULTS With all bariatric procedures combined, the change in ApoA-IV [533 versus 518 microg/L, P = .813] or ApoA-IV area under the curve (AUC - 1072 versus 1042, P = .939) was not significant. None of the surgeries individually affected levels of fasting or ApoA-IV AUC. Bariatric surgery resulted in a decrease in HOMA-IR (5.3 versus 2.0, P<.001). In the RYGB group, higher baseline ApoA-IV levels correlated with decrease in HOMA-IR [r = -.6, P = .008]. This relationship was independent of EWL and was not observed in the LAGB or SG group. There was no association of ApoA-IV levels with EWL, insulin secretion, Peptide-YY, or leptin levels. CONCLUSION Preoperative ApoA-IV levels, rather than changes in levels, positively correlate with improvements in insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss after RYGB.","output":"Circulating Apolipoprotein A-IV presurgical levels are associated with improvement in insulin sensitivity after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 1 diabetes is on the rise globally; however, the burden of mortality remains disproportionate in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Major concerns are the persistent and disabling polyarthralgia in infected individuals. Here we present the results from a first-in-human trial of the candidate simian adenovirus vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 Chik, expressing the CHIKV full-length structural polyprotein (Capsid, E3, E2, 6k and E1). 24 adult healthy volunteers aged 18C50 years, were recruited in a dose escalation, open-label, nonrandomized and uncontrolled phase 1 trial (registry NCT03590392). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 Chik at one of the three preestablished dosages and were followed-up for 6 months. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 Chik. The secondary objective was to assess the humoral and cellular immunogenicity. ChAdOx1 Chik was safe at all doses tested with no serious adverse reactions reported. The vast majority of solicited adverse events were mild or moderate, and self-limiting in nature.

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has been suggested as a valuable target for antiviral therapeutics because the sequence homology of CoV RdRp is highly conserved. We established a cell-based reporter assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity to test viral polymerase inhibitors. The cell-based reporter system was composed of the bicistronic reporter construct and the MERS-CoV nsp12 plasmid construct. Among the tested nine viral polymerase inhibitors, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, favipiravir, lamivudine, zidovudine, valacyclovir, vidarabine, dasabuvir, and remdesivir, only remdesivir exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition. Meanwhile, the Z-factor and Z-factor of this assay for screening inhibitors of MERS-CoV RdRp activity were 0.778 and 0.782, respectively. Ribavirin and favipiravir did not inhibit the MERS-CoV RdRp activity, and non-nucleoside HCV RdRp inhibitor, dasabuvir, partially inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity. Taken together, the cell-based reporter assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity confirmed remdesivir as a direct inhibitor of MERS-CoV RdRp in cells.

However, in South Africa, access to BM remains limited, hence, there is a need to develop strategies that will enable timely access to BM by all patients who need them. OBJECTIVE To develop a framework for the use of BM in South Africa. METHODS Using a Delphi questionnaire that was developed by integration of the opinions of newly qualified doctors (< 2 years practice), prescribing specialists, and patients using BM, a Delphi method was used to guide an experts' panel into consensus on the different opinions in the questionnaire, and from this, a framework for the use of BM was constructed. RESULTS From the surveys, 76.2% of the newly qualified doctors and 91.7% of the prescribing specialists indicated that they had limited knowledge on the pharmacology of BM, and, respectively, 64.5% and 77.8% admitted that their knowledge on BM was not adequate for prescribing and taking care of patients on BM. Also, 58.3% and 75% of the prescribers indicated that the high cost and the tedious procurement process, respectively, were barriers of access to BM. The Delphi panel reached consensus after 2 rounds, and the resultant framework recommends that, appropriate use of BM requires establishing guidelines for the use of BM, increasing BM content in the medical training programs and information resources used by healthcare professionals, enacting drug regulations and drug policies that will increase availability of BM, offering appropriate patient information and public engagement. CONCLUSION The lack of knowledge on BM by health professionals, together with the high cost and a complex procurement processes are the major impediment to access to BM.

To deconvolute the trauma-induced immune response, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to circulating and bone marrow mononuclear cells in injured mice and circulating mononuclear cells in trauma patients. In mice, the greatest changes in gene expression were seen in monocytes across both compartments. After systemic injury, the gene expression pattern of monocytes markedly deviated from steady state with corresponding changes in critical transcription factors, which can be traced back to myeloid progenitors. These changes were largely recapitulated in the human single-cell analysis. We generalized the major changes in human CD14(+) monocytes into 6 signatures, which further defined 2 trauma patient subtypes (SG1 vs. SG2) identified in the whole-blood leukocyte transcriptome in the initial 12 hours after injury. Compared with SG2, SG1 patients exhibited delayed recovery, more severe organ dysfunction, and a higher incidence of infection and noninfectious complications. The 2 patient subtypes were also recapitulated in burn and sepsis patients, revealing a shared pattern of immune response across critical illness.

METHODS: An ambidirectional population-based cohort study including all confirmed Covid-19 cases admitted to hospital during 1/03-31/05 and those living in home healthcare settings identified through a regional registry and evaluated through medical records, including WHO Clinical Progression Scale (CPS). All patients discharged from hospital were followed-up by structured telephone interview at 4 months post-discharge. Respondents indicated any new or aggravated persisting problems in any of 25 body functions and 12 activity/participation items and rated them for impact on daily life. FINDINGS: Out of 734 hospitalised patients, 149 were excluded, 125 died, and 460 were alive at 4-month follow-up of whom 433 (94.1%) were interviewed. In total, 40% reported impairments and activity/participation limitations affecting daily life and warranted further multi-professional rehabilitation assessment, predominantly those with severe disease and a considerable proportion of those with moderate disease. Cognitive and affective impairments were equally common in all groups and were reported by 20-40% of cases. Limb weakness was reported by 31%, with CPS 7-9 being four times more likely to report this problem as compared to CPS 4-5. 26% of those working or studying reported difficulties returning to these activities, this being 3.5 times more likely in CPS 7-9 as compared to CPS 4-5. 25% reported problems walking >1 km, with CPS 7-9 over three times more likely to report this as compared to the other two sub-groups. 90-day mortality rate of Covid-19 associated deaths was 15.1%.

Effectively such models treat infection and immunity as binary variables. We show here that considering immunity as a continuous variable instead of binary and incorporating factors that bring about small changes in immunity lead to qualitatively different epidemiological predictions. The small immunity effects (SIE) constitute cross immunity by other infections, small increments in immunity by sub clinical exposures and slow decay in the absence of repeated exposure. The SIE model explains many epidemiological patterns observed during the Covid-19 pandemic that are not adequately explained by conventional models. In the SIE model repeated waves are possible without the need for new variants. Peak and decline of a wave much before reaching herd immunity threshold, low level apparently stable existence of the pathogen, new surges after variable and unpredictable gaps, new surge after vaccinating majority of population are the common features of the pandemic mimicked by simulations using the SIE model. The model further shows complex interactions of different interventions that can be contextually synergistic as well as antagonistic. As a result, interventions intended to arrest the transmission are not always effective and can turn counterproductive under some conditions. Interventions that are beneficial in the short run can be potentially hazardous in the long run. In the absence of empirical estimates of many parameters, the model may not be useful to make quantitative predictions at this stage but it certainly challenges traditional wisdom and currently held beliefs behind non-pharmaceutical interventions recommended to control the epidemic. We also suggest testable predictions to differentiate between the causal logic of the SIE model against the prevalent explanations for the same observed phenomena.","output":"Epidemiology: Gray Immunity Model Gives Qualitatively Different Predictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In computer vision, one of the common practices to augment the image dataset is by creating new images using geometric transformation preserving similarity.

However, no studies have compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of such patients. OBJECTIVES: To report and compare the demographic characteristics, treatments, use of critical care resources, and outcomes of patients admitted to an Australian ICU with H1N1 influenza during the winter of 2009, and SARS-CoV-2, during the winter of 2020. METHODS: This was a multicentre project, utilizing national data from previous and ongoing epidemiological studies concerning severe acute respiratory infections in Australia. All ICUs admitting patients with H1N1 or COVID-19 were included and contributed data. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of H1N1 patients admitted to ICU in the winter of 2009 vs COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in the winter of 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Potential years of life lost (PYLL) was calculated according to sex-adjusted life expectancy in Australia. RESULTS: Across the two epochs, 861 patients were admitted to ICUs; 236 (27.4%) with COVID-19, and 625 (72.6%) with H1N1 influenza. The number of ICU admissions and bed-days occupied were higher with 2009 H1N1 influenza. COVID-19 patients were older, more often male and overweight, and had lower APACHE 2 at ICU admission. The highest age-specific incidence of ICU admission was among infants (0 to 1 year of age) for H1N1, and among the elderly (&#8805; 65 years) for COVID-19. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was similar (11.5% in COVID-19 vs. 16.1% in H1N1; odds ratio, 0.68 [95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 1.06]; p = 0.10). The PYLL was greater with H1N1 influenza than with COVID-19 at 154.1 (95% CI, 148.7 to 159.4) vs 13.6 (95% CI, 12.2 to 15.1) PYLL per million inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to 2009 H1N1 influenza, COVID-19 admissions over winter in Australia resulted in fewer ICU admissions, and lower bed-day occupancy. Crude in-hospital mortality was similar, but because of demographic differences in affected patients, deaths due to 2009 H1N1 influenza led to an 11-fold increase in the number of PYLL in critically ill patients.","output":"Comparison of Critical Care Occupancy and Outcomes of Critically ill Patients during the 2020 COVID-19 Winter Surge and 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay explores what to make of the various kinds of moral distress and moral injury increasingly discussed in multiple disciplines and fields of work.

METHODS: Patients healed from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from February 2020 to May 2020 were considered for inclusion in this study, regardless of the severity of the disease during the acute phase. Eligible patients were consecutively contacted and a semistructured interview was administered between February and March 2021 by trained medical staff. RESULTS: Three hundred three patients were eligible and accepted to participate in the study and were enrolled. Of those surveyed, most patients (81%) reported at least 1 symptom, and the most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (52%), pain (48%), and sleep disorders (47%). Sensory alterations were present in 28% of surveyed patients, but in most of these cases (74% of those affected by sensory alterations or 20% of the overall sample) symptoms reported were either anosmia or dysgeusia. Higher prevalence was generally observed with increasing age, although the most relevant differences were observed when comparing young versus middle-aged adults.

This study is premised on the observation that entrepreneurial groups form an interaction arena for the practice of imagining the future and asks how the content of entrepreneurial visions is shaped by the conditions of the group.

We show how the content of entrepreneurial visions is configured by four elements (i.e., fictional expectation for the business or the group; future orientation that is continuing or divergent) and name two group conditions (i.e., role confidence and hierarchical congruence) that direct their configuration. We propose that lacking role confidence can impede thinking about the future of a business and that narrative hierarchies that challenge structural hierarchies can open a window for divergent future orientation. This study contributes to a novel theoretical understanding of where entrepreneurial visions come from by emphasizing politics of expectations within groups and calling to consider group conditions as a relevant context for entrepreneurial visions.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the global impact of emergence. Considering the history and diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), especially in bats, SARS-CoV-2 will likely not be the last to spillover from animals into human populations. We sampled and tested wildlife in the Central African country Cameroon to determine which CoVs are circulating and how they relate to previously detected human and animal CoVs. We collected animal and ecological data at sampling locations and used family-level consensus PCR combined with amplicon sequencing for virus detection. Between 2003 and 2018, samples were collected from 6,580 animals of several different orders. CoV RNA was detected in 175 bats, a civet, and a shrew. The CoV RNAs detected in the bats represented 17 different genetic clusters, coinciding with alpha (n = 8) and beta (n = 9) CoVs. Sequences resembling human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) were found in 40 Hipposideridae bats. Phylogenetic analyses place the human-derived HCoV-229E isolates closest to those from camels in terms of the S and N genes but closest to isolates from bats for the envelope, membrane, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. The CoV RNA positivity rate in bats varied significantly (P < 0.001) between the wet (8.2 per cent) and dry seasons (4.5 per cent). Most sampled species accordingly had a wet season high and dry season low, while for some the opposite was found. Eight of the suspected CoV species of which we detected RNA appear to be entirely novel CoV species, which suggests that CoV diversity in African wildlife is still rather poorly understood. The detection of multiple different variants of HCoV-229E-like viruses supports the bat reservoir hypothesis for this virus, with the phylogenetic results casting some doubt on camels as an intermediate host. The findings also support the previously proposed influence of ecological factors on CoV circulation, indicating a high level of underlying complexity to the viral ecology. These results indicate the importance of investing in surveillance activities among wild animals to detect all potential threats as well as sentinel surveillance among exposed humans to determine emerging threats.","output":"Wildlife in Cameroon harbor diverse coronaviruses, including many closely related to human coronavirus 229E"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Cerebral oxygenation monitoring via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is increasingly becoming an accepted and valued component of intraoperative monitoring. In recent years, new devices have become available which all make different claims. The purpose of this study is to examine the research on these individual devices to establish the levels of evidence for each and formulate a research path for further evaluation of this technology in cardiac surgery. METHODS This study is a systematic review of published research on cerebral oximetry. We searched PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus for full-length, peer-reviewed articles containing original data resulting from the study of patient neurologic outcomes based on the use of FDA-approved near-infrared spectroscopy devices. The studies were then grouped and classified based on the device used and the levels of evidence each study provided. RESULTS Only a very limited number of high-level clinical evidence research papers are currently available, with nearly all of those papers based on the INVOS system. This is likely due to the different lengths of time each device has been on the market and its availability for use in clinical trials. Challenges to testing include the expense of testing various devices, the lack of a globally accepted gold standard for cerebral oxygenation saturation, the limited availability of patient frontal surface area and the gradual adoption of this technology. Despite these limitations, significant results have been identified in relation to patient outcomes. CONCLUSION At this time, there is limited high-level evidence available for all of the NIRS devices on the market despite significant outcomes found in these studies.

Important plant-derived ingredients used in the global herbal cosmetic industry are essential oils, colorants, oils, fats, and waxes. The traditional usage of 108 medicinal plant species (belonging to 58 families) in cosmetic treatments was identified from the local books of Sri Lanka. Of these, 49 plant species were reported as new ingredients for the herbal cosmetic industry. However, the lack of ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological surveys to identify the cosmetic potential plants, insufficient or absence of continuous supply of raw materials for production in line with the existing demand, the lack of quality control of raw materials and finished cosmetic products, improper systematic cultivation systems for medicinal plants, poor postharvest practices, and the lack of innovations are major challenges encountered in Sri Lanka for the development of the herbal cosmetic industry. In conclusion, addressing these vital knowledge gaps is a timely requirement of the country for the sustainable development of the herbal cosmetic industry in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, assembling of the multidisciplinary cooperation of botanists, chemists, toxicologists, researchers, and biologists is crucial to analyze the interesting functional properties, efficacy, and effectiveness of documented medicinal plants with cosmetic potential.","output":"Global Perspective of Plant-Based Cosmetic Industry and Possible Contribution of Sri Lanka to the Development of Herbal Cosmetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) strain was isolated from a pup with fatal diarrhea, which had a concurrent infection by canine parvovirus type 2. The reovirus isolate showed an atypical hemagglutination pattern and a retarded electrophoretic mobility of the S1 segment, which is characteristic of MRV type 3 (MRV-3). Assignment of the isolated virus to MRV-3 was confirmed by type-specific RT-PCR assays, targeting the S1 gene, and by subsequent sequence analysis of the PCR product. By phylogeny based on the S1 gene of several MRVs, the isolate fell into lineage E, along with the murine strain T3C9/61 and the bovine strains T3C18/61 and T3C31/59. Conversely, L1 sequences were found to segregate regardless of the viral type. A total of 110 fecal samples, 56 nasal and 31 ocular swabs from dogs with diarrhea or nasal/ocular discharge were tested by a nested-PCR assay specific for reoviruses, and no sample was found to contain MRV RNA, a finding that is apparently in contrast with the seroprevalence (25.77%) observed in dogs.","output":"Virological and molecular characterization of a mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 strain isolated from a dog in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pathogenesis of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is determined by a complex interaction of environmental, infectious, and host factors.

To maintain a safe environment for all patients and staff, we established an admission screening plan of testing for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 to determine the presence of asymptomatic patients who were infected with the virus upon admission. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of patients who test positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 but were presumed to be COVID\\\\19 negative at the time of admission to IRF in New Jersey. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 testing results. SETTING: Four freestanding IRFs in New Jersey operated as one system. PATIENTS: All (N=103) patients sequentially admitted from April 4 C27, 2020 with no symptoms or evidence of COVID\\\\19 disease at the time of transfer from the acute hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Specimens were collected for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 analysis at the time of admission to the IRF and patients were monitored for subsequent symptom development over the next 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 testing upon admission and evidence of development of clinical signs or symptoms of COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: Seven asymptomatic persons (6.8% of admissions) without clinical signs/symptoms of COVID\\\\19 tested positive on admission. Of these, five developed symptoms of COVID\\\\19, with a mean onset of 3.2 (range of 2\\\\5) days. Five additional patients became symptomatic and tested positive within the next 3\\\\10 days (mean of 5.2 days). Overall, 11.6% of admissions (12/103) had a positive test within 14 days of admission. CONCLUSIONS: Admission testing to post\\\\acute centers for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 can help identify pre\\\\symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, especially in areas where COVID\\\\19 is prevalent. Negative results however, do not preclude COVID\\\\19 and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. This article is protected by copyright.

The World Health Organization has urged the public to wear face masks as part of the countermeasure. As the demand for face masks increased, research on the environmental sustainability of face masks production started to emerge. However, the scope of the prior studies is limited to environmental impacts during the manufacturing process. Broadening the research scope is critical to acquire a comprehensive environmental impact analysis. Therefore, this study investigates the life cycle impact assessment of disposable face mask production, from raw material extraction to the point of sale, by adopting the life cycle assessment method. Disposable face masks are assessed for a single person, over one functional unit (FU) of 30 12-h days. The ReCiPe approach was used with a Hierarchist perspective. The results reveal that disposable face mask manufacture contributes significantly to enormous environmental impact categories. As a solution, this study proposes a reconfiguration of the manufacturing process, by altering the design and material proportion of the earloop to minimise the environmental impact. The investigation indicates that the proposed design might decrease the global warming contribution, from 1.82593 kg CO2 eq. to 1.69948 kg CO2 eq.","output":"A Sustainable Approach towards Disposable Face Mask Production Amidst Pandemic Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) poses serious challenges to people's health worldwide.

Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects.

We have begun virtually in this field since COVID-19 pandemic, besides our divergence in the infectious agents. In this study and based on the previous review, Hypericum perforatum (St. Johns Wort) and Echinacea (gaia HERBS?) were tested in vitro using Vero E6 cells for their anti-viral effects against the newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through its infectious cycle from 0 to 48 hours post infection. The hypericin (0.9 mg) of H. perforatum and the different parts (roots, seeds, aerial) of two types of Echinacea species (Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia) were examined their efficacy in certain concentration and under light-dependent anti-viral activities to measure the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA expression of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and the viral load with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and to assess the neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding on cell culture assay. Interestingly, the mixture (H.E.) of 100 mg/mL of H. perforatum and Echinacea was tested too on SARS-CoV-2 and showed crucial anti-viral activity competing H. perforatum then Echinacea effects as anti-viral treatment. Therefore, the results of gaia HERBS? products, H. perforatum and Echinacea species, applied in this study showed significant anti-viral and virucidal effects in the following order of potency: H. perforatum, H.E., and Echinacea on SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle; and will definitely required a set up of clinical trial with specific therapeutic protocol based on the outcome of this study. Author Summary After an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in the Southern region of Saudi Arabia, particularly in May 2003, Special Infectious Agents Unit (SIAU) was established and founded by Prof. Esam Ibraheem Azhar. This unit contains a full range of facilities including Biosafety Level 3, allows him and his research groups to ambulate and culture risk group 3 viruses in Saudi Arabia & Gulf States for the first time. Since that time, SIAU and our international collaboration have been extended to implement a standard protocols in the infectious agents diagnostics procedure through different mode of collaboration including exchange of expertise, joint research program and more recently a technology transfer agreements with number of international institute sharing same interests. Furthermore, we have been engaged in number of researches related to Hajj & Umrah plus number of national services with the Ministry of Health (MOH) through which, we utilize our Mobile biosafety level 3 Lab to enhance the diagnostics of MERS CoV in the Holly sites during Hajj since 2014.

AIMS: The aim of our study was to investigate the impact SARS-CoV-2 and public health restrictions had on trauma presentations to a regional paediatric emergency service. METHODS: We carried out a multisite retrospective longitudinal study of all paediatric ED attendances from 2018 including 13 March to 7 June 2020. This aligned with the initial government-enforced public health phases: delay phase, mitigation phase and reopening phase 1. RESULTS: There were 7975 total regional attendances during government-enforced restrictions. This represents 17.5% and 15.6% reductions in site attendances when compared with the two previous years. Regional attendances reduced by 52.5% in 2020 compared with 2018 and 50.9% compared with 2019. Following an initial reduction in injury attendances at the beginning of the 'lockdown' (p = 0.076), the number of injuries consistently grew as weeks progressed (p < 0.05), reaching a peak of 44.6% of all attendances. As restrictions eased, the most common location where injuries occurred moved to areas outside the home (p < 0.000). There was a significant change in injury type, final disposition and device-associated injury (p < 0.05). Wheeled recreational devices were associated with over 20% of all injuries by reopening phase 1. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that total attendances and total injuries reduced during initial phases of the lockdown. This was followed by a significant increase in injury presentations, which reached a peak of 44.6% of all attendances. We identified potential modifiable characteristics of paediatric trauma which can be addressed by future public health strategies.","output":"The effect of national public health measures on the characteristics of trauma presentations to a busy paediatric emergency service in Ireland: a longitudinal observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing the comfort of vaccine delivery at school is needed to improve the immunization experience for students.

METHODS: From April 2020 to February 2021, we enrolled 228 donors. At each study visit, subjects either donated plasma or had study samples drawn only. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 donor testing was performed using the VITROS? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and IgG assays, and an in-house fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA). RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified in 97% of COVID-19 convalescent donors at initial presentation. In follow up analyses, of the 116 donors presenting for repeat timepoints, 91.4% of donors had detectable IgG levels up to 11 months post-symptom recovery, while 63% had detectable neutralizing titers, however, we observed that 25% of donors had neutralizing levels that dropped to an undetectable titer over time.

Items assessed generalized anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior, and the subjective risk perception of regarding symptoms, having a severe course and dying because of COVID-19. Data were compared between participants with the high risk diseases and individuals without any of those diseases. 16,983 respondents completed the study. Generalized anxiety, COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior and subjective risk perception were elevated in participants with high-risk diseases. The increased COVID-19-related fear as a functional concern is a conclusion on the increased risk of a severe course. The functionality of the fear is reflected in peoples increased need for security and includes an increase in both adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior that underlines the need for psychological support strategies.","output":"Increased COVID-19-related fear and subjective risk perception regarding COVID-19 affects behavior in individuals with internal high-risk diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Keywords: Undergraduate;On-line learning;Practical skills Purpose: Due to the hands-on nature of physiotherapy effective teaching and learning of practical skills is an essential component of student education in preparation for clinical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic, has led to the increasing use of digital resources and the need for more effective evaluation of the use of video tutorials in student education. This study evaluates whether first year undergraduate physiotherapy students have a preference for in class teaching or video tutorials. Methods: This mixed methods study comprised the collection of qualitative and quantitative data. Forty-eight first year undergraduate physiotherapy students were first exposed to a video tutorial which taught a skill prior to performing it in a classroom setting. This was followed by a second practical class, this time adopting a traditional live demonstration of a different skill by the same teacher. Students were then required to perform this skill in the classroom. Student preference for the two approaches of teaching was determined and ability to achieve the two skills were graded. Results: A significant number of students preferred the traditional teaching method to the use of video tutorials stating that it made learning easier. However, student grades were consistently higher following the video tutorial. Due to varying levels of participant uptake for undergoing grading and the limited number of participants graded, the results were not generalisable. Conclusion(s): Students preferred the traditional teaching method because it allowed them more interaction with the teacher and the opportunity to ask questions throughout the demonstration. The research suggests video tutorials have a role as an adjunct to practical teaching but not an alternative to traditional live demonstrations. Impact: The research suggests video tutorials have a role as an adjunct but not an alternative to traditional live demonstrations. Students stated that they prefer traditional live demonstrations, however, students level of skill increased following the use of video tutorials. Further research is required to ascertain the value of using interactive on-line tutorials as an alternative to face to face classroom teaching and the influence of learning via video tutorials on students future clinical practice and service user care.

While communication tools, networks and systems exist, current evidence suggests that they are only useful within particular contexts and several only target specific geographic areas. There is a need to unpack and explore the mechanisms of how and in what context such communication tools and their components are effective at facilitating international communication and coordination to keep food safe and mitigate the burden of foodborne disease around the world. A realist synthesis was undertaken to understand how and why certain processes and structures of communication tools, used during international food safety events, influence their utility and effectiveness according to different contextual factors. The focus of this review was explanatory and aimed to develop and refine theory regarding how contextual factors trigger specific processes and mechanisms to produce outcomes. Using the realist contextCmechanismCoutcome configuration of theory development, a range of sources was used to develop an initial programme theory, including the authors experience, a scoping review of published papers and grey literature and input from an expert reference committee. Literature was then systematically located and synthesised from several databases with input from the expert reference committee to refine the programme theory. The programme theory developed indicates that when a country has interests in food import or export, has the technical infrastructure to detect and respond to food safety events, and is governed in accordance with regional and/or global laws and regulations relating to food control and global health security, then specific mechanisms will facilitate various outcomes. Mechanisms include trust, experience, support, awareness, understanding, a sense of community, standardisation and intersectoral collaboration. The outcomes include using communication tools to relay information abroad and the prevention of foodborne diseases, among others. Components of such communication tools may be adapted according to different contextual factors to promote, support and improve their use. Improving international coordination and communication during international food safety events is in the interest of global health security and can mitigate the global burden of foodborne disease.

We aimed to analyze cognitive decline during the pandemic year in people evaluated in a memory clinic in northern Italy, the epicenter of COVID-19 spread. (2) Methods: A single-center retrospective study was carried out, including individuals with annual follow-up evaluated in three different years (2020-GROUP, 2019-GROUP, 2018-GROUP). We performed an intergroup comparison of cognitive decline over a one-year follow-up, and an intragroup comparison in the 2020-GROUP to analyze the five-year cognitive decline trajectory, as measured by the MMSE.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from psychiatric professionals in 34 hospitals between 29 January and 7 February 2020, in China. Hospitals equipped with fever clinics or deployed on wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. PRIMARY OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress were assessed by the Chinese versions of 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index and 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression and structural equation modelling was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 610 psychiatric professionals were included. 29.8% were employed in Wuhan, and 22.5% were frontline workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (461 (75.6%)), anxiety (282 (46.2%)), insomnia (336 (55.1%)) and mental stress (481 (78.9%)). Psychiatric symptoms were associated with worrying about infection (eg, OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.39) for anxiety), risks of exposure to COVID-19 (eg, having inadequate personal protection equipment, OR 2.43 (1.32 to 4.47) for depression) and self-perceived physical health (eg, OR 3.22 (2.24 to 4.64) for mental stress). Information sources of COVID-19 were also found to be both positively (eg, information from relatives, OR 2.16 (1.46 to 3.21) for mental stress) and negatively (eg, information from TV, OR 0.52 (0.35 to 0.77) for mental stress) associated with mental stress. There is preliminary evidence that mental health might benefit from greater availability of mental healthcare services. The structural equation model analysis indicated that worrying about infection may be the primary mediator via which risk of exposure to COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of psychiatric professionals.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations between bacterial, viral, and bacterial plus viral isolations and bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS: In this prospective study, we enrolled 108 patients who were followed up every 3C6 months and at onset of exacerbations between March 2017 and November 2018. Spontaneous sputum was split for detection of bacteria (routine culture) and viruses (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Symptoms and lung function were assessed during exacerbations. RESULTS: The median exacerbation rate was 2.0 (interquartile range: 1.0C2.5) per patient-year. At any visit, viral isolations (V+) occurred more frequently during onset of exacerbations [odds ratio (OR): 3.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.76C6.12], as did isolation of new bacteria (NB+) (OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.35C4.71) and bacterial plus viral isolations (OR: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.11C4.55). Whilst coryza appeared more common in exacerbations with V+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with NB+, lower airway symptoms were more severe in exacerbations with NB+ (P < .05). Sputum interleukin-1 levels were higher in exacerbations with NB+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with V+ (both P < .05). Significantly more coryza symptoms correlated with bacterial plus viral isolations at exacerbations (P = .019). Compared with V+ alone, bacterial with and without viral isolations tended to yield more severe lower airway symptoms, but not sputum cytokine levels at exacerbations.

Objective Using interview and match data, we quantify the predicted effects if anesthesiology residency programs excluded interviews for applicants who are very unlikely to match. Methods We previously published the validity and accuracy of the logistic regression model based on data from interview scheduling software used by 32 U.S. anesthesiology residency programs and 1300 applicants from 2015-18. Data used were program region, applicant address, numbers of interviews of the interviewee, medical school US News and World Report (USNWR) rank, the difference between United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 and 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) scores, and the historical average of USMLE scores of program residents. In the current study completed in 2020, the predicted probabilities and their variances were summed among interviewees for 30 deidentified programs. Results For anesthesiology, the median residency program could reduce their interviews by 16.9% (97.5% confidence interval 8.5%-24.1%) supposing they would not invite applicants if the 99% upper prediction limit for the probability of matching was less than 10.0%. The corresponding median savings would be 0.80 interviews per matched spot (0.34-1.33). In doing so, the median program would sustain a risk of 5.3% (97.5% confidence interval 2.3%-7.9%) of having at least one interviewee removed from their final rank-to-match list. Conclusion Using novel interview data and analyses, we demonstrate that residency programs can substantively reduce interviews with less effect on rank-to-match lists.

Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta-analyses. The Cochrane database was searched on November 1, 2020 with \\"COVID.\\" With adding up four articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews were considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Increasing number of clinical trials from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests were realized as its side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in a higher viral clearance than remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical trials.

Unlike other recent studies that focused on airborne transmission routes, this work addresses aerosol transport and deposition in a human respiratory tract. The contribution therefore conducts a computational study of aerosol deposition in digital replicas of human airways, which include the oral cavity, larynx and tracheobronchial airways down to the 12th generation of branching. Breathing through the oral cavity allows the air with aerosols to directly impact the larynx and tracheobronchial airways and can be viewed as one of the worst cases in terms of inhalation rate and aerosol load. The implemented computational model is based on Lagrangian particle tracking in Reynolds-Averaged NavierCStokes resolved turbulent flow. Within this framework, the effects of different flow rates, particle diameters and lung sizes are investigated to enable new insights into local particle deposition behavior and therefore virus loads among selected age groups. We identify a signicant increase of aerosol deposition in the upper airways and thus a strong reduction of virus load in the lower airways for younger individuals. Based on our findings, we propose a possible relation between the younger age related fluid mechanical protection of the lower lung regions due to the airway size and a reduced risk of developing a severe respiratory illness originating from COVID-19 airborne transmission.","output":"Can CFD establish a connection to a milder COVID-19 disease in younger people?

Twenty samples (nine rivaroxaban, five apixaban, three warfarin, and three heparin) were also compared using CAT (5 pM tissue factor). RESULTS: TG reduction in DrugScreen depended on the specific drug and modestly correlated with DOAC levels (lag time R(2) = 0.36; peak R(2) = 0.50). The best correlation was observed with peak thrombin and rivaroxaban\\\\specified antiCactivated factor X (anti\\\\Xa) activity (R(2) = 0.60). When comparing ST Genesia with CAT, only the results for apixaban concorded (R(2) = 0.97).

CONCLUSION: The ST Genesia data did not correlate with CAT, but it was independently associated with INR, anti\\\\Xa, and DOAC concentrations.

From March 2020, hospitals in the UK saw a dramatic reduction in patients with cancer presenting due to multifactorial reasons. The impact of the pandemic on patients with cancer in the South East London Cancer Alliance was studied. The specific aims were (1) to examine the reduction in cancer diagnoses during the first wave of the pandemic and (2) to examine the stage of diagnosis of patients with cancer presenting during the pandemic compared with that of patients presenting before the pandemic. There was an 18.2% reduction in new cancer diagnoses (an estimate of 987 cancers), when compared with 2019. This fall in cancer diagnoses was most marked in patients with prostate (51.4%), gynaecological (29.7%), breast (29.5%) and lung (23.4%) cancers. There was an overall 3.9% increase in advanced stage presentation (Stages 3 and 4), with an overall 6.8% increase in Stage 4 cancers during this period. The greatest shifts were seen in lung (increase of 6.3%, with an 11.2% increase in Stage 4 cancer alone) and colorectal (5.4%) cancers. For prostate cancer, there was an increase in 3.8% in those presenting with Stage 4 disease. For breast cancer, there was an 8% reduction in patients diagnosed with Stage 1 cancer with commensurate increases in the proportion of those with Stage 2 disease. The experiences in cancer are a salient warning that pandemic control measures and policy need to balance all health and welfare. Alternative strategies need to be adopted during further waves of the current and any future pandemic to ensure that patients with cancer are prioritised for diagnosis and treatment to prevent late-stage presentation and an increase in avoidable deaths.","output":"The impact of national non-pharmaceutical interventions (lockdowns) on the presentation of cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic diseases are defined as the temporary accumulation of dangerous infections diseases in certain areas.

Policy makers need informationpreferably based on real-time dataon peoples cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions to public health messages and restrictive measures. PubliCo aims to foster effective and tailored risk and crisis communication as well as provide an assessment of the risks and benefits of prevention and control measures, since their effectiveness depends on public trust and cooperation. OBJECTIVE: Our project aims to develop a tool that helps tackle the COVID-19 infodemic, with a focus on enabling a nuanced and in-depth understanding of public perception. The project adopts a transdisciplinary multistakeholder approach, including participatory citizen science. METHODS: We aim to combine a literature and media review and analysis as well as empirical research using mixed methods, including an online survey and diary-based research, both of which are ongoing and continuously updated. Building on real-time data and continuous data collection, our research results will be highly adaptable to the evolving situation.

The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the most commonly utilized techniques for SLR. MATERIALS AND METHODS Network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare no reinforcement (NR), suture oversewing (SR), glue reinforcement (GR), bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement (Gore? Seamguard?) (GoR), and clips reinforcement (CR). Risk Ratio (RR), weighted mean difference (WMD), and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were used as pooled effect size measures. RESULTS Overall, 3994 patients (17 RCTs) were included. Of those, 1641 (41.1%) underwent NR, 1507 (37.7%) SR, 689 (17.2%) GR, 107 (2.7%) GoR, and 50 (1.3%) CR. SR was associated with a significantly reduced risk of bleeding (RR=0.51; 95% CrI 0.31-0.88), staple line leak (RR=0.56; 95% CrI 0.32-0.99), and overall complications (RR=0.50; 95% CrI 0.30-0.88) compared to NR while no differences were found vs. GR, GoR, and CR. Operative time was significantly longer for SR (WMD=16.2; 95% CrI 10.8-21.7), GR (WMD=15.0; 95% CrI 7.7-22.4), and GoR (WMD=15.5; 95% CrI 5.6-25.4) compared to NR.

Although rates of AMR have risen significantly in adults over the past few years, increasing rates of AMR are now being seen in children. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is a highly effective approach to tackling AMR;however few paediatric AMS initiatives have focused on antibiotic prescribing in an Emergency Department (ED) setting. There are data to suggest that rates of antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is higher in children presenting to emergency departments than in those presenting with comparable disease severity to primary care.ObjectivesThe focus of this study was to evaluate the impact of two sequential antimicrobial stewardship interventions on antibiotic prescribing for children aged <16 years presenting with upper and lower respiratory tract infections to the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) at Southampton Childrens Hospital.MethodsAntibiotic prescribing data were collected over a 16 week period (03/08/2020C22/11/20). All children with a discharge diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), otitis media, tonsillitis, pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were included. Baseline data were collected between weeks 1C7. The 1st AMS intervention was a 15-minute educational session delivered either face to face or virtually to all PED clinicians by a PED consultant (DJ). The educational intervention used informational slide sets to reinforce the principles of judicious antibiotic use and appropriate antibiotic guideline adherence for RTIs through case-based learning scenarios and quizzes that facilitated group discussion. This intervention was repeated weekly between weeks 8C10, to ensure that all PEM staff were exposed to the intervention. The 2nd intervention, implemented on week 14, involved feedback of personalised antibiotic prescribing data, along with average antibiotic prescribing rates for the department, to each member of PED staff.Results502 children with RTIs presented during the study period. Antibiotic prescribing rates significantly decreased from 28.6% during the pre-intervention period to 20.5% at the end of the study (p<0.05). Antibiotic prescribing for a discharge diagnosis of URTI decreased from 9.3% to 4.8% (p=0.11), for otitis media from 78.9% to 53.8% (p=0.13), for tonsillitis from 71.8% to 48.8% (p=0.03) and for LRTI and pneumonia from 66.7% to 51.7% (p=0.31).ConclusionsThe combination of an educational intervention and individualised feedback of prescribing data was associated with a significant reduction in overall antibiotic prescribing for children with RTIs managed in an ED setting. However, although reductions were seen for individual pathologies, statistical significance was not always reached. This may be due to the relatively small sample size;far fewer children were recruited during the 16 week study period than predicted due to the impact of the COVID pandemic on rates of PED presentations. In general the interventions were easy to implement;however manual interrogation of patient notes was required to collect individual clinician prescribing data, this was labour intensive and would ideally be automated through the use of electronic prescribing systems. Further work is required to show if the findings from this study can be replicated in other settings and if this impact is sustained or requires repeated AMS interventions.","output":"Evaluating the impact of antimicrobial stewardship interventions in a UK paediatric emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic suggests that there are opportunities to improve preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks. While much attention has been given to understanding national-level preparedness, relatively little attention has been given to understanding preparedness at the local-level. We, therefore, aim to describe (1) how local governments were engaged in epidemic preparedness efforts before the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) how they were coordinating with authorities at higher levels of governance before COVID-19. We developed an online survey and distributed it to 50 cities around the world involved in the Partnership for Healthy Cities. The survey included several question formats including free-response, matrices, and multiple-choice questions. RACI matrices, a project management tool that helps explain coordination structures, were used to understand the level of government responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed regarding select preparedness activities. We used descriptive statistics to summarize local-level engagement in epidemic preparedness. Local health authorities from 33 cities completed the survey. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 20 of the cities had completed infectious disease risk assessments, 10 completed all-hazards risk assessments, 11 completed simulation exercises, 10 completed after-action reviews, 19 developed preparedness and response plans, three reported involvement in their countrys Joint External Evaluation of the International Health Regulations, and eight cities reported involvement in the development of their countries National Action Plan for Health Security. RACI matrices revealed various models of epidemic preparedness, with responsibility often shared across levels, and national governments accountable for the most activities, compared to other governance levels. In conclusion, national governments maintain the largest role in epidemic and pandemic preparedness but the role of subnational and local governments is not negligible. Local-level actors engage in a variety of preparedness activities and future efforts should strive to better include these actors in preparedness as a means of bolstering local, national, and global health security.","output":"How do local-level authorities engage in epidemic and pandemic preparedness activities and coordinate with higher levels of government?

Here we sought to quantify the demographic characteristics of the volunteers and post-mortem human subjects (PMHSs) used to create the available biomechanical data for the human neck during automotive impacts. A systematic literature and database search was conducted to identify kinematic data that could be used to characterize the neck response to inertial loading or direct head/body impacts.

We found that the neck biomechanical data were biased toward males, the volunteer data were younger, and the PMHS data were older than the reference populations. Other smaller biases were also noted, particularly within female distributions, in the height, weight, and BMI distributions relative to the neck-injured populations.

Plasma concentrations of lysine and arginine were assessed at the beginning (baseline) and end of the study. Three times a week, cats were assigned a clinical score based on evidence of nasal and ocular disease. Conjunctival and oropharyngeal swab specimens were tested for FHV-1, FCV, and C felis nucleic acids once a week. RESULTS Data were collected from 123, 74, 59, and 47 cats during study weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. By study end, plasma lysine concentration in treated cats was greater than that in control cats and had increased from baseline. There was no difference between dietary groups in the proportion of cats developing mild disease. However, more treated cats than control cats developed moderate to severe disease during week 4. During week 2, FHV-1 DNA was detected more commonly in swab specimens from treated versus control cats.

This study describes the experiences after repurposing a PICU and its staff for adult critical care within a state mandated COVID-19 hospital and compares the outcomes to adult patients admitted to the institution's MICU during the same period. Design: A retrospective chart review was performed to analyze outcomes for the adults admitted to the PICU and MICU during the 27-day period the PICU was incorporated into the institution's adult critical care surge plan. Setting: Tertiary care state University hospital. Patients: Critically ill adult patients with proven or suspected COVID-19. Interventions: To select the most ideal adult patients for PICU admission a tiered approach that incorporated older patients with more comorbidities at each stage was implemented. Measurements and Main Results: There were 140 patients admitted to the MICU and 9 patients admitted to the PICU during this period. The mean age of the adult patients admitted to the PICU was lower (49.1 vs. 63.2 p = 0.017). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of comorbidities, intubation rates, days of ventilation, dialysis or LOS. Patients selected for PICU care did not have coronary artery disease, CHF, cerebrovascular disease or COPD.

Knockdown of circRNA_0043691 was then constructed and verified by qRT-PCR. Cell viability, migration, and invasion capacity were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, Transwell migration, and invasion, respectively. Next, knockdown of miR-873-3p was constructed and co-cultured with circRNA_0043691 knockdown to identify whether knockdown of miR-873-3p could attenuate the circRNA_0043691 knockdown on GC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. The relationship between miR-873-3p and circRNA_0043691 or GART was predicted by bioinformatics tools and verified by dual-luciferase reporter. A total of 211 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, including 143 remarkably downregulated circRNAs and 68 significantly upregulated circRNAs.

In the last decade, immunotherapy has become an important strategy for the management of HCC. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to establish an immune-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy response in HCC. METHODS We identified immune-related differentially expressed genes (IRDEGs) based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) database. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Cox proportional hazard model were utilized to determine hub immune-related genes (IRGs). The TIDE tool and R package pRRophetic were used to assess the correlation between the immune-related gene signature and the clinical responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS By using WGCNA combined with Cox proportional hazard model, PRC1, TOP2A, TPX2, and ANLN were identified as hub IRGs. The prognostic value of the newly developed gene signature (IRGPI) was demonstrated in both the TCGA database and the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) database. The TIDE tool showed that the high- and low-IRGPI groups presented significantly different tumor immune microenvironment and immunotherapy responses. Furthermore, the high-IRGPI group also had significantly lower chemoresistance to cisplatin compared to the low-IRGPI group.

Ten years later, between 2014 and 2015, the chikungunya virus spread throughout the Americas, affecting millions of people. The objective of this review is to describe the contributions of research on chikungunya virus infection gained from epidemic in the West Indies and the Guiana Shield. RECENT FINDINGS: Prevalence data were similar to those found in the Indian Ocean or Asia during epidemics. Clinically, there is now a better understanding of the typical, atypical, and severe forms. Several studies have insisted on the presence of neurological forms of chikungunya infection, such as encephalitis or GuillainCBarr syndrome. Cases of septic shock due to chikungunya virus as well as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were described for the first time. Given the magnitude of the epidemic and the large number of people affected, this has led to a better description and new classifications of chikungunya virus infections in specific populations such as pregnant women, the elderly, and children. Several studies also described the behavior of populations faced with an emerging disease. SUMMARY: Current epidemiological data from tropical regions highlights the risk of spreading emerging diseases at higher latitudes, especially concerning arboviruses, since the vector Aedes albopictus is already established in many parts of northern countries. A better understanding of the disease and its epidemic dynamics will foster better management, the crucial importance of which was demonstrated during the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Contribution of Research in the West Indies and Northeast Amazonia to Knowledge of the 2014C2015 Chikungunya Epidemic in the Americas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on the American healthcare system and economy.

Household chaos may act upon maternal behaviors of physical activity and sleep, potentially via higher stress. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationships among household chaos, maternal stress, and maternal physical activity and sleep, and identify barriers to home organization during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online survey of 1721 mothers of preschoolers (ages = 3.0-5.9 years) in the United States was conducted in May 2020 during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and early reopening. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, stress, physical activity and sleep, and barriers to home organization during the outbreak. Mediation models were conducted among household chaos, stress, and physical activity and sleep with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: About half of mothers were middle income (48.2%), employed full-time prior to the outbreak (59.1%), and met the physical activity (47.7%), and sleep guideline (49.7%, 7-9 h/day). Household chaos and stress were both negatively related to physical activity and sleep. For every 1 unit increase in mother's current stress, mothers were 11% (95% confidence interval = 6% to 16%) less likely to meet the physical activity guideline and 19% (95% confidence interval = 14% to 23%) less likely to meet the sleep guideline. Household chaos was positively related to stress. Stress partially mediated the relationship between household chaos and physical activity and sleep. Virus concerns, occupational changes (i.e. teleworking), and lack of childcare were barriers to home organization. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, many mothers had poor sleep and physical activity, which was associated with household chaos and stress.

Therefore, we aimed to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted common risk factors identified in two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers. RESULTS: Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and relevant cohort studies, we found out that (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Risk factors of COVID-19 mortality: a systematic review of current literature and lessons from recent retracted articles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucolipidosis II (ML II) or inclusion cell disease (I-cell disease) is a rarely occurring autosomal recessive lysosomal enzyme-targeting disease. This disease is usually found to occur in individuals aged between 6 and 12 months, with a clinical phenotype resembling that of Hurler syndrome and radiological findings resembling those of dysostosis multiplex. However, we encountered a rare case of an infant with ML II who presented with prenatal skeletal dysplasia and typical clinical features of severe secondary hyperparathyroidism at birth. A female infant was born at 37(+1) weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 1,690 g (<3rd percentile). Prenatal ultrasonographic findings revealed intrauterine growth retardation and skeletal dysplasia. At birth, the patient had characteristic features of ML II, and skeletal radiographs revealed dysostosis multiplex, similar to rickets. In addition, the patient had high levels of alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone, consistent with severe secondary neonatal hyperparathyroidism. The activities of -D-hexosaminidase and -N-acetylglucosaminidase were moderately decreased in the leukocytes but were 5- to 10-fold higher in the plasma. Examination of a placental biopsy specimen showed foamy vacuolar changes in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. The diagnosis of ML II was confirmed via GNPTAB genetic testing, which revealed compound heterozygosity of c.3091C>T (p.Arg1031X) and c.3456_3459dupCAAC (p.Ile1154GlnfsX3), the latter being a novel mutation.

Anxiety, depression, burn out and the high proportion of post-traumatic stress disorder proved to be the most expected troubles caused by this pandemic and the confinement. Medico-psychological emergency units (CUMP) have been solicited at the very early stage of the pandemic because CUMP units are very well known by the French government and systematically associated to emergency plans. METHODS In this article we describe the process which has been developed to cope with the psychological needs in the general population. At a first level, platforms of volunteers specialised into listening were available. Then those platforms could directly mobilise the CUMP in case of psychiatric disorders. It ran over the whole first wave and it has been reactivated because of the second confinement in France. RESULTS During the first wave, approximately 1% of all the calls made on the national Covid number required to be redirected to the listening platforms. Of this group, 4% were related to reactive pathology or a psychiatric decompensating that required adapted and specialised care. CONCLUSION The high rates of psychological distress detected in the general population in recent scientific literature seem discrepant with our findings of relatively low reorientation towards the CUMP. Nevertheless, our study highlights that the response of the CUMP network in France during the first wave was supportive. The second wave displays its adaptability to the public health policies.","output":"An appropriate and reactive response to the repeated waves of the COVID-19 pandemic by the national medico-psychological network (CUMP) in France."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the causative agents of human multiple sclerosis (MS) are not known, it is suspected that a viral infection may be associated with the initiation of the disease.

An abrupt ending of lockdown can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything;therefore, carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.","output":"Modelling the role of media induced fear conditioning in mitigating post-lockdown COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives on India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Chemosensory disorders associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been widely mentioned during the pandemic.

Implemented applications have been analyzed and discussed from the perspective of technologies, potentially overlooking how formulation of the digital health landscape for COVID-19 was contributed by policy directives. This study aimed to understand the contexts and key mechanisms in China's rapid mobilization of digital health interventions in response to COVID-19, to document and share lessons learned. Methods Policy documents were identified and retrieved from government portals and recognized media outlets. Data on digital health interventions were collected through three consecutive surveys administered between 23 January, 2020 and 31 March, 2020 by the Chinese Academy of Information and Communication Technology (CAICT) affiliated to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Participants were member companies of the Internet Health alliance established by MIIT and the National Health Commission (NHC) in June 2016. Self-report digital interventions focusing on social and economic recovery were excluded. Two hundred and sixty-six unique digital health interventions meeting our criteria were extracted from 175 narratives on digital health interventions submitted by 116 participating companies. Thematic analysis was conducted to describe the scope and priority of policies advocating for the use of digital health technologies and the implementation pattern of digital health interventions. Data limitations precluded an evaluation of the impact of digital health interventions over a longer time frame. Results Between January and March 2020, national policy directives promoting the use of digital technologies for the containment of COVID-19 collectively advocated for use cases in emergency planning and preparedness, public health response, and clinical services. Interventions to strengthen clinical services were mentioned more than the other two themes (n=15, 62.5%). Using digital technologies for public health response was mentioned much less than clinical services (n=5, 20.8%). Emergency planning and preparedness was least mentioned (n=4, 16.7%). Interventions in support of clinical services disproportionately favored healthcare facilities in less resource-constraint settings. Digital health interventions shared the same pattern of distribution. More digital health technologies were implemented in clinical services (n=103, 38.7%) than that in public health response (n=91, 34.2%). Emergency planning and preparedness had the least self-reported digital health interventions (n=72, 27.1%). We further identified case studies under each theme in which the wide use of digital health technologies highlighted contextual factors and key enabling mechanisms. Conclusions The contextual factors and key enabling mechanisms through the use of policy instruments to promote digital health interventions for COVID-19 in China include pathway of policy directives influencing the private sector using a decentralized system, the booming digital health landscape before COVID-19, agility of the public sector in introducing regulatory flexibilities and incentives to mobilize the private sector.

The latest is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an emerging global threat with no current effective treatment. Normal intravenous immunoglobulin (N-IVIG) has been administered to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients to control severe inflammation and the cellular immune response. However, the neutralizing activity of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine whether N-IVIG manufactured before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic contained IgG antibodies against the circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that cross-react with the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. No cases of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV have been reported in Japan. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The neutralizing and binding activities of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV 229E, and HCoV OC43 were evaluated. Nine N-IVIG lots manufactured between 2000 and 2018, derived from donors in Japan, were tested. Binding activity was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS None of the N-IVIG lots tested displayed neutralizing or binding activity against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2. However, they displayed substantial neutralizing and binding activity against HCoV OC43 and weak neutralizing and substantial binding activity against HCoV 229E. CONCLUSION N-IVIG derived from healthy donors in Japan before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic had no direct effect against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are warranted to determine the effects of N-IVIG manufactured after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Neutralizing and binding activities against SARS-CoV-1/2, MERS-CoV, and human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 by normal human intravenous immunoglobulin derived from healthy donors in Japan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic, which occured in Wuhan, China, spread to many countries of the World in a short time In our country preventive precautions were taken in accordance with the epidemic plan covering the society as a whole In this process, pandemic action decisions were started to be implemented by family physicians, following the directives of the ministry of Health In this context, precautions which taken to prevent the spread of the virus, evaluation and isolation of risky patients have an important role in epidemic control and it should be continued until the last case is seen","output":"Pandemic Process in Primary Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Reduced mortality at 28 days in patients treated with corticosteroids was demonstrated, but this result was not confirmed by certain large epidemiological studies. Our aim was to determine whether corticosteroids improve the outcomes of our patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Our retrospective, single centre cohort study included consecutive patients hospitalized for moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia between March 15 and April 15 2020. An early short course of corticosteroids was given during the second phase of the study. The primary composite endpoint was the need for mechanical ventilation or mortality within 28 days of admission. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the propensity score, i.e. the probability of each patient receiving corticosteroid therapy based on the initial variables. RESULTS: About 120 consecutive patients were included, 39 in the \\"corticosteroids group\\", 81 in the \\"no corticosteroids group\\"; their mean ages (SD) were 66.4  14.1 and 66.1  15.2 years, respectively.

The aim of our study was to examine the effect of carbonation on penetrationCaspiration and pharyngeal residue in dysphagia patients using Fiber-Optic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) and to identify parameters associated with a response to carbonation. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients undergoing FEES in a dysphagia clinic. Patients were offered 100 cc of dyed water. PenetrationCaspiration was scored using the penetrationCaspiration scale (PAS). Residue was scored using the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPR-SRS). Patients with a PAS  2 for water were subsequently offered 100 cc of carbonated water. PAS, YPR-SRS and residue clearance were compared between thin and carbonated liquids. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for good response to carbonation. RESULTS: 84 patients were enrolled, 77.4% males, with diverse dysphagia etiologies (58.3% neurogenic, 11.9% radiation-induced, 23.8% deconditioning-induced, and 6% neck surgery induced). Median PAS was 7 (IQR 4C8) for thin liquids and 4.5 (IQR 2C8) for carbonated liquids (P = 0.0001). YPR-SRS was reduced for carbonated compared to thin liquids in the vallecula (1.58  0.83 vs 1.76  0.93, P = 0.001) and piriform sinuses (1.5  0.87 vs 1.67  0.9, P = 0.002). 31 patients had improvement in PAS with carbonation.

The proposed framework consists of four main steps: data pre-processing, model pre-training and weight saving, the weight fine-tuning, trend predicting and validating. It is concluded that the proposed framework based on IndRNN and fine-tuning with high speed and low complexity, has great fitting and prediction performance. The applied fine-tuning strategy can effectively reduce the error by up to 20.94% and time cost. For most of the countries, the MAPEs of fine-tuned IndRNN model were less than 1.2%, the minimum MAPE and RMSE were 0.05%, and 1.17, respectively, by using Chinese deaths, during the testing phase. According to the prediction and validation results, the MAPEs of the proposed framework were less than 6.2% in most cases, and it generated lowest MAPE and RMSE values of 0.05% and 2.14, respectively, for deaths in China.

It is observed that countries having a routine BCG vaccination programme, have shown to have lower incidence of COVID-19, suggesting some protective mechanisms of BCG against COVID-19 in such countries. In countries like India despite vast population density and other adversities, and growing numbers of COVID19 infections, the mortality rate and severity of COVID has been low in comparison to some TB non-endemic countries (like Europe and USA). In addition, there are evidences that BCG vaccination offers partial protection and survival in low-income countries where tuberculosis is prevalent. The nonspecific effects (NSEs) of immune responses induced by BCG vaccination protect against other infections seem to be due to its immunological memory eliciting lymphocytes response and trained immunity. The protective effect on other viral infection in humans are believed to be mediated by heterologous lymphocyte activation and the initiation of innate immune memory may be applicable to SARS CoV2. The BCG vaccination at birth does not have a protective effect beyond childhood against COVID-19. In adults, there might be other factors dampening the virulence and pathogenicity of COVID-19.

Therefore, patients with complex congenital heart lesions have a high risk of developing severe complications and worse outcomes. This paper aims to determine the characteristics and outcome of pediatric congenital heart disease (CHD) patients infected by COVID-19 at Sanglah hospital. CASE SUMMARY: Within the period of March 2020 to February 2021, there were 12 cases of pediatric CHD accompanied by COVID-19 infection, which consists of 8 females and 4 males within the age of 6 days to 18 years. Based upon symptomatic CHD classification, there were 4 cyanotic CHD cases and 1 acyanotic case, respiratory problems were reported in all 5 cases. These are pneumonia in 4 cases and respiratory distress caused by hyaline membrane disease (HMD) in 1 case. 2 cases require mechanical ventilation. The outcome of all inpatient cases were favorable. DISCUSSION: To date, there are only few scientific evidence detailing how COVID-19 affects CHD. We were unable to calculate the correlation analysis since the population sample was too small. The most severe cases that requires mechanical ventilation had comorbidities in the form of malnutrition and down syndrome. From the perspective of pathophysiology, one of the most important factor determining outcome was the severity of CHD itself. Other contributing factors were COVID-19s destructive effect on heart tissue and co-infection by other microorganism.","output":"C94.

The sense of touch represents the most direct and intimate channel of communication and a powerful means of connection between the self and the others. In our digital age, the development and diffusion of internet-based technologies and virtual environments offer new opportunities of communication overcoming physical distance. It however, happens that social interactions are often mediated, and the tactile aspects of communication are overlooked, thus diminishing the feeling of social presence, which may contribute to an increased sense of social disconnection and loneliness. The current manuscript aims to review the extant literature about the socio-affective dimension of touch and current advancements in interactive virtual environments in order to provide a new perspective on multisensory virtual communication. Specifically, we suggest that interpersonal affective touch might critically impact virtual social exchanges, promoting a sense of co-presence and social connection between individuals, possibly overcoming feelings of sensory loneliness. This topic of investigation will be of crucial relevance from a theoretical perspective aiming to understand how we integrate multisensory signals in processing and making sense of interpersonal exchanges, this is important in both typical and atypical populations.

In response to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, a new initiative to support health care staff to share healthy meals with their families was developed. At a hospital in Queensland, Australia, dietetic staff collaborated with the on-site food service retailer to develop and offer a range of hot meals that staff could take home for their families at the end of their day. The meals were nutritious, reasonably priced, and designed to feed a family of four. The dietetic staff worked with the hospital marketing department and staff health and wellness program to promote the initiative. Over the 3 months that it has been running, nearly 300 meals have been purchased. Anecdotal comments from the food service retailer highlighted that the initiative was a good thing to do for staff to maintain a positive reputation of the business. The staff evening meal initiative is a healthy, affordable, educational, and socially engaging alternative to takeaway meals and food delivery by app, and it is mutually beneficial for health care staff and the on-site food retailer.

This testing is due to the possibility of unidentified cases, especially ones without COVID-19 related symptoms. This review aimed to examine the outcome of the existing studies on the ways of identifying COVID-19 cases, and determine the populations at risk, symptom and diagnostic test management of COVID-19. Methods: : The articles reviewed were scientific publications on the PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Scopus databases. The keywords used to obtain the data were COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and case detection, case management or diagnostic test. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Population, Intervention, Control and Outcomes (PICO) approaches. Results: : A total of 21 articles from 13 countries met the inclusion criteria and were further analyzed qualitatively. However, 62% of the articles used a rapid antibody test for screening rather than a rapid antigen test. According to the rapid antigen test, 51.3% were positive, with men aged above 50 years recording the highest number of cases. Furthermore, 57.1% of patients were symptomatic, while diagnostic tests' sensitivity and specificity increased to 100% in 14 days after the onset. Conclusion: s: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is recommended by the World Health Organization for detection of COVID-19. Suppose it is unavailable, the rapid antigen test is used as an alternative rather than the rapid antibody test. Diagnosis is expected to be confirmed using the PCR and serological assay to achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19, according to disease progression, gradual rapid tests can be used, such as rapid antigen in an earlier week and antibody tests confirmed by RTCPCR and serological assay in the second week of COVID-19.","output":"A systematic review of the case findings, testing and management of COVID-19 (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs).

As a result of the quarantine enforced by governments and authorities worldwide, people had to suddenly adapt their daily routines, including work, study, diet, leisure and fitness activities to the new circumstances. A growing body of research indicates that the engagement with virtual reality (VR) activities can have a positive impact on users mental and physical wellbeing. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VR activities on users under lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. An online survey was carried out to investigate the recreational use of VR during the lockdown period and to gather users opinions on its impact on their physical and mental health. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the responses provided by the 646 participants. The results of the survey show that VR use has significantly increased during the lockdown period for most participants, who expressed overwhelmingly positive opinions on the impact of VR activities on their mental and physical wellbeing. Strikingly, self-reported intensity of physical activity was considerably more strenuous in VR users than in console users. Given the current uncertainty as to the duration and course of the pandemic, as well as the possibility of intermittent lockdown in the upcoming years, the outcomes of this study could have a significant impact towards the development and deployment of VR-based strategies aimed at helping the population cope with prolonged social distancing, with particular regards to vulnerable individuals.","output":"Impact of the recreational use of virtual reality on physical and mental wellbeing during the Covid-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astroviruses (AstVs) are non-enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses that cause a wide range of inflammatory diseases in mammalian and avian hosts. The T = 3 viral capsid is unique in its ability to infect host cells in a process driven by host proteases. Intercellular protease cleavages allow for viral egress from a cell, while extracellular cleavages allow for the virus to enter a new host cell to initiate infection. High-resolution models of the capsid core indicate a large, exposed region enriched with protease cleavage sites. The virus spike protein allows for binding to target cells and is the major target for naturally occurring and engineered neutralizing antibodies. During maturation, the capsid goes through significant structural changes including the loss of many surface spikes. The capsid interacts with host membranes during the virus life cycle at multiple stages such as assembly, host cell entry and exit. This review will cover recent findings and insights related to the structure of the capsid and its function.

We hypothesized that multivessel intracranial dolichoectasia may represent a distinct phenotype from single-territory vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. The purpose of this study was to characterize clinical characteristics and angiographic features of this proposed distinct phenotype termed \\"diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia\\" and compare them with those in patients with isolated vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia and compared their demographics, vascular risk factors, additional aneurysm prevalence, and clinical outcomes with a group of patients with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. \\"Diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia\\" was defined as aneurysmal dilation of entire vascular segments involving 2 intracranial vascular beds. Categoric and continuous variables were compared by using 2 and Student t tests, respectively. RESULTS Twenty-five patients had diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia, and 139 had vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. Patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia were older than those with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (70.9  14.2 years versus 60.4  12.5 years, P = .0002) and had a higher prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (62.5% versus 14.3%, P = .01), other visceral aneurysms (25.0% versus 0%, P < .0001), and smoking (68.0% versus 15.9%, P < .0001). Patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia were more likely to have aneurysm growth (46.2% versus 21.5%, P = .09) and rupture (20% versus 3.5%, P = .007) at follow-up. Patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia were less likely to have good neurologic function at follow-up (24.0% versus 57.6%, P = .004) and were more likely to have aneurysm-related death (24.0% versus 7.2%, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS The natural history of patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia is significantly worse than that in those with isolated vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. Many patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia had additional saccular and abdominal aortic aneurysms.

To contain the outbreak, a rapid and adequate emergency response was vital to control emergent public health risks, but emergency management was challenged by large uncertainty due to many unknowns about crucial determinants of the outbreak, determining the effectiveness of the response, which was often derived from uncertain information. This paper aims to draw lessons from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and it presents a review of strategies for emergency response pursued in eight European countries, including tipping points that triggered strategy shifts in emergency response. The paper shows that: (i) these countries have a culturally determined preference for policy response style (Mediterranean, continental and liberal style) depending on their relative scores on power distance and uncertainty avoidance, which (ii) is reflected in the initially adopted control paradigm and the associated strategy;(iii) Mediterranean countries (Italy, France, Spain) with high levels of power distance and uncertainty avoidance have a tendency to respond to new unknown situations by deploying strong rule-based regulatory systems which offer mental security and social order, whereas continental (Germany and Austria) and liberal countries (the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden) do this to medium and much lower extents.","output":"Cope or Perish?

The association between hepatic steatosis, which frequently accompanies obesity, and the pneumonia severity score (PSS) evaluated on computed tomography (CT), and the prevalence of steatosis in patients with COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. AIM: To assess the frequency of hepatic steatosis in the chest CT of COVID-19 patients and its association with the PSS. METHODS: The chest CT images of 485 patients who were admitted to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups as COVID-19-positive [CT- and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive] and controls (CT- and RT-PCR-negative). The CT images of both groups were evaluated for PSS as the ratio of the volume of involved lung parenchyma to the total lung volume. Hepatic steatosis was defined as a liver attenuation value of &lt;= 40 Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: Of the 485 patients, 56.5% (n = 274) were defined as the COVID-19-positive group and 43.5% (n = 211) as the control group. The average age of the COVID-19-positive group was significantly higher than that of the control group (50.9 +/- 10.9 years vs 40.4 +/- 12.3 years, P &lt; 0.001). The frequency of hepatic steatosis in the positive group was significantly higher compared with the control group (40.9% vs 19.4%, P &lt; 0.001).

RESULTS: The response rate from USC general surgery residents was 100%. A majority of residents (76%) had utilized either video- or telephone-based visits during their careers. No resident had undergone formal training to provide telemedicine, although most residents indicated a desire for training (57.1%) and acknowledged that telemedicine should be a part of surgical training (75.6%). A wide variety of opinions regarding the educational experience of residents participating in telemedicine visits was elicited. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic brought telemedicine to the forefront as an integral part of future patient care, including for surgical patients. Additional investigations into nationwide telemedicine exposure and practice among United States general surgery residencies is imperative, and the impact of the implementation of telemedicine curricula on general surgery resident telemedicine utilization, comfort with telemedicine technology, and patient outcomes are further warranted.

Conversion of the two spot-tests in an upper limb musculoskeletal anatomy unit of study from FR to a novel MC format, where one of five tagged structures on a specimen was the answer to each question, provided a unique opportunity to assess the comparative validity and reliability of FR and MC formatted spot-tests and the impact on student performance following the change of test format to MC. Three successive year cohorts of health science students (n=1,442) were each assessed by spot-tests formatted as FR (first cohort) or MC (following two cohorts). Comparative question difficulty was assessed independently by three examiners. There were more Higher Order Cognitive Skill questions and more of the course objectives tested in the MC-formatted tests. Spot-test reliability was maintained with Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients  0.80 and 80% of the MC items of high quality (having point biserial correlation coefficients > 0.25). These results also demonstrated guessing was not an issue. The mean final score for the MC-formatted cohorts increased by 4.9%, but did not change for the final theory examination that was common to all three cohorts. Subgroup analysis revealed that the greatest change in spot-test marks was for the lower-performing students.

Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT) has developed full online courses from the first semester (spring semester) in April 2020. However, the increase of the infection has remained constant, and TUAT will continue to provide online courses using the web conferencing tool from the second semester (fall semester) in October 2020, and hybrid courses that combine face-to-face teaching. To support this, a campus-wide license was purchased that enables the use of three different web conferencing tools including Zoom Meeting, Cisco Webex, and Google Meet in the suitable applications. For the start of the second semester, the Information Media Center (IMC) has developed a system to integrate with the existing authentication system to enable use of the these three tools.

The Covid-19 shutdown imposed a restructuring of the content, sequence, and scope of the curriculum. While certain topics were omitted or reduced in scope, others-especially those related to digital instruction-were introduced or expanded. Pedagogy instructors also began to attend to their students' well-being by introducing SEL contents and activities.

Both processes participate in osteoarthritis (OA). We predicted that LINC00707 and miR-199-3p may interact with each other. Therefore, LINC00707 and miR-199-3p may interact with each other to participate in OA. In this study, the expression of LINC00707 and miR-199-3p in both OA and normal articular cartilage tissues was analyzed using RT-qPCR. The subcellular location of LINC00707 and its direct interaction with miR-199-3p were explored by nuclear fractionation assay, RNA pull-down assay and Luciferase reporter assay, respectively. The role of LINC00707 and miR-199-3p in regulating the expression of each other was analyzed using an overexpression assay, followed by RT-qPCR. The role of LINC00707 and miR-199-3p in regulating OA chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis was analyzed by BrdU assay and cell apoptosis assay, respectively. OA tissues exhibited increased expression of LINC00707 and decreased expression of miR-199-3p. LINC00707 directly interacted with miR-199-3p in cytoplasm.

The main outcome was the longitudinal assessment of the physiological preterm head development with cephalometric size (head circumference, cranial volume) and shape parameters (cranial index, cranial vault asymmetry index) according to chronological and postmenstrual age (PMA). Potential clinical risk factors for the development of an abnormal low cranial index (dolichocephaly) were analysed. In serial measurements of 26 infants, the estimated head volume (95% confidence interval) increased from 244 (226C263) cm(3) at 28 weeks PMA to 705 (688C721) cm(3) at 40 weeks PMA. Moderate or severe dolichocephaly occurred in 21/26 infants (80.8%). Cranial index decreased over time (72.4%; 70.7C74 95% confidence interval). Brachycephaly and plagiocephaly were uncommon. No risk factors for severe dolichocephaly were identified. Our study shows that early detection of head shape and size anomalies utilizing 3D stereophotogrammetry is feasible and safe even in very preterm infants < 1500 g and/or < 32 weeks. 3D stereophotogrammetry could be used for timely identification of infants at risk for head shape anomalies.

In the process of diagnosing COVID-19 and treating patients, automatic COVID-19 lesion segmentation from computed tomography images helps doctors and patients intuitively understand lung infection. To effectively quantify lung infections, a convolutional neural network for automatic lung infection segmentation based on deep learning is proposed. METHOD: This new type of COVID-19 lesion segmentation network is based on a U-Net backbone. First, a coarse segmentation network is constructed to extract the lung areas. Second, in the encoding and decoding process of the fine segmentation network, a new soft attention mechanism, namely the dilated convolutional attention (DCA) mechanism, is introduced to enable the network to focus on better quantitative information to strengthen the network's segmentation ability in the subtle areas of the lesions. RESULTS: The experimental results show that the average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and area under the curve of DUDA-Net are 87.06%, 90.85%, 99.59% and 0.965, respectively. In addition, the introduction of a cascade U-shaped network scheme and DCA mechanism can improve the DSC by 24.46% and 14.33%, respectively.

To this end, we used COVID-19 data until June 10, 2020 together with population health data for the United States at the county level. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models using influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population as the independent variable and the number of deaths from COVID-19 as the outcome variable. We adjusted for a wide array of potential confounding variables using both county-level generalized propensity scores for influenza vaccination rates, as well as direct adjustment. Our results suggest that influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19. This finding is robust to using different analysis periods, different thresholds for inclusion of counties, and a variety of methodologies for confounding adjustment. In conclusion, our results suggest a potential protective effect of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 mortality in the elderly population.

The objective of this study was to understand the contribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) to the platelet phenotype via phenotypic (activation, aggregation) and transcriptomic characterization. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In a cohort of 3915 hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients, we analyzed blood platelet indices collected at hospital admission. Following adjustment for demographics, clinical risk factors, medication, and biomarkers of inflammation and thrombosis, we find platelet count, size, and immaturity are associated with increased critical illness and all\\\\cause mortality. Bone marrow, lung tissue, and blood from COVID\\\\19 patients revealed the presence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virions in megakaryocytes and platelets. Characterization of COVID\\\\19 platelets found them to be hyperreactive (increased aggregation, and expression of P\\\\selectin and CD40) and to have a distinct transcriptomic profile characteristic of prothrombotic large and immature platelets. In vitro mechanistic studies highlight that the interaction of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 with megakaryocytes alters the platelet transcriptome, and its effects are distinct from the coronavirus responsible for the common cold (CoV\\\\OC43). CONCLUSIONS: Platelet count, size, and maturity associate with increased critical illness and all\\\\cause mortality among hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients. Profiling tissues and blood from COVID\\\\19 patients revealed that SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virions enter megakaryocytes and platelets and associate with alterations to the platelet transcriptome and activation profile.","output":"Platelets contribute to disease severity in COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Emergency departments (EDs) in NHS hospitals in England have faced considerable increases in demand over recent years. Most hospitals have developed general practitioner services in emergency departments (GPEDs) to treat non-emergency patients, aiming to relieve pressure on other staff and to improve ED efficiency and patient experience. We measured the impact of GPED services on patient flows, health outcomes and ED workload. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. Differences in GPED service availability across EDs and time of day were used to identify the causal effect of GPED, as patients attending the ED at the same hour of the day are quasi-randomly assigned to treatment or control groups based on their local EDs service availability. PARTICIPANTS: Attendances to 40 EDs in English NHS hospitals from April 2018 to March 2019, 4 441 349 observations. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURED: Outcomes measured were volume of attendances, non-urgent attendances, waiting times over 4 hours, patients leaving without being treated, unplanned reattendances within 7 days, inpatient admissions and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We found a small, statistically significant reduction in unplanned reattendances within 7 days (OR 0.968, 95% CI 0.948 to 0.989), equivalent to 302 fewer reattendances per year for the average ED. The clinical impact of this was judged to be negligible. There was no detectable impact on any other outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: We found no adverse effects on patient outcomes; neither did we find any evidence of the hypothesised benefits of placing GPs in emergency settings beyond a marginal reduction in reattendances that was not considered clinically significant.","output":"Does the presence of general practitioners in emergency departments affect quality and safety in English NHS hospitals?

The use of machine learning seems to be a great way to improve the accuracy of empirical equations currently used in this field. Accordingly, this study utilized tree predictive models (i.e., random forest (RF), random tree (RT), and classification and regression trees (CART)) as well as a novel feature selection (FS) technique to introduce a new model capable of estimating the punching shear capacity of the SFRC flat slabs. Furthermore, to automatically create the structure of the predictive models, the current study employed a sequential algorithm of the FS model. In order to perform the training stage for the proposed models, a dataset consisting of 140 samples with six influential components (i.e., the depth of the slab, the effective depth of the slab, the length of the column, the compressive strength of the concrete, the reinforcement ratio, and the fiber volume) were collected from the relevant literature. Afterward, the sequential FS models were trained and verified using the above-mentioned database. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed models for both testing and training datasets, various statistical indices, including the coefficient of determination (R(2)) and root mean square error (RMSE), were utilized. The results obtained from the experiments indicated that the FS-RT model outperformed FS-RF and FS-CART models in terms of prediction accuracy. The range of R(2) and RMSE values were obtained as 0.9476C0.9831 and 14.4965C24.9310, respectively; in this regard, the FS-RT hybrid technique demonstrated the best performance. It was concluded that the three hybrid techniques proposed in this paper, i.e., FS-RT, FS-RF, and FS-CART, could be applied to predicting SFRC flat slabs.","output":"A Novel Feature Selection Approach Based on Tree Models for Evaluating the Punching Shear Capacity of Steel Fiber-Reinforced Concrete Flat Slabs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveThis study investigated the experience of patients with chronic diseases regarding access to and utilisation of multidisciplinary care during COVID-19 in South Australia.MethodsTelephone interviews were conducted with 30 patients with chronic conditions attending nine general practices in metropolitan Adelaide. Supplementary data were obtained from the Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) to compare health services activity data provided by different health professionals before and after COVID-19 (from January 2019 to June 2020).ResultsThere was variation in access to different health services by patients with chronic conditions during COVID-19. The introduction of telehealth facilitated continuity of general practitioner (GP) services, with a high level of satisfaction among patients. Changes in medicines regulation, including the home delivery of medications, enabled timely access to medications for patients. The use of telehealth was less common for specialist and particularly allied health services. Dental check-ups that are important for the management of some chronic conditions were disrupted the most during COVID-19.ConclusionThe findings of this study suggest that the policy measures introduced in Australia provided an opportunity to maintain multidisciplinary care for patients with chronic diseases during COVID-19. GPs, as core members of the primary healthcare team, as well as pharmacy and pathology services, were highly accessible. Telehealth was less accessed for chronic care services provided by specialists and allied health professionals.What is known about the topic?Access to multidisciplinary care is critical to ensure continuity and quality of care for patients with chronic health conditions. Evidence suggests disruptions in health services can occur during pandemics. To continue access to routine care, the Australian Government introduced several policy initiatives during COVID-19 to enhance access to multidisciplinary care.What does this paper add?Telehealth policy was particularly effective in facilitating patients' access to general practice services during COVID-19 particularly those services that did not need physical examinations. This policy complemented changes in medicines regulations that enabled timely and convenient access to medications for patients with chronic conditions. Allied health services, as important elements of multidisciplinary care, were more likely to be disrupted during COVID-19.What are the implications for practitioners?Continuation of telehealth services is likely to enhance access to general practice services. The acceptability and use of telehealth for allied health services may require more flexibility, and training for both practitioners and patients.","output":"Experiences of patients with chronic diseases of access to multidisciplinary care during COVID-19 in South Australia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To develop an ethically, legally, and clinically appropriate ventilator allocation policy for AdventHealth Tampa and AdventHealth Carrollwood in Tampa, Florida, which could be enacted swiftly during the Covid-19 pandemic During Spring 2020, a subcommittee of the Medical Ethics Committee established consensus on the fundamental principles of the policy, then built on existing ethical, legal, and clinical guidance The plan was finalized in May 2020 The plan triages patients based on exclusion criteria (imminent mortality), prognosis and expected benefit of ventilation (using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), and change in prognosis over time Decisions are made by committee in order to minimize moral distress among individual patient care providers Due to international concerns about healthcare resource shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitals need allocation policies informed by the crisis standard of care, the hospitals ethical duty to plan for an emergency, and federal civil rights laws Policy Implications: This type of policy can serve as a model for other institutions to develop crisis standards of care resource allocation policies, which are a necessary component of disaster planning [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Clinical Ethics is the property of Sage Publications, Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Planning for scarcity: Developing a hospital ventilator allocation policy for Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has led to a shift towards online therapy This paper focuses on therapists experiences of translating systemic practice online with families A range of UK services are represented, including community, inpatient, adult and children services A social construction theory, coordinated management of meaning, is used to understand online family and systemic therapy The new context of online therapy influenced all other levels of the therapeutic encounter including content and structure of sessions, therapeutic relationship, therapists identity and culture of therapy The relationship between doing online therapy and reflecting on practice has been central in co-constructing new ways of interacting There were many similarities across services, where there were differences these were client and context specific As better ways of engaging emerged, therapists became more confident, creativity in therapy increased and attitudes about online therapy became more positive Practitioner points: Online systemic therapy is possible across adult and children services at different tiers within community and inpatient settings CMM provides a framework to understand communication in online therapy Online therapy requires reconsiderations at all levels of the therapeutic encounter Increased confidence and competence correlates with positive attitudes about online therapy Online therapy is impacting on the overall evolving culture of therapy ? 2021 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice","output":"Holding onto the mystery within online family and systemic therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic currently in process differs from other infectious disease calamities that have previously plagued humanity in the vast amount of information that is produced each day, which includes daily estimates of the disease incidence and mortality data. Apart from providing actionable information to public health authorities on the trend of the pandemic, the daily incidence reflects the process of disease in a susceptible population and thus reflects the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the public health response, and diagnosis and reporting. Both new daily cases and daily mortality data in the United States exhibit periodic oscillatory patterns. By analyzing New York City (NYC) and Los Angeles (LA) testing data, we demonstrate that this oscillation in the number of cases can be strongly explained by the daily variation in testing. This seems to rule out alternative hypotheses, such as increased infections on certain days of the week, as driving this oscillation. Similarly, we show that the apparent oscillation in mortality in the U.S. data are mostly an artifact of reporting, which disappears in data sets that record death by episode date, such as the NYC and LA data sets. Periodic oscillations in COVID-19 incidence and mortality data reflect testing and reporting practices and contingencies. Thus, these contingencies should be considered first prior to suggesting biological mechanisms. IMPORTANCE The incidence and mortality data for the COVID-19 data in the United States show periodic oscillations, giving the curve a distinctive serrated pattern. In this study, we show that these periodic highs and lows in incidence and mortality data are due to daily differences in testing for the virus and death reporting, respectively. These findings are important because they provide an explanation based on public health practices and shortcomings rather than biological explanations, such as infection dynamics. In other words, when oscillations occur in epidemiological data, a search for causes should begin with how the public health system produces and reports the information before considering other causes, such as infection cycles and higher incidences of events on certain days. Our results suggest that when oscillations occur in epidemiological data, this may be a signal that there are shortcomings in the public health system generating that information.","output":"Oscillations in U.S. COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Data Reflect Diagnostic and Reporting Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whenever the retinal image changes some neurons in visual cortex increase their rate of firing, while others decrease their rate of firing. Linking specific sets of neuronal responses with perception and behavior is essential for understanding mechanisms of neural circuit computation. We trained mice of both sexes to perform visual detection tasks and used optogenetic perturbations to increase or decrease neuronal spiking primary visual cortex (V1). Perceptual reports were always enhanced by increments in V1 spike counts and impaired by decrements, even when increments and decrements in spiking were generated in the same neuronal populations. Moreover, detecting changes in cortical activity depended on spike count integration rather than instantaneous changes in spiking. Recurrent neural networks trained in the task similarly relied on increments in neuronal activity when activity has costs. This work clarifies neuronal decoding strategies employed by cerebral cortex to translate cortical spiking into percepts that can be used to guide behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVisual responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) are diverse, in that neurons can be either excited or inhibited by the onset of a visual stimulus. We selectively potentiated or suppressed V1 spiking in mice while they performed contrast change detection tasks. In other experiments, excitation or inhibition was delivered to V1 independent of visual stimuli. Mice readily detected increases in V1 spiking while equivalent reductions in V1 spiking suppress the probability of detection, even when increases and decreases in V1 spiking are generated in the same neuronal populations. Our data raise the striking possibility that only increments in spiking are used to render information to structures downstream of V1.","output":"Mice preferentially use increases in cerebral cortex spiking to detect changes in visual stimuli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In the current era of episode-based hospital reimbursements, it is important to determine the impact of hospital size on contemporary national trends in surgical technique and outcomes of lobectomy. METHODS Patients aged >18 y undergoing open and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy from 2008 to 2014 were identified using insurance claims data from the National Inpatient Sample. The impact of hospital size on surgical approach and outcomes for both open and VATS lobectomy were analyzed. RESULTS Over the 7-y period, 202,668 lobectomies were performed nationally, including 71,638 VATS and 131,030 open. Although the overall number of lobectomies decreased (30,058 in 2008 versus 27,340 in 2014, P < 0.01), the proportion of VATS lobectomies increased (24.0% versus 46.9%), and open lobectomies decreased (76.0% versus 53.0%, all P < 0.01). When stratified by hospital size, small hospitals had a significant increase in the proportion of open lobectomies (6.4%-12.2%; P = 0.01) and trend toward increased number of VATS lobectomies (2.7%-12.2%). Annual mortality rates for VATS (range: 1.0%-1.9%) and open (range: 1.9%-2.4%) lobectomy did not significantly differ over time (all P > 0.05) but did decrease among small hospitals (4.1%-1.3% and 5.1%-1.1% for VATS and open, respectively; both P < 0.05). After adjusting for confounders, hospital bed size was not a predictor of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS Utilization of VATS lobectomies has increased over time, more so among small hospitals. Mortality rates for open lobectomy remain consistently higher than VATS lobectomy (range 0.4%-1.4%) but did not significantly differ over time. This data can help benchmark hospital performance in the future.","output":"Pre-COVID-19 National Mortality Trends in Open and Video-Assisted Lobectomy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims To analyse the learning points from the first 30 days of the COVID-19 lockdown at our institution. Patients & methods Following ethical approval, data were collected prospectively on all patients admitted under orthopaedics between March 23, 2020, and April 22, 2020. This included baseline demographics (sex, age), biochemical (blood tests), radiological (chest X-ray (CXR), computed tomography (CT)), nature and mechanism of injury, comorbidities, regular medication, observations, specific respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, management, operations, time to theatre, and outcome including mortality incidence. The nature of injury and operations performed were compared to the same period of the previous year (2019). Results During the study period, 162 (74 males) patients were admitted, with a mean age of 60.7 (range 1-101, SD 2.1). On admission, 66 (41%) patients were tested for COVID, out of which eight (13.7%) patients tested positive. Subsequently, another four patients tested positive, who developed symptoms after admission. Four out 12 (33%) confirmed COVID patients died. During this period, 4/150 other patients also died of other causes (mortality incidence 2.6%). The average ages of COVID non-survivors vs survivors were 88, SD 1, vs 76, SD 12, respectively; 2/4 had concurrent diabetes and cancer, another cancer alone, and another complex autoimmune disease managed by immunosuppressive medication. Overall admissions significantly reduced by almost 50% compared with the previous year (162 vs 373, p=<0.05), including cases of polytrauma (15 vs 33). Time to surgery was increased by an average of one day, mainly due to time taken for COVID-19 swab results to come back, and in positive patients, this was an average of 2.75 days (0-13). Lymphopenia was a useful biomarker of COVID, with levels significantly different between groups (p=<0.05). Of the clinical symptoms assessed, 8/12 patients experienced positive chest symptoms or pyrexia but only four had positive CXR changes. Discussion & lessons learnt Eight out of 12 patients who contracted COVID-19 survived without needing intensive care. Non-survivors were older with significant comorbidities. Lymphopenia is a good biomarker of the disease, but suspicious CXR was not sensitive for excluding it. Trauma volume reduced. We have highlighted significant changes to expect should there be a second wave of the virus. Key lessons learnt were that reduction in trauma volume and cessation of elective operating allowed for redeployment, including taking over the minor injury unit; more senior, consultant decision-makers at the front door reduced unnecessary admissions. Increased use of conservative practice was effective at reducing operations required. Expedited COVID swab test processing allowed early de-escalation of isolation, reducing time to surgery. We expect approximately 12% of the typical orthopaedic population to be admitted with COVID, and up to 33% of these patients to die within 28 days of contracting the virus. The vast majority of patients, however, can be managed appropriately with ward-level care. An early decision on escalation and resuscitation status in the emergency department improves patient flow significantly. Remote working was effective and could be extended in the future. We have highlighted the significant changes to expect should there be a second wave of the virus and effective solutions for managing the problems that arise, which could be useful for other units.","output":"COVID-19: The First 30 Days at a UK Level 1 Trauma Centre and Lessons Learnt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Metagenomic studies have revealed the presence of a filarial nematode in Ixodes scapularis. The phylogeny of this agent, and its potential for human infection, are unknown. METHODS: We used existing metagenomic data from I. scapularis to determine the phylogeny of this tick-associated nematode and employed quantitative PCR to determine if the presence of this agent had an effect on the burden of Borrelia burgdorferi. We also developed a Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System assay using the Av33 antigen as a target to investigate the presence of antibodies against this nematode in 128 serum specimens from patients with Lyme disease and babesiosis. To demonstrate assay utility, we used 15 sera from patients with onchocerciasis as controls. RESULTS: We show that this agent is a new species in the genus Monanema and its presence in vector ticks does not impact the burden of B. burgdorferi. We did not detect IgG antibodies to this agent in 127 of 128 sera from patients with Lyme disease or babesiosis. One sample had reactivity above the threshold, but at the low-level equivalent to the least reactive onchocerciasis sera. This low positive signal could be a result of cross-reacting antibodies, antibodies from a previous infection with a filarial nematode, or, less likely, a exposure to the Ixodes scapularis-associated nematode.

After infecting the host cells, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause a hyperinflammatory reaction through the excessive release of cytokines, a condition known as cytokine storm, while inducing lymphopenia and a disrupted immune response. Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and immune dysregulation, but the exact mechanisms through which it exacerbates COVID-19 infection are not fully clarified. The production of increased amounts of cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) lead to oxidative stress and defective function of innate and adaptive immunity, whereas the activation of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome seems to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the infection. Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness could favor the recently discovered infection of the endothelium by SARS-CoV-2, whereas alterations in cardiac structure and function and the prothrombotic microenvironment in obesity could provide a link for the increased cardiovascular events in these patients. The successful use of anti-inflammatory agents such as IL-1 and IL-6 blockers in similar hyperinflammatory settings, like that of rheumatoid arthritis, has triggered the discussion of whether such agents could be administrated in selected patients with COVID-19 disease.","output":"Obesity and COVID-19: immune and metabolic derangement as a possible link to adverse clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mask wearing has been shown to be an effective strategy for slowing the spread of COVID-19.

Indirect immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that all mAbs recognized cells transfected with an NS7 expression construct or infected with PDCoV. Western blot showed that NS7-specific mAbs recognized an additional protein band of about 12 kDa from PDCoV-infected cell lysates but not from cells with the ectopic expression of NS7. Detailed analysis suggested that this additional protein band represented a novel accessory protein, termed NS7a, a 100 amino acid polypeptide identical to the 3 end of NS7. Moreover, NS7a is encoded by a separate subgenomic mRNA with a non-canonical transcription regulatory sequence.

While, for the former reliable data are available (in the form of number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision-makers to plan ahead (e.g., medical structures and equipment). Previous work of one of the authors shows that an alternative formulation of the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), i.e., the proportion of the number of persons tested positive in a given day, exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospitals and intensive care units. In this paper, we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA). The rigorous analytical framework chosen, i.e., the stochastic processes theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead of those quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision-makers to forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.","output":"Predictive Capacity of COVID-19 Test Positivity Rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2 m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70-79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown on Characteristics of Autopsy Cases in Greece.

Despite requiring mask usage and other mitigation measures for students, staff, and faculty, a large university experienced a rapid increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases within the two weeks of opening in August 2020. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of mask usage at the university. METHODS: For seven weeks during October 5-November 22, eight trained observers conducted weekly observations of mask usage at two sites per week. A total of 18 on-campus and 4 near-campus locations served as observation sites, including student centers, libraries, classroom buildings, dormitories, student dining, transportation sites, nearcampus apartment buildings, a grocery store, and a football stadium. An observation period lasted until 40 observations per site were made or one hour elapsed, whichever occurred first. Observations occurred at different times on multiple days of the week from a fixed location at each site. Observers monitored mask usage of either every 3rd or every 10th person depending upon person-density, selecting only one sampling strategy per observation period. For each observed person, observers recorded whether a mask was worn, and for those wearing masks, if the mask was worn correctly (i.e., mouth and nose covered) and type of mask worn (i.e., cloth, surgical, N-95-type, gaiter, other). Percentage of persons wearing masks and percentage wearing masks correctly was calculated and communicated weekly to the university. RESULTS: The study included a total of 3,144 observations (mean = 449 per week [range: 389-510]). The mean weekly percentage of persons wearing masks was 83.9% (range = 79.6%-88.3%). Among the 2,637 people observed wearing masks, the mean weekly percentage wearing them correctly was 86.0% (range = 84.0% to 90.4%). The mean weekly percentage wearing masks varied by site type and ranged from 78.7% at transportation sites to 91.0% at library sites. Mask types observed were cloth (62.4%), surgical (30.5%), neck gaiter (5.8%), and N-95-type (1.1%). CONCLUSION: Approximately 7 in 10 persons observed were wearing a mask and wearing it correctly. Observed persons most often wore cloth masks and observed mask usage varied by site type. Conducting observational studies using standardized methodology can provide rapid information about mask wearing in a population. Such information can inform additional efforts at a university that experienced a COVID-19 outbreak to help improve compliance with correct mask wearing, one effective mitigation strategy against SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"To wear, or not to wear, that is the question: Observing mask usage at a university during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a phenomenon that has emerged during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Specifically, utilizing a language model that has been finetuned on recognizing partisanship of the news articles, we represent the ideology of a news corpus on a topic by corpus-contextualized topic embedding and measure the polarization using cosine distance. We apply our method to a dataset of news articles about the COVID-19 pandemic. Extensive experiments on different news sources and topics demonstrate the efficacy of our method to capture topical polarization, as indicated by its effectiveness of retrieving the most polarized topics.","output":"Detecting Polarized Topics Using Partisanship-aware Contextualized Topic Embeddings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeted therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 virus caused COVID-19 are in urgent need. Cinobufacini has been reported to have broad-spectrum antiviral effects and widely used in Southeast Asian countries. This study aims to assess the efficacy of Cinobufacini injection in treating patients with severe COVID-19. A randomized preliminary clinical trial was conducted and eligible patients were allocated to receive general treatment plus Cinobufacini injection or only general treatment as control for 7 days. The primary outcomes of the oxygenation index PaO2/FiO2 and ROX, secondary outcomes of white blood cell count, respiratory support step-down time (RSST), safety indicators, etc were monitored. After 7 days of treatment, the oxygenation index was improved in 95.2% patients in the treatment group compared with 68.4% in the control group. The PaO2/FiO2 and ROX indices in the treatment group (mean, 226.2767.35 and 14.013.99 respectively) were significantly higher than the control group (mean, 143.2351.29 and 9.645.54 respectively). The RSST was 1 day shorter in the treatment group. Multivariate regression analysis suggested that Cinobufacini injection contributed the most to the outcome of PaO2/FiO2.

The postexposure antibody therapies to prevent EBOV infection are considered efficient. However, due to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibody, their application in the tropics has been limited. Here, we developed a thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability, which retained their neutralizing activity at 25C for one year, in contrast to conventional polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). We immunized laying hens with a variety of EBOV vaccine candidates and confirmed that VSV  G/EBOVGP encoding the EBOV glycoprotein could induce high titer neutralizing antibodies against EBOV. The therapeutic efficacy of immune IgY antibodies in vivo was evaluated in the newborn Balb/c mice model. Lethal dose of virus challenged mice were treated 2 or 24 h post-infection with different doses of anti-EBOV IgY. The group receiving a high dose of 106 NAU/kg (neutralizing antibody units/kilogram) achieved complete protection with no signs of disease, while the low-dose group was only partially protected. In contrast, all mice receiving na?ve IgY died within 10 days. In conclusion, the anti-EBOV IgY exhibits excellent thermostability and protective efficacy, and it is very promising to be developed as alternative therapeutic entities. Author Summary Although several Ebola virus therapeutic antibodies have been reported in recent years, however, due to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibody, their application in tropical endemic areas has been limited. We developed a highly thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY).

The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 genes) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target genes in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC/L for N2.

Some asymptomatic patients with early-stage lung cancer who have COVID-19 receive surgical treatment but develop severe pneumonia and other complications or even experience postoperative death, and they may have a worse prognosis compared with healthy individuals infected with COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the incidence and prognosis of COVID-19 in lung cancer patients and provide evidence-based medical support for clinical treatment. METHODS: We will search 6 medical databases to identify eligible studies published from the establishment of the database to the present. The quality of the included literature will be evaluated using the bias risk assessment tool in Cochrane 5.1.0, and a meta-analysis will be performed using Stata 14.0. Heterogeneity will be statistically assessed using &#967;2 tests. RESULTS: The study will integrate existing research findings to investigate the prevalence and severity rate of patients with lung cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the prognosis and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with or without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence to support whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer and provide guidance for clinical prevention and treatment based on the evidence obtained in light of the unpredictable threat posed by COVID-19.

A total of 850 adolescents from three Chinese secondary schools participated in the survey during the pandemic outbreak, and the data were analyzed by hierarchical linear regression. The results show that COVID-19-related stressors were a vulnerability factor in predicting adjustment. Adolescents' adjustment could be attributed to both individual-level (e.g., coping) and class-level (e.g., a class-level indicator of coping) characteristics. Specifically, problem-based coping and online learning satisfaction can promote adolescents' adjustment directly or serve as a buffer against the negative impact of stressors on adjustment, while emotion-based coping is a vulnerability factor in predicting adjustment directly or as a risk factor in strengthening the relation between stressors and adjustment. Compared with male adolescents and adolescents with high socio-economic status, female and impoverished adolescents reported poorer adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings enrich our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' adjustment and are helpful in improving adolescents' adjustment during the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19-Related Stressors and Chinese Adolescents' Adjustment: The Moderating Role of Coping and Online Learning Satisfaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NATCHA Abstract: The unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 necessitated the promotion of better hygiene practices to curb the spread of the virus. Better hygiene requires that households have a stable supply of water. However, little is known about the predictors of changes in water use in emergency situations such as COVID-19 in Uganda. This study uses data from a cross-sectional survey to examine the changes in the quantities of water used by 1,639 Ugandan households due to COVID-19. This article also explores the factors that are associated with changes in water use. The month March 2020 is used in this study as a cut-off because this is the month in which the government implemented a lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Results indicate that most households had an increase in the quantity of water used after March 2020 when compared with the period before March 2020. Household characteristics that were associated with a change in the quantity of water used were age, sex, education, main occupation of household head, household size and region of residence.

Materials and Methods: The study was initiated by the ESTRO Radiation Oncology Safety and Quality Committee (ROSQC). A survey consisting of multiple choice, open ended and Likert scale questions was created to analyse the extent of changes embedded in RT practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic under the four domains: patient care, RTT workflow, remote working and RT practice. This online survey was distributed globally in May 2020. Results: 229 respondents across 27 countries completed the survey. 60% of respondents reported continuing/commencing RT in COVID-19 patients. Routine testing of patients and RTTs was not common. Split teams' procedures, hot linacs and separate entrances were implemented by 50% of respondents. Remote working was implemented for RT team members where face to face patient contact was not essential. Lack of staff, connectivity issues and lack of confirmed positive cases in the department were the main reasons cited for not implementing recommended measures. Conclusion: It is suggested that RT departments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and implemented certain changes in RT practice.

Recent pieces of evidence have marked events of neuro infection and neuroinvasion, producing several neurological complications in COVID-19 patients; however, a systematic understanding of neuro-pathophysiology and manifested neurological complications, more specifically in elderly COVID-19 patients is largely elusive. Since the elderly population gradually develops neurological disorders with aging, COVID-19 inevitably poses a higher risk of neurological manifestations to the aged patients. In this report, we reviewed SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in neurological manifestations with an emphasis on the elderly population. We reviewed neuropathological events including neuroinfection, neuroinvasion, and their underlying mechanisms affecting neuromuscular, central- and peripheral- nervous systems. We further assessed the imminent neurological challenges in the COVID-19 exposed population, post-SARS-CoV-2-infection. Given the present state of clinical preparedness, the emerging role of AI and machine learning was also discussed concerning COVID-19 diagnostics and its management.

COVID-19 has had greatest impact on minoritized and vulnerable communities. Decreases in traumatic events may not extend to these communities given pandemic-related socioeconomic and psychological burdens that increase risk of exposure to trauma and violence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study (N=1634) of all trauma activations presenting to our institution (January 1-May 31,2020) and same time periods in 2018 and 2019. Census tracts and associated Social Vulnerability Index quartiles were determined from patient addresses. Changes in trauma activations pre- and post-Massachusetts state-of-emergency declaration compared to a historical control were analyzed using difference-in-differences methodology. RESULTS: Weekly all-cause trauma activations fell from 26.44 to 8.25 (rate ratio=0.36[0.26,0.50]) post-declaration, with significant difference-in-differences compared to historical control (p<0.0001). Non-violent trauma activations significantly decreased from 21.11 to 5.17 after the declaration (rate ratio=0.27[0.37,0.91] p<0.0001) while there was no significant decrease in violent injury (5.33 to 3.08 [rate ratio=0.69 [0.39,1.22] p=0.20). Stratified by vulnerability, the most vulnerable quartile had an increased proportion of all-cause trauma post-declaration and had no decrease in violent trauma activations following the declaration compared to historical control (rate ratio=0.84[0.38-1.86] p=0.67). CONCLUSION: The state-of-emergency declaration was associated with significant decreases in overall trauma; to a greater extent in non-violent injuries. Among those living in the most socially vulnerable communities, there was no decrease in violent trauma. These findings highlight the need for violence and injury prevention programs in vulnerable communities, particularly in times of crisis.","output":"Social Vulnerability and COVID-19: Changes in Trauma Activations at a Safety-Net Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of cardiac implantable electronic devices after death has become a source of controversy.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that can occur in severe cases with acute pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. In these cases, ICU admission is necessary. CASE SUMMARY A 59-year-old Caucasian man with septic shock and bilateral interstitial pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 and schizotypal personality disorder presented with catatonic behaviour manifested by soporous state, response to intense painful stimuli with opening of the eyes, execution of simple verbal commands, maintenance of the same position, catalepsy, immobility, rigidity and mutism. At the same time, there were symptoms of septic shock and catatonic symptoms causing greater difficulty in the correct formulation of the diagnosis. During the course of his hospitalization, he was treated with asenapine 20 mg/day. The catatonia responded rapidly and significantly to the asenapine. DISCUSSION To date, the pathophysiology of catatonia is unclear and few guidelines are available for the treatment of catatonia. In the literature, studies have reported the efficacy of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam, GABAA agonists such as zolpidem, NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine, antidepressant SSRIs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine and antipsychotics such as olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole. We demonstrate that the antipsychotic asenapine is also effective in treating catatonic symptoms in psychiatric disorders.

This study was conducted in partnership with International Care Ministries (ICM), a Philippine-based non-governmental organization that runs the \\"Transform\\" poverty alleviation program. The main objective of this study was to describe the changes in COVID-19 KAPs among households experiencing extreme poverty in the Philippines over an 8-month period. Methods A KAP questionnaire was integrated into the household survey collected as part of ICM's regular monitoring and evaluation of \\"Transform\\". Data collection for the first survey was conducted between February 20 and March 13, 2020, and the second survey was conducted between November 12 and December 12, 2020. Frequencies and proportions were calculated to describe the respondents' responses and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess if there were significant differences in KAP identification between the two time points. Results We observed a distinct increase across all KAP domains. Over 90% of study participants were able to correctly identify COVID-19 transmission modes and preventive measures, and an even higher percentage reported adopting these measures. However, the intention to seek care from public hospitals for COVID-19 symptoms dropped from 43.6% to 28.4%, while reports of self-treatment using stored medicines or antibiotics increased. Trust in community members and local health authorities was correlated with higher knowledge and practice scores. Conclusions Our study results reflect the extraordinary speed of information dissemination and behaviour change globally over the course of the pandemic, but they also highlight the changes in KAP that show the additional challenges faced by populations experiencing poverty in the Philippines.

We find that the emergence of rooftop PV technology in Indonesia has provoked resistance, as it challenges the incumbent power companys monopoly over urban space, the Java-Bali grid systems dependency on coal-based electricity, and state-led practices that prioritise the implementation of small-scale solar in rural and remote areas. We argue that paying attention to the asymmetric power relations among institutions and actors across multiple scales offers a more-fine grained approach to analysing the dynamics of sustainability transitions. Our findings also call for greater attention to diverse and divergent perspectives among niche actors, emphasising the need to genuinely embrace local voices and knowledge that might otherwise be marginalised by the dominant globally and nationally driven narratives of renewable transition.","output":"Battle over the sun: Resistance, tension, and divergence in enabling rooftop solar adoption in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Southern hemisphere, Runion Island acts as a sentinel for infections preferentially occurring during the austral winter that are likely to reach the Northern hemisphere a few months later.

Demographic, clinical, and biological data as well as given medications and outcome were prospectively collected among all PCR-confirmed influenza-infected patients. In 2009 and 2010, 25 patients met the criteria. Patients median age was 40.4 (17.4) years. Most of them (22/25) had comorbidities such as: chronic diseases, overweight, obesity, pregnancy, and Down syndrome. Maximum bed-occupation rate was 10 days per million inhabitants.

One of the measures taken by the Malaysian government, namely the Movement Control Order, has been carried out since March 18, 2020. In order to provide precise information to the government so that it can take the appropriate measures, many researchers have attempted to predict and create the model for these cases to identify the number of cases each day and the peak of this pandemic. Therefore, hospitals and health workers can anticipate a surge in COVID19 patients. In this research, confirmed, recovered, and death cases prediction was performed using the neural network as one of the machine learning methods with high accuracy.

Trial registries were searched across the same period for ongoing and completed (but not published) RCTs. Definitions of ileus and outcome measures describing the return of bowel function were extracted. Results Of 5670 manuscripts screened, 215 (reporting 217 RCTs) were eligible. Most RCTs involved patients undergoing colorectal surgery (161 of 217, 742 per cent). A total of 784 outcomes were identified across all published RCTs, comprising 73 measures (clinical: 63, 86 per cent; radiological: 6, 8 per cent; physiological: 4, 5 per cent). The most commonly reported outcome measure was 'time to first passage of flatus' (140 of 217, 645 per cent). The outcomes 'ileus' and 'prolonged ileus' were defined infrequently and variably. Conclusion Outcome reporting for the return of bowel function after gastrointestinal surgery is variable and not fit for purpose. An agreed core outcome set will improve the consistency, reliability and clinical value of future studies.","output":"Systematic review of definitions and outcome measures for return of bowel function after gastrointestinal surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research points to the health benefits of rehabilitation in urban green spaces.

This is the first report on the development of an RT-LAMP assay for the detection of NoV genomes. Because of the diversity of NoV genotypes, we used 9 and 13 specially designed primers containing mixed bases for genogroup I (GI) and II (GII), respectively. The RT-LAMP assay had the advantages of rapidity, simplicity, specificity, and selectively and could obtain results within 90 min, generally even within 60 min, under isothermal conditions at 62 degrees C. The detection limits for NoV genomes were between 10(2) and 10(3) copies/tube for GI and GII with differentiation by genotype, and no cross-reactions among NoV GI and GII and other gastroenteritis viruses, such as sapovirus, human astrovirus, adenovirus type 40 and 41, and group A and C rotavirus, were found. In the evaluation tests with fecal specimens obtained from gastroenteritis outbreaks, the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay with regard to RT-PCR were 100 and 94% for GI and 100 and 100% for GII, respectively. These findings establish that the RT-LAMP assay is potentially useful for the rapid detection of NoV genomes from fecal specimens in outbreaks of food-borne and person-to-person-transmitted gastroenteritis.","output":"Rapid detection of norovirus from fecal specimens by real-time reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has currently attracted increasing attention due to its potential function in regulating energy homeostasis, other than the actions on cellular growth, blood pressure, fluid, and electrolyte balance. The existence of RAS is well established in metabolic organs, including pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, where activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) - angiotensin II pathway contributes to the impairment of insulin secretion, glucose transport, fat distribution, and adipokines production. However, the activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - angiotensin (1-7) pathway, a novel branch of the RAS, plays an opposite role in the ACE pathway, which could reverse these consequences by improving local microcirculation, inflammation, stress state, structure remolding, and insulin signaling pathway. In addition, new studies indicate the protective RAS arm possesses extraordinary ability to enhance brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity and induces browning of white adipose tissue, and consequently, it leads to increased energy expenditure in the form of heat instead of ATP synthesis. Interestingly, ACE2 is the receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is threating public health worldwide. The main complications of SARS-CoV-2 infected death patients include many energy metabolism-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes. The specific mechanism leading to this phenomenon is largely unknown.

Although effective vaccines against the disease have been developed, there are still points to be clarified about the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of COVID-19. In this study, we determined the binding energies and the bond types of complexes formed by open (6VYB) and closed (6VXX) forms of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and wild and mutant forms of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 proteins using the molecular docking approach. First, all missense SNPs were found in the NCBI Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) for IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 and analyzed with SIFT, PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, SNAP2, Mutation Assessor, and PANTHER cSNP web-based tools to determine their pathogenicity. When at least four of these analysis tools showed that the SNP had a pathogenic effect on the protein product, this SNP was saved for further analysis. Delta delta G (DDG) and protein stability analysis for amino acid changes were performed in the web-based tools I-Mutant, MUpro, and SAAFEC-SEQ. The structural effect of amino acid change on the protein product was made using the HOPE web-based tool. HawkDock server was used for molecular docking and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) analysis and binding energies of all complexes were calculated. BIOVIA Discovery Studio program was utilized to visualize the complexes. Hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and non-bonded contacts between Spike and IFITM protein chains in the complexes were detected with the PDBsum web-based tool. The best binding energy among the 6VYB-IFITM wild protein complexes belong to 6VYB-IFITM1 (-46.16 kcal/mol). Likewise, among the 6VXX-IFITM wild protein complexes, the most negative binding energy belongs to 6VXX-IFITM1 (-52.42 kcal/mol). An interesting result found in the study is the presence of hydrogen bonds between the cytoplasmic domain of the IFITM1 wild protein and the S2 domain of 6VYB. Among the Spike-IFITM mutant protein complexes, the best binding energy belongs to the 6VXX-IFITM2 N63S complex (-50.77 kcal/mol) and the worst binding energy belongs to the 6VXX-IFITM3 S50T complex (4.86 kcal/mol).

Because of concerns for resource utilization and surges in hospital capacity use, Texas Executive Order GA-29 required statewide mask wear beginning July 3, 2020. Our objective was to compare COVID-19 case load, hospital bed use, and deaths before and after implementation of this mask order. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using publicly reported statewide data to perform a mixed-methods interrupted time series analysis. We compared outcomes before and after the statewide mask wear mandate per Executive Order GA-29. The preorder period was from June 19 to July 2, 2020. The postorder period was July 17 to September 17, 2020. Outcomes included daily COVID-19 case load, hospitalizations, and mortality. RESULTS: The daily case load before the mask order per 100,000 individuals was 187.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 157.0C217.0) versus 200.7 (95% CI 179.8C221.6) after GA-29. The number of daily hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 171.4 (95% CI 143.8C199.0) before GA-29 versus 225.1 (95% CI 202.9C247.3) after. Daily mortality was 2.4 (95% CI 1.9C2.9) before GA-29 versus 5.2 (95% CI 4.6C5.8). There was no material impact on our results after controlling for economic activity. CONCLUSIONS: In both adjusted and unadjusted analyses, we were unable to detect a reduction in case load, hospitalization rates, or mortality associated with the implementation of an executive order requiring a statewide mask order. These results suggest that during a period of rapid virus spread, additional public health measures may be necessary to mitigate transmission at the population level.","output":"Analysis of the Effects of a Texas State-Wide Mask Mandate (Executive Order GA-29) on Case Load, Hospitalizations, and Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The purpose of this review is to summarize the utilization and most recent developments with regard to the use of ultrasound when imaging the abdomen and gastrointestinal tract. RECENT FINDINGS Although the use of ultrasound to assess the anatomy of the various abdominal organs is well established within radiology and critical care, its use as part of functional and physiological assessment is still evolving. Recent developments have extended the use of ultrasound beyond standard B-mode/2D imaging techniques to incorporate more functional and haemodynamic assessment. These include the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), elastography, and colour Doppler techniques. SUMMARY Whilst Doppler techniques are reasonably well established within critical care ultrasound (CCUS), especially in echocardiography, CEUS and elastography are less well known. CEUS utilizes a purely intravascular contrast agent whilst elastography measures the degree of deformation or stiffness in various organs. Whilst their use individually may be limited; they may play a role in a multiparametric assessment. Mirroring the overall trends in critical care ultrasound development, abdominal ultrasound assessment is best integrated in a holistic approach and adapted to the individual patient.","output":"Future developments in the imaging of the gastrointestinal tract: the role of ultrasound."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information regarding the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in asymptomatic carriers is scarce. In order to determine the duration of infectivity and its correlation with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results and time since initial positive PCR test in this population, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity in nasopharyngeal samples longitudinally obtained from asymptomatic carriers who disembarked from a cruise ship during a COVID-19 outbreak. Of 166 nasopharyngeal samples collected from 39 asymptomatic carriers every 48 h until two consecutive negative PCR test results were obtained, SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from 9 PCR-positive samples which were obtained from 7 persons (18%; 7/39). Viable viruses were isolated predominantly within 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, except for one person who shed viable virus until day 15. The median crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR of culture-positive samples was 24.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.4 to 25.8; range, 17.9 to 30.3), and Cp values were significantly associated with isolation of viable virus (odds ratio, 0.496; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.329 to 0.747; P value, 0.001), which was consistent with existing data for symptomatic patients. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples consecutively obtained from a person who shed viable virus for 15 days identified the emergence of two novel single nucleotide variants (C8626T transition and C18452T transition) in the sample collected on day 15, with the latter corresponding to an amino acid substitution in nonstructural protein 14. The impact of these mutations on prolonged viable-virus shedding is unclear. These findings underscore the potential role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission.IMPORTANCE A growing number of studies suggest the potential role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers as a major driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, virological assessment of asymptomatic infection has largely been limited to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which can be persistently positive without necessarily indicating the presence of viable virus (e.g., replication-competent virus). Here, we evaluated the infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers by detecting SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects on Vero cells using longitudinally obtained nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic carriers. We show that asymptomatic carriers can shed viable virus until 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, with one outlier shedding until day 15. The crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR was the leading predictive factor for virus viability. These findings provide additional insights into the role of asymptomatic carriers as a source of transmission and highlight the importance of universal source control measures, along with isolation policy for asymptomatic carriers.","output":"Shedding of Viable Virus in Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Carriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable tool in anesthesiology used for evaluating and managing cardiopulmonary pathology. Implications of this modality are extensive. Seamless integration into advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) has potential to improve resuscitation outcomes, and there is growing impetus for its implementation during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. However, it remains underutilized largely due to limited training. We use high-fidelity simulation and a novel 4W approach (when to apply POCUS, where to place the ultrasound probe, what images mean, what to do next) to incorporate this technique into resuscitation training. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel 4W POCUS approach for training anesthesiology residents in the setting of resuscitation. Methods Our approach teaches learners when and where to implement POCUS, how to interpret their findings, and how to apply these findings in a clinical setting.

It is mainly transmitted by close-contact inhalation of aerosolized viral particles. The risk of nosocomial spread of B19V in the transplantation ward is quite high. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of routine disinfection and the effectiveness of isolation measures in the wards of B19V-infected kidney transplant recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Throat swab samples of 19 kidney transplant recipients admitted to the isolation ward and three healthcare workers (HCWs) were collected for viral DNA detection. Routine disinfection procedures were performed twice a day in general and B19V isolation wards. Environmental surface and air samples were collected for viral DNA detection before and after disinfection. RESULTS: A total of four patients were diagnosed with B19V infection and transferred to the B19V isolation ward, of which only two had positive throat swab samples. The other 15 patients and all HCWs tested negative for B19V. A total of 88 environmental surface and air samples were collected. Eight of the environmental samples collected in the B19V isolation ward before disinfection tested positive for B19V, while one sample tested positive after disinfection. In the general wards, all environmental samples collected before disinfection tested negative for B19V. All 24 samples collected from ambient air, whether in B19V isolation or general wards, before or after disinfection, tested negative for B19V. CONCLUSION: Existing methods of routine or terminal disinfection for air and object surfaces were effective in eliminating B19V from object surfaces and ambient air in the isolation and general wards. Material surfaces that are exposed to high frequency and easily contaminated by blood, body fluids, and indoor air were the focus of cleaning and disinfection.

The main eligibility criteria were pneumonia, a blood lymphocyte cell count of 800 per L (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001) or lower, and no comorbidities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was confirmed with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Exposures: Usual care alone, or usual care plus 3 doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 5 g/kg, subcutaneously at days 0-2). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the time from randomization to improvement of at least 1 point on a 7-category disease severity score. Results: Of 200 participants, 112 (56%) were men and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 45 (40-55) years. There was random assignment of 100 patients (50%) to the rhG-CSF group and 100 (50%) to the usual care group. Time to clinical improvement was similar between groups (rhG-CSF group median of 12 days (IQR, 10-16 days) vs usual care group median of 13 days (IQR, 11-17 days); hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.95-1.71; P = .06). For secondary end points, the proportion of patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock was lower in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group, 2% vs usual care group, 15%; difference, -13%; 95%CI, -21.4% to -5.4%). At 21 days, 2 patients (2%) had died in the rhG-CSF group compared with 10 patients (10%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04-0.88). At day 5, the lymphocyte cell count was higher in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group median of 1050/L vs usual care group median of 620/L; Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the difference in medians, 440; 95% CI, 380-490). Serious adverse events, such as sepsis or septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, occurred in 29 patients (14.5%) in the rhG-CSF group and 42 patients (21%) in the usual care group. Conclusion and Relevance: In preliminary findings from a randomized clinical trial, rhG-CSF treatment for patients with COVID-19 with lymphopenia but no comorbidities did not accelerate clinical improvement, but the number of patients developing critical illness or dying may have been reduced.

Mucormycosis being a rapidly progressive and fulminant fungal infection required surgical debridement of necrotic tissue on emergency basis. The fatal combination of immunocompromised status, multisystemic involvement, and difficult airway in these patients pose numerous new challenges regarding anesthetic management. The present study was conducted to outline major concerns and the anesthetic management of patients undergoing surgical resection for rhinoorbital mucormycosis (ROM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in our institute for a duration of 2 months (June and July 2021). The data of all the cases posted for ROM was collected from the ENT and Anesthesia record register. Total 70 patients presented with mucormycosis, for surgical debridement out of which 25 patients were posted for surgery under general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, duration of COVID illness, treatment taken during COVID (oxygen therapy/steroid intake), hemodynamic parameters, monitoring methods, and surgical procedures were recorded for each patient. STATISTICAL EVALUATION: SPSS version 21.0 was used for data analysis. Mean and SD were used to analyze the difference in mean values, and independent Student's t-test were utilized to compare the quantitative variables. Frequency distribution and percentage were used for qualitative parameters. Significant difference was accepted at P  0.05 with 95% CI (confidence interval) in the study. RESULTS: Demographic data were comparable with respect to age, gender distribution, and ASA status. Mean duration of Covid illness was (12.18  3.68) days. The mean HbA1C measured was (10.8  1.42). Strong correlation was found between steroid intake and raised HbA1c in all patients (r = 0.77).

METHODS: This cross-sectional mixed-method study was conducted between October 2019 and May 2020. Two provinces, one rich and one poor, were randomly selected and then a city and rural district from each province were randomly selected. From these 4 sites in the 2 provinces, all 56 PHC centres responded to a self-administrative questionnaire survey on their capacities and practices related to NCDs. A total of 79 participants from Provincial and District Health Offices, provincial and district hospitals, and PHC centres who are involved with NCDs participated in focus group discussions or in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Strong health infrastructure, competent staff (however not with increased workload), essential medicines and secured budget boost PHC capacity to address NCDs prevention, control, case management, referral and rehabilitation. Community engagement through village health volunteers improves NCDs awareness, supports enrolment in screening and raises adherence to interventions. Village health volunteers, the crucial link between the health system and the community, are key in supporting health promotion and NCDs prevention and control. Collaboration between provincial and district hospitals in providing resources and technical support enhance the capacity of PHC centres to provide NCDs services. However, inconsistent national policy directions and uncertainty related to key performance indicators hamper progress in NCDs management at the operational level. The dynamic of urbanization and socialization, especially living in obesogenic environments, is one of the greatest challenges for dealing with NCDs.

Given the clustering nature of the epidemic, focusing on the areas with high concentration of severe illness and deaths allows us to capture the true impact of COVID-19 on mortality and life expectancy, which are likely to be underestimated in the national level data. We find that on the period 1 Jan to 4 April 2020, seasonal life expectancy in Bergamo reduced by around 8.1 and 6.5 years compared to 2019 for men and women respectively (4.5 and 3.4 years in Brescia). The drop in period life expectancy for 2020 may total up to 3 years in the case of men and 2 years in the case of women. Such a sharp decrease in life expectancy has not been experienced in modern history since the Second World War. This study shows that, in the absence of public health interventions to reduce the spread of the virus, COVID-19 has set life expectancy in Bergamo and Brescia back to the Italian life expectancy of 15 years ago.","output":"News from the front: Excess mortality and life expectancy in two major epicentres of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the case of a young female patient admitted to our emergency department during the Italian COVID-19 epidemic, for fever and dry cough associated with symptoms of gastric reflux over the previous 5 days.

Meat inspection procedures, established more than a hundred years ago to detect prevailing food safety issues of the time and largely harmonized around the world, do not effectively detect modern hazards and may inadvertently increase food safety risks by spreading contamination across carcasses. Visual-only inspection (VOI) is a modernized meat inspection system that is data-driven and minimizes physical manipulation of the carcass during inspection. It was developed based on scientific evidence and risk assessment and aims to better control current food safety hazards. In 2014, the European Union (EU) became the first supranational government in the world to require VOI for all swine herds slaughtered in Member States that met certain epidemiologic and animal rearing conditions. Here, we review the implementation of this new inspection system with the goal of informing similar modernization efforts in other countries and for other commodities beyond pork. This article reports the results of a literature review and interviews conducted with nine experts in 2018 on the implementation of the EU's 2014 VOI regulation. Challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned about the implementation of the regulation are described for audiences interested in adapting inspection procedures to prevent and detect modern food safety hazards. Overall, implementation of VOI varies within and across Member States, and among slaughterhouses of different sizes. This variation is due to disease risk patterns, supply chain conditions, and trade barriers. Before transitioning to a similar risk-based inspection system, other countries should consider science-based research agendas to identify what information best predicts herd health and foodborne hazards, regulatory system design that reflects local hazards, and development of targeted VOI educational materials.","output":"Implementation of visual-only swine inspection in the European Union: challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on the protocol adopted by the Oncological Home Care Service of the Tuscany Cancer Association during the CoViD-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to develop and validate a multimodal screening tool that aids in predicting the disease confirmation in emergency situations and patients with OHCA during a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter observational study of adult patients with OHCA in Daegu, Korea. To identify the potential predictors that could be used in screening tools in the emergency department, we applied logistic regression to data collected from March 1 to March 14. The prediction performance of the screening variables was then assessed and validated on the data of patients with OHCA who were treated between February 19 and March 31, 2020. General patient characteristics and hematological findings of the COVID-19-negative and COVID-19-positive groups were compared. We also evaluated confirmation test criteria as predictors for COVID-19 positivity in patients with OHCA. RESULTS: Advanced age, body temperature, and abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) revealed significant predictive ability in the derivation cohort. Of the 184 adult patients with OHCA identified in the validation cohort, 80 patients were included in the analysis. Notably, 9 patients were positive and 71 were negative on the COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Five patients (55.6%) in the COVID-19-positive group had a fever before OHCA, and 12 (16.9%) of the COVID-19-negative group had a fever before OHCA (P = 0.018). Eight patients (88.9%) in the COVID-19-positive group had a CXR indicating pneumonic infiltration. Of the criteria for predicting COVID-19, fever or an abnormal CXR had a sensitivity of 100% (65.4 - 100) and a specificity of 22.5% (13.5 - 34.0). CONCLUSION: The screening tools that combined fever or abnormal CXR had a good discriminatory ability for COVID-19 infection in adult patients with OHCA.

These symptoms have mainly been assessed in single-task setting, which might not represent activities of daily living accurately. Therefore, a dual-task protocol, consisting of the simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor tasks, was developed. This protocol assesses cognitive and motor performance in general, as well as cognitive-motor interference in specific. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The motor component of the 2BALANCE protocol consists of a static and dynamic postural task. These motor tasks are combined with different cognitive tasks assessing visuospatial cognition, processing speed, working memory and response inhibition. First, test-retest reliability will be assessed with an interval of 2 weeks in a group of young adults. Second, the 2BALANCE protocol will be validated in persons with bilateral vestibulopathy. Finally, the protocol will be implemented in persons with unilateral vestibular loss. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 2BALANCE project aims to elucidate the impact of vestibular dysfunction on cognitive and motor performance in dual-task setting. This protocol represents everyday situations better than single-task protocols, as dual-tasks such as reading street signs while walking are often encountered during daily activities. Ultimately, this project could enable individualised and holistic clinical care in these patients, taking into account single as well as dual-task performance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The current study was approved by the ethics committee of Ghent University Hospital on 5 July 2019 with registration number B670201940465. All research findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at vestibular as well as multidisciplinary international conferences and meetings.

MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) allows creation of large, sharply demarcated lesions with the safeguard of real-time imaging. OBJECTIVE: To characterise the outcomes of laser anterior capsulotomy, including radiographical predictors of improvement. METHODS: Patients with severe OCD refractory to pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy underwent bilateral anterior capsulotomy via LITT. The primary outcome was per cent reduction in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score over time. Lesion size was measured on postablation MRI. Disconnection of the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) was assessed via individual and normative tractography. RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent laser anterior capsulotomy. Median follow-up was 6 months (range 3-51 months). Time occupied by obsessions improved immediately (median Y-BOCS item 1 score 4-1, p=0.002). Mean (SD) decrease in Y-BOCS score at last follow-up was 46%32% (1611 points, p<0.0001). Sixty-one per cent of patients were responders. Seven patients (39%) exhibited transient postoperative apathy. One patient had an asymptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. Reduction in Y-BOCS score was positively associated with ablation volume (p=0.006). Individual tractography demonstrated durable ALIC disconnection. Normative tractography revealed a dorsal-ventral gradient, with disconnection of orbitofrontal streamlines most strongly associated with a positive response (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Laser anterior capsulotomy resulted in immediate, marked improvement in OCD symptom severity. Larger lesions permit greater disconnection of prefrontal-subcortical pathways involved in OCD. The importance of greater disconnection is presumably related to variation in ALIC structure and the complex role of the PFC in OCD.","output":"Interstitial laser anterior capsulotomy for obsessive-compulsive disorder: lesion size and tractography correlate with outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This study aims to assess generalizability by splitting datasets into different portions based on 3D CT images using deep learning. METHOD: Two large datasets, including 1110 3D CT images, were split into five segments of 20% each. Each dataset's first 20% segment was separated as a holdout test set. 3D-CNN training was performed with the remaining 80% from each dataset. Two small external datasets were also used to independently evaluate the trained models. RESULTS: The total combination of 80% of each dataset has an accuracy of 91% on Iranmehr and 83% on Moscow holdout test datasets. Results indicated that 80% of the primary datasets are adequate for fully training a model. The additional fine-tuning using 40% of a secondary dataset helps the model generalize to a third, unseen dataset. The highest accuracy achieved through transfer learning was 85% on LDCT dataset and 83% on Iranmehr holdout test sets when retrained on 80% of Iranmehr dataset.

While there are complex models to inform both potential health and macro-economic impact, there are few tools available to rapidly assess potential equity impacts of interventions. METHODS: We created an economic model to simulate the impact of lockdown measures in Pakistan, Georgia, Chile, UK, the Philippines and South Africa. We consider impact of lockdown in terms of ability to socially distance, and income loss during lockdown, and tested the impact of assumptions on social protection coverage in a scenario analysis. RESULTS: In all examined countries, socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles 1-3 were disproportionately more likely to experience income loss (70% of people) and inability to socially distance (68% of people) than higher SES quintiles. Improving social protection increased the percentage of the workforce able to socially distance from 48% (33%-60%) to 66% (44%-71%). We estimate the cost of this social protection would be equivalent to an average of 0.6% gross domestic product (0.1% Pakistan-1.1% Chile). CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate the potential for using publicly available data to rapidly assess the equity implications of social protection and non-pharmaceutical intervention policy. Social protection is likely to mitigate inequitable health and economic impacts of lockdown. Although social protection is usually targeted to the poorest, middle quintiles will likely also need support as they are most likely to suffer income losses and are disproportionately more exposed.","output":"Exploring equity in health and poverty impacts of control measures for SARS-CoV-2 in six countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increased incidence of out-of-hospital sudden death (OHSD) has been reported during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHODS: The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULTS: Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman &#961; 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R2 = 0.645). CONCLUSION: The association in geographic distribution between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden suggests either a causality between the 2 syndromes or the presence of local determinants affecting both measures in a similar fashion.","output":"Association between regional distributions of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and out-of-hospital sudden death during the first epidemic outbreak in New York"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus has been linked to cases of acute fatal pneumonia in dogs in several countries.

The pathogenesis of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus infection in dogs is poorly understood. This study systematically characterized the histopathological changes in the lungs of 39 dogs from a large rehoming shelter in London, United Kingdom; the dogs were infected with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. An objective scoring system demonstrated that S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus caused pneumonia in 26/39 (66.7%) dogs, and most of these dogs (17/26 [65.4%]) were classified as severe fibrino-suppurative, necrotizing, and hemorrhagic. Three recently described superantigen genes (szeF, szeN, and szeP) were detected by PCR in 17/47 (36.2%) of the S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus isolates; however, there was no association between the presence of these genes and the histopathological score. The lungs of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus-infected dogs with severe respiratory signs and lung pathology did however have significantly higher mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) than in uninfected controls, suggesting a role for an exuberant host immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease.","output":"Characterization of pneumonia due to Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus in dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic radically transformed our daily clinical practice, raising the need not to lose close contact with patients without being able to see them face-to-face. These issues are even more felt and evident in fragile patients, as those affected by neuromuscular disease. An important help came from new digital technologies that allow clinicians to remotely monitor health status and any deterioration of chronically ill patients. METHODS: In this mini-review, an initiative of the Digital Technologies, Web and Social Media Study Group of the Italian Society of Neurology, we propose to analyze the approach to neuromuscular patients by looking over raising evidence on the main cornerstones of Telemedicine (TM): clinician-patient interaction, remote clinical assessment, remote monitoring, and digital therapeutics. In particular, we explored the strategies developed by researchers and their impact on the physical and emotional status of the patients, with particular focusing on their adherence to the program of virtual monitoring. RESULTS: TM plays an important role in each of four stages of approach to neuromuscular disease, having demonstrated validity in keep close clinical patient interaction, clinical assessment, remote monitoring, and telerehabilitation. Nevertheless, there is no remote alternative to electrophysiological testing neither validate tools to assess disability. CONCLUSION: The role of TM in neuromuscular care is yet underestimated but is crucial, beyond the pandemic era. Further development of TM is advisable, through making specific apps, remotely controlled by clinicians, and making more engaging clinicians-patients interaction.

Fear of secondary infections following COVID-19 has led to an escalation in antimicrobial use during the pandemic, while some antimicrobials have been repurposed as treatments for SARS-CoV-2, further driving antimicrobial resistance. India is one of the largest producers and consumers of antimicrobials globally, hence the task of curbing antimicrobial resistance is a huge challenge. Practices like empirical antimicrobial prescription and repurposing of drugs in clinical settings, self-medication and excessive use of antimicrobial hygiene products may have deteriorated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in India. However, the expanded production of antimicrobials and disinfectants during the pandemic in response to increased demand may have had an even greater impact on the threat of antimicrobial resistance through major impacts on the environment. The review provides an outline of the impact COVID-19 can have on antimicrobial resistance in clinical settings and the possible outcomes of the same on environment.

A link prediction model was developed using the complex heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph, SemNet, to predict missing links in biomedical literature for drug discovery. A web application visualized knowledge graph embeddings and link prediction results using TransE, CompleX, and RotatE based methods. The link prediction model achieved up to 0.44 hits@10 on the entity prediction tasks. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, served as a case study to demonstrate the efficacy of link prediction modeling for drug discovery. The link prediction algorithm guided identification and ranking of repurposed drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 primarily by text mining biomedical literature from previous coronaviruses, including SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). Repurposed drugs included potential primary SARS-CoV-2 treatment, adjunctive therapies, or therapeutics to treat side effects. The link prediction accuracy for nodes ranked highly for SARS coronavirus was 0.875 as calculated by human in the loop validation on existing COVID-19 specific data sets. Drug classes predicted as highly ranked include anti-inflammatory, nucleoside analogs, protease inhibitors, antimalarials, envelope proteins, and glycoproteins. Examples of highly ranked predicted links to SARS-CoV-2: human leukocyte interferon, recombinant interferon-gamma, cyclosporine, antiviral therapy, zidovudine, chloroquine, vaccination, methotrexate, artemisinin, alkaloids, glycyrrhizic acid, quinine, flavonoids, amprenavir, suramin, complement system proteins, fluoroquinolones, bone marrow transplantation, albuterol, ciprofloxacin, quinolone antibacterial agents, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. Approximately 40% of identified drugs were not previously connected to SARS, such as edetic acid or biotin.

However, when perforators arise near the aneurysm neck, parent artery occlusion has a high risk of causing medullary infarction. As an alternative treatment, we performed short-segment internal trapping of the artery using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and coils (bird's nest trapping). Before treatment, perianeurysmal perforators are carefully detected using high-resolution three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA). Double microcatheters are advanced to the distal portion of the aneurysm through a balloon guiding catheter where coils are deployed without tight packing. Then, NBCA is injected into the coil mass, taking care to preserve perforators and significant branches. The same maneuver is repeated in the proximal portion of the aneurysm. Coil placement is avoided within the middle of the aneurysm; however, if necessary, only a small number of coils are placed to prevent worsening of mass effect. Two quinquagenarian males presented with a large thrombosed fusiform VAA that caused symptoms due to mass effect. In each case, perforators arose from the parent artery and short-segment internal trapping with NBCA and coils was performed. Symptoms improved after treatment and follow-up imaging confirmed aneurysm shrinkage with no long-time recurrence. In symptomatic large fusiform VAAs where the distance from the lesion to important perforators is extremely short, internal trapping using a combination of NBCA and coils can be more useful than conventional internal trapping.","output":"Short-segment Internal Trapping for Symptomatic Thrombosed Large Fusiform Vertebral Artery Aneurysms (Bird's Nest Trapping): A Technical Note."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutral metallo-aminopeptidase (APN) catalyzes the cleavage of neutral and basic amino acids from the N-terminus of protein or peptide substrates. APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases as well as in several types of cancer. Therefore, inhibitors of APN may be effective against cancer and inflammation. By virtual screening and enzymatic assays, we identified three non-competitive inhibitors ( > 1) of the porcine and human APN with K(i) values in the M range. These non-peptidic compounds lack the classical zinc-binding groups (ZBG) present in most of the APN inhibitors. Molecular docking simulations suggested the novel inhibitors suppress APN activity by an alternative mechanism to Zn coordination: they interacted with residues comprising the S1 and S5 subsites of APN. Of note, these compounds also inhibited the porcine aminopeptidase A (pAPA) using a competitive inhibition mode. This indicated differences in the binding mode of these compounds with APN and APA. Based on sequence and structural analyses, we predicted the significance of targeting human APN residues: Ala-351, Arg-442, Ala-474, Phe-896 and Asn-900 for improving the selectivity of the identified compounds.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of published studies and ongoing clinical studies related to the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in children or adolescents (aged < 18 years). Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched on 23 July 2021. International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) was also searched to identify ongoing studies. Results: Eight published studies with a total of 2852 children and adolescents and 28 ongoing clinical studies were included. Of the eight published studies, two were RCTs, two case series, and four case reports. The investigated COVID-19 vaccines had good safety profiles in children and adolescents. Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and chest pain were the most common adverse events. A limited number of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were reported. The RCTs showed that the immune response to BNT162b2 in adolescents aged 12C15 years was non-inferior to that in young people aged 16C25 years, while with 3 g CoronaVac injection the immune response was stronger than with 1.5 g. The efficacy of BNT162b2 was 100% (95% CI: 75.3 to 100), based on one RCT. Of the 28 ongoing clinical studies, twenty-three were interventional studies. The interventional studies were being conducted in fifteen countries, among them, China (10, 43.5%) and United States(9, 39.1%) had the highest number of ongoing trials. BNT162b2 was the most commonly studied vaccine in the ongoing trials.

To study the possible immune evasion of the type III IFN response by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells was developed as a cell model for PEDV replication. IFN-1 and IFN-3 inhibited PEDV replication, indicating the anti-PEDV activity of type III IFNs. Of the 21 PEDV proteins, nsp1, nsp3, nsp5, nsp8, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, open reading frame 3 (ORF3), E, M, and N were found to suppress type III IFN activities, and IRF1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) signaling mediated the suppression. PEDV specifically inhibited IRF1 nuclear translocation. The peroxisome is the innate antiviral signaling platform for the activation of IRF1-mediated IFN- production, and the numbers of peroxisomes were found to be decreased in PEDV-infected cells. PEDV nsp1 blocked the nuclear translocation of IRF1 and reduced the number of peroxisomes to suppress IRF1-mediated type III IFNs. Mutational studies showed that the conserved residues of nsp1 were crucial for IRF1-mediated IFN- suppression. Our study for the first time provides evidence that the porcine enteric virus PEDV downregulates and evades IRF1-mediated type III IFN responses by reducing the number of peroxisomes.IMPORTANCE Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that emerged in swine in the United States and has caused severe economic losses. PEDV targets intestinal epithelial cells in the gut, and intestinal epithelial cells selectively induce and respond to the production of type III interferons (IFNs). However, little is known about the modulation of the type III IFN response by PEDV in intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we established a porcine intestinal epithelial cell model for PEDV replication. We found that PEDV inhibited IRF1-mediated type III IFN production by decreasing the number of peroxisomes in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. We also demonstrated that the conserved residues in the PEDV nsp1 protein were crucial for IFN suppression. This study for the first time shows PEDV evasion of the type III IFN response in intestinal epithelial cells, and it provides valuable information on host cell-virus interactions not only for PEDV but also for other enteric viral infections in swine.","output":"Type III Interferon Restriction by Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus and the Role of Viral Protein nsp1 in IRF1 Signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was to observe smoking behaviours and infection control behaviours in smokers at outdoor smoking hotspots during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong.

Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training the model in a single organization, which is most common weakness due to the privacy and security of raw data communication. To solve this challenging task, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework that provides collaborative data training solutions by coordinating multiple hospitals to train and share encrypted federated models without leakage of data privacy. The blockchain ledger technology provides the decentralization of federated learning model without any central server. The proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of model to preserve the privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: i) train the local model by a novel capsule network to segmentation and classify COVID-19 images, ii) then use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, and finally the model is shared over a decentralized platform through proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm.

METHODS: A nationwide ecologic study based on open-sourced, anonymized, aggregated data provided by the Israel Ministry of Health. The correlations between municipal SES, vaccination percentage, and active COVID-19 cases during the vaccination campaign were analyzed by using weighted Pearson correlations. To assess the adequacy of first dose vaccination rollout relative to the municipality COVID-19 disease burden, a metric termed the vaccination need ratio was devised by dividing the total number of active cases (per 10,000 people) by the vaccination percentage of the population over 60 in each municipality, and its correlation with the SES was examined. RESULTS: 23 days after initiation of the vaccination campaign, 760,916 (56.8%) individuals over the age of 60 were vaccinated in Israel with the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. A negative correlation was found between the COVID-19 active case burden and the vaccination percentage of the study population in each municipality (r=-0.47, 95% confidence interval [-0.59 to -0.30]). The vaccination percentage significantly correlated with the municipal SES (r=0.83, 95% confidence interval [0.79 to 0.87]). This finding persisted but was attenuated over a five-week period. A negative correlation between the vaccination need ratio and municipal SES (r=-0.80, 95% confidence interval [-0.88 to -0.66]) was found. CONCLUSION: Lower COVID-19 vaccination percentage was associated with lower SES and high active disease burden.

We compared 1) the prevalence of underlying health conditions between COVID and non-COVID related deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of COVID-19 compared with other primary causes of death, stratified by sex and age group. Results Of 144,279 adult deaths recorded during the study period, 36,438 (25.3%) were confirmed COVID cases. Women represented 43.2% (n=15,731) of COVID deaths compared to 51.9% (n=55,980) in non-COVID deaths. Overall, COVID deaths were younger non-COVID deaths (82 vs. 83 years). ASMR of COVID-19 was higher than all other common primary causes of death, across age groups and sexes, except for cancers in women between the ages of 30-79 years. A linear relationship was observed between ASMR and age amongst COVID-19 deaths, with persistently higher rates in men than women across all age groups.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is an important humoral regulatory system of the body that exists widely in various tissues and organs. As a compensatory mechanism, the RAAS is typically activated to participate in the regulation of target organ function. RAAS activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of CRS. The RAAS induces the onset and development of CRS by mediating oxidative stress, uremic toxin overload, and asymmetric dimethylarginine production. Research on the mechanism of RAAS-induced CRS can provide multiple intervention methods that are of great significance for reducing end-stage organ damage and further improving the quality of life of patients with CRS.","output":"Role and Mechanism of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System in the Onset and Development of Cardiorenal Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The GEF project of environmental sustainability management for medical waste in China has been developed and implemented.

To obtain more insight into the signals and molecular events that coordinate global host responses in the nucleus of coronavirus-infected cells, first, transcriptome dynamics was studied in human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)-infected A549 and HuH7 cells, respectively, revealing a core signature of upregulated genes in these cells. Compared to treatment with the prototypical inflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)-1, HCoV-229E replication was found to attenuate the inducible activity of the transcription factor (TF) NF-B and to restrict the nuclear concentration of NF-B subunits by (i) an unusual mechanism involving partial degradation of IKK, NEMO and IB and (ii) upregulation of TNFAIP3 (A20), although constitutive IKK activity and basal TNFAIP3 expression levels were shown to be required for efficient virus replication. Second, we characterized actively transcribed genomic regions and enhancers in HCoV-229E-infected cells and systematically correlated the genome-wide gene expression changes with the recruitment of Ser5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and prototypical histone modifications (H3K9ac, H3K36ac, H4K5ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me1). The data revealed that, in HCoV-infected (but not IL-1-treated) cells, an extensive set of genes was activated without inducible p65 NF-B being recruited. Furthermore, both HCoV-229E replication and IL-1 were shown to upregulate a small set of genes encoding immunomodulatory factors that bind p65 at promoters and require IKK activity and p65 for expression. Also, HCoV-229E and IL-1 activated a common set of 440 p65-bound enhancers that differed from another 992 HCoV-229E-specific enhancer regions by distinct TF-binding motif combinations. Taken together, the study shows that cytoplasmic RNA viruses fine-tune NF-B signaling at multiple levels and profoundly reprogram the host cellular chromatin landscape, thereby orchestrating the timely coordinated expression of genes involved in multiple signaling, immunoregulatory and metabolic processes.","output":"The NF-B-dependent and -independent transcriptome and chromatin landscapes of human coronavirus 229E-infected cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To describe personal conditions and home structure that predisposes the elderly to the risk of falling, in the perspective of Neuman's stressors; to describe the content, structure and origin of social representations about falling at home by elderly people; and conjecture the implications of this empirical evidence on the daily lives of the elderly in the context of the pandemic caused by COVID-19.

Faster transmission rate and genetic modifications have provoked scientists to search for an immediate solution. With an increasing death rate, it becomes important to throw some light on the life cycle of the virus and its associated pathogenesis in the form of lung inflammation through cytokine storm (CS) production. This paper highlights the different stages of viral-mediated inflammatory responses in the host respiratory system. Previously, known anti-inflammatory drugs and therapeutic strategies that might show potential in controlling the CS of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is also mentioned in this study. Our critical analysis provides insights into the inflammation cycle induced in the lungs by early virus replication, downregulation and shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in the CS production. Identification of suitable targets within the inflammatory pathways for devising the therapeutic strategies useful in controlling the prognosis of COVID-19 finds a special mention in this article. However, antibody-dependent enhancement is the key aspect to consider before testing any drug/compound for therapeutic purposes. Our in-depth analysis would provide similarities and differences between the inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, providing an excellent avenue to further look at how earlier outbreaks of coronaviruses were controlled and where new steps are required?","output":"SARS-CoV-2 mediated lung inflammatory responses in host: targeting the cytokine storm for therapeutic interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Financial reliability, along with clearness of business transactions, is one of the mainstays of sustainability. In this research, I investigate whether enterprises expand discretionary revenue when their income before intentional shaping is marginally under the consensus on the income prediction provided by analysts. The innovation of the paper lies in taking into account the role of managerial ownership, ownership concentration, and higher proportions of institutional investors in this situation. Higher ownership concentration and greater percentage of institutional investors in equity were analysed while considering the expropriation hypothesis. In order to assess the concern of managerial ownership for revenue manipulation, I considered the alignment of interest hypothesis. In this research, I certified that enterprises expand discretionary revenue when their revenue and operating income prior to intentional shaping barely miss the consensus forecast. I found that the existence of managerial ownership curtailed the magnitudes of upward discretionary revenue when revenue prior to intentional shaping was marginally below the consensus on revenue. Greater ownership concentration and higher proportions of institutional investors were on the bound of the statistical trend to expand discretionary revenue when net earnings, before intentional shaping, were marginally below analysts forecasts.","output":"Revenue Identification in Attaining Consensus Estimates on Income Predictions: The Function of Ownership Concentration and Managerial Ownership Confirmation from Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rotaviruses (RVs) are a major cause of neonatal diarrhoea in humans and animals worldwide. In this study, 425 faecal samples were collected between 1999 and 2013 from diarrhoeic livestock and companion animals at different locations in Germany and tested for RVs. A previously published real-time RT-PCR assay was optimized for detection of a larger variety of RV species A (RVA) strains, and real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of RV species B (RVB) and C (RVC) were newly developed. The detection limits of the assays were 1.5410(2), 3.9510(2) and 3.6010(3) genome copies for RVA, RVB and RVC, respectively. RVA was identified in 85.2% of bovine samples, 51.2% of porcine samples, 50.0% of feline samples, 43.2% of equine samples and 39.7% of canine samples. RVB was found in 3.0% of bovine samples, 2.7% of equine samples and 1.6% of porcine samples. RVC was detected in 31.0% of porcine samples, 21.7% of feline samples, 9.0% of canine samples and 6.0% of bovine samples.

Specifically, we want to analyze if nectar traits influence visitor's performance throughout flower lifetime and if honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier, 1836) are effective and efficient for coffee pollination comparing fertilization and fructification among four experimental treatments: open (OP), wind (WP), cross (HCP), and single-visit bee pollination (SVBP). We found that honeybees collect both nectar and pollen from coffee flowers and transfer pollen on stigmas even after one visit. No differences were found among treatments regarding the number of pollen grains transferred on the stigmas (effectiveness). OP flowers showed a comparative lower efficiency (pollen tubes and fruit set) probably due to pollination failure as those flowers have a higher variability on the number of deposited pollen grains. Two of the treatments (HCP and SVBP) showed higher fertilization (measuring tubes until the end of the style). Pollen loads seem to be limited by a peak of pollen transference by pollinators, followed by the stabilization in the number of pollen grains deposited per stigma. Thus, reproduction of the coffee can be limited by the quality of pollen grains moved by pollinators instead of quantity. Management strategies should focus on monitoring bee density on plants for increasing pollen quality transfer on flowers trough maintaining the adequate proportions of seminatural habitats and/or the number of hives on agricultural fields according to the flowering of the crop.","output":"Performance, Effectiveness, and Efficiency of Honeybees as Pollinators of Coffea arabica (Gentianales, Rubiaceae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in the use of digital technology by Christian communities worldwide This paper offers a cross-continental analysis of how churches in Asia (Hong Kong and Singapore) and Europe (the United Kingdom and Sweden) understand and choose to implement (or resist) online services or Mass Undoubtedly, there are practical reasons behind differences which can be observed, such as the technological readiness found amongst church leadership and laity, and past experiences of public health crises, such as the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak However, accompanying these developments are debates around the theological implications of digitising church ministries, and the general concern that the digital church is somehow not 'church' or, even, not 'Christian' Different contextual perspectives help us to understand that the digital church offers a new dimension of the church embodied and, therefore, one that has the potential to live out the missio Dei within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Two or Three Gathered Online: Asian and European Responses to COVID-19 and the Digital Church"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a new variant of the Coronavirus that mutates and spreads rapidly between humans.

Histoplasmosis is prevalent in Latin America and Colombia, is difficult to diagnose and has a high mortality. Here we determined the clinical characteristics and risk factors of histoplasmosis in people living with HIV (PLWH) in Pereira, Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study (2014C2019) involving two tertiary medical centers in Pereira, Colombia. People hospitalized with HIV were included. Histoplasma antigen detection was performed in urine samples. Probable histoplasmosis was defined according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group criteria. RESULTS: 172 HIV-infected patients were analyzed. Histoplasmosis was confirmed in 29% (n = 50/172) of patients. The logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for histoplasmosis were pancytopenia (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6C10.3, P = 0.002), < 50 CD4 + cells/L (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3C7.3, P = 0.006) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) levels > 46 IU/L (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3C8, P = 0.010).

We computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in different Indian sub-populations with the top 100 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a p-value cutoff of 10-6 derived from the previous GWAS summary statistics1. We selected SNPs overlapping with the Indian Genome Variation Consortium (IGVC) and with similar frequencies in the Indian population. For each population, median PRS was calculated, and a correlation analysis was performed to test the association of these genetic risk scores with COVID-19 mortality. We found a varying distribution of PRS in Indian sub-populations. Correlation analysis indicates a positive linear association between PRS and COVID-19 deaths. This was not observed with non-risk alleles in Indian sub-populations. Our analyses suggest that Indian sub-populations differ with respect to the genetic risk for developing COVID-19 mediated critical illness.

Despite the fact that the majority of infected patients were managed in outpatient settings, little is known about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical comorbidity and the pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective analysis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings in Naples, Italy between 9 March and 1 May 2020. Data were sourced from the prospectively maintained Health Search (HS)/Thales database, shared by 128 primary care physicians (PCPs) in Naples, Italy. The clinical features and pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization and managed in outpatient settings have been described. RESULTS: A total of 351 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (mean age 54  17 years; 193 males) with outpatient management were evaluated. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (35%). The distribution of cardiovascular comorbidities showed no gender-related differences. A total of 201 patients (57.3%) were treated with at least one experimental drug for COVID-19. Azithromycin, alone (42.78%) or in combination (27.44%), was the most widely used experimental anti-COVID drug in outpatient settings. Low Molecular Weight Heparin and Cortisone were prescribed in 24.87% and 19.4% of the study population, respectively. At multivariate regression model, diabetes (risk ratio (RR): 3.74; 95% CI 1.05 to 13.34; p = 0.04) and hypertension (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.7; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with the experimental anti-COVID drug administration. Moreover, only diabetes (RR: 2.43; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.8; p = 0.03) was significantly associated with heparin administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a high prevalence of hypertension, more likely treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RASS) inhibitors, among COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization.

In this study, we investigated whether the enzyme is involved in the regulation of the STING pathway, which is the main signaling activated in the presence of both self- and pathogen DNA in the cytoplasm, leading to type I IFN (IFN I) production. In this study, we demonstrated that TG2 negatively regulates STING signaling by impairing IRF3 phosphorylation in bone marrow-derived macrophages, isolated from wild-type and TG2 knockout mice. In the absence of TG2, we found an increase in the IFN-? production and in the downstream JAK/STAT pathway activation. Interestingly, proteomic analysis revealed that TG2 interacts with TBK1, affecting its interactome composition. Indeed, TG2 ablation facilitates the TBK1-IRF3 interaction, thus indicating that the enzyme plays a negative regulatory effect on IRF3 recruitment in the STING/TBK1 complex. In keeping with these findings, we observed an increase in the IFN? production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from COVID-19-positive dead patients paralleled by a dramatic decrease of the TG2 expression in the lung pneumocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that TG2 plays a negative regulation on the IFN-? production associated with the innate immunity response to the cytosolic presence of both self- and pathogen DNA.","output":"Transglutaminase 2 Regulates Innate Immunity by Modulating the STING/TBK1/IRF3 Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to significant respiratory failure with between 14% and 18% of hospitalised patients requiring critical care admission.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the impact of deprivation on 30-day mortality. Critical care capacity was described by reporting the percentage of baseline ICU bed utilisation required.Results: There were 735 patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units across Scotland from 1/3/2020 to 20/6/2020. There was a higher proportion of patients from more deprived areas, with 183 admissions (24.9%) from the most deprived quintile and 100 (13.6%) from the least deprived quintile. 30-day mortality was 34.8%.

METHODS: We compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under \\"mitigation\\" to modelled events under \\"no mitigation\\" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at 20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses. RESULTS: The UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, 33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and 1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at 20,000/QALY.

RESULTS: All demographic subgroups studied reported numeric decreases in dignity from 2017 to 2021, with many of these decreases being both large and significant. With few group-year exceptions, subjective dignity relates to lower levels of depression and higher self-rated health, with dignity-depression associations significantly increasing from 2017 to 2021.

Parents of young children are particularly at risk for high levels of parental stress due to the current public health crisis, which can impact parenting behaviors and children's well-being. Although different initial scales have been developed to measure COVID-19-related anxiety, they have not yet been tested sufficiently in parent samples. A brief measure of COVID-19-related anxiety is necessary for both quick assessment in practice and in larger epidemiological studies of parents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the distributions, validities, and reliabilities of four different COVID-19 anxiety scales: Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Pandemic Anxiety Scale, and one subscale of the COVID Stress Scales. Based on the psychometric properties of these scales, we aim to provide recommendations for a brief unidimensional inventory to assess COVID-19-related anxiety among parents. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey of 515 German-speaking parents (465 mothers, 90.3%) with at least one child aged 0-6 years was conducted during a 6-week period (June 29 to August 9, 2020). Half of the parents were recruited via Facebook parenting groups, while the other half were recruited through childcare centers. We psychometrically tested 25 items on COVID-19-related anxiety using the framework of classical test theory, including item analysis, correlational analysis of family variables, and exploratory factor analysis. Moreover, an item response theory approach was applied to estimate item discriminations and item difficulties. RESULTS: Based on the psychometric properties, three items of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale were identified as a single unidimensional factor. The adapted scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (&#945;=.79), moderate to high item discrimination, strong positive intercorrelation with two other COVID-19 anxiety scales, and a small positive association with parenting stress. Mothers and fathers did not differ in total scores (t513=-0.79, P=.42). CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggests that existing COVID-19-related anxiety scales measure different latent constructs of anxiety. Furthermore, all scales showed only small to moderate correlations with trait health anxiety, suggesting that COVID-19-related anxiety is distinct from general health anxiety. The adapted \\"disease anxiety\\" subscale of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale is an economical measure for assessing COVID-19-related anxiety in parents. Directions for future research are outlined.","output":"Measuring COVID-19 Related Anxiety in Parents: Psychometric Comparison of Four Different Inventories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, vehicles are increasingly being connected to the Internet of Things, which enables them to obtain high-quality services. However, the numerous vehicular applications and time-varying network status make it challenging for onboard terminals to achieve efficient computing. Therefore, based on a three-stage model of local-edge clouds and reinforcement learning, we propose a task offloading algorithm for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). First, we establish communication methods between vehicles and their cost functions. In addition, according to the real-time state of vehicles, we analyze their computing requirements and the price function. Finally, we propose an experience-driven offloading strategy based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The simulation results show that the algorithm increases the probability of success for the task and achieves a balance between the task vehicle delay, expenditure, task vehicle utility and service vehicle utility under various constraints.","output":"Research on a Task Offloading Strategy for the Internet of Vehicles Based on Reinforcement Learning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of compounds containing a 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane fragment were evaluated for their antiviral activity against influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) in vitro. The most potent antiviral compound proved to be a quaternary ammonium salt based on (-)-borneol, 10a. In in vitro experiments, compound 10a inhibited influenza A viruses (H1, H1pdm09, and H3 subtypes), with an IC(50) value of 2.4-16.8 M (depending on the virus), and demonstrated low toxicity (CC(50) = 1311 M). Mechanism-of-action studies for compound 10a revealed it to be most effective when added at the early stages of the viral life cycle. In direct haemolysis inhibition tests, compound 10a was shown to decrease the membrane-disrupting activity of influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34.

To date, 18 species of virus from 12 genera have been demonstrated to be dependent on DDX3 for virulence. In addition, DDX3 has been shown to function within 7 of 10 subcellular regions that are involved in the metabolism of viruses. As such, due to its direct interaction with viral components across most or all stages of viral life cycles, DDX3 can be considered an excellent host target for pan-antiviral drug therapy and has been reported to be a possible broad-spectrum antiviral target. Along these lines, it has been demonstrated that treatment of virally infected cells with small molecule inhibitors of DDX3 blunts virion productions. On the other hand, DDX3 bolsters an innate immune response and viruses have evolved capacities to sequester or block DDX3, which dampens an innate immune response. Thus, enhancing DDX3 production or co-targeting direct viral products that interfere with DDX3's modulation of innate immunity would also diminish virion production. Here we review the evidence that supports the hypothesis that modulating DDX3's agonistic and antagonistic functions during viral infections could have an important impact on safely and efficiently subduing a broad-spectrum of viral infections.","output":"Targeting host DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X for treating viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Geraniin is a polyphenolic compound first isolated from Geranium thunbergii.

The recent structural and biophysical studies provided important evidence about multiple conformational substates of the D614G spike protein. The development of a plausible mechanistic model that can explain the experimental observations from a more unified thermodynamic perspective is an important objective of the current work. In this study, we employed efficient and accurate coarse-grained simulations of multiple structural substates of the D614G spike trimers together with the ensemble-based mutational frustration analysis to characterize the dynamics signatures of the conformational landscapes. By combining the local frustration profiling of the conformational states with residue-based mutational scanning of protein stability and network analysis of allosteric interactions and communications, we determine the patterns of mutational sensitivity in the functional regions and sites of variants. We found that the D614G mutation may induce a considerable conformational adaptability of the open states in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein without compromising the folding stability and integrity of the spike protein. The results suggest that the D614G mutant may employ a hinge-shift mechanism in which the dynamic couplings between the site of mutation and the interprotomer hinge modulate the interdomain interactions, global mobility change, and the increased stability of the open form. This study proposes that mutation-induced modulation of the conformational flexibility and energetic frustration at the interprotomer interfaces may serve as an efficient mechanism for allosteric regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.","output":"Landscape-Based Protein Stability Analysis and Network Modeling of Multiple Conformational States of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614G Mutant: Conformational Plasticity and Frustration-Induced Allostery as Energetic Drivers of Highly Transmissible Spike Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) is a recently described infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with significant cardiovascular implications. Although infection with SARS-CoV-2 is usually mild in children, some children later develop a severe inflammatory disease that can have manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease. This syndrome has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Although the prevalence is unknown, there have been more than 300 cases reported in the literature. MIS-C appears to be more common in Black and Hispanic children in the US. MIS-C typically occurs a few weeks after acute infection and the putative etiology is a dysregulated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common symptoms. Cardiac manifestations are common including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation and aneurysms, arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities. Severe cases can present in vasodilatory or cardiogenic shock requiring fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and in the most severe cases mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Empiric treatments have aimed at reversing the inflammatory response using immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and other immunomodulatory agents have been frequently used. Most patients recover within days to a couple of weeks and mortality is rare, although the medium- and long-term sequelae, particularly cardiovascular complications, are not yet known.

Gold has good ductility, molecular recognition properties, and good biocompatibility. At present, gold is being used in many fields. When gold particles are as small as several nanometers, their physical and chemical properties vary with their size in nanometers. The surface area of a nano-sized gold surface has a special effect. Therefore, gold nanoparticles can, directly and indirectly, give rise to different biological activities. For example, if the surface of the gold is sulfided. Various substances have a strong chemical reactivity and are easy to combine with sulfhydryl groups; hence, nanogold is often used in biomedical testing, disease diagnosis, and gene detection. Nanogold is easy to bind to proteins, such as antibodies, enzymes, or cytokines. In fact, scientists use nanogold to bind special antibodies, as a tool for targeting cancer cells. Gold nanoparticles are also directly cytotoxic to cancer cells. For diseases caused by inflammation and oxidative damage, gold nanoparticles also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Based on these unique properties, gold nanoparticles have become the most widely studied metal nanomaterials. Many recent studies have further demonstrated that gold nanoparticles are beneficial for humans, due to their functional pharmacological properties in a variety of diseases.

Using a well-characterized biomimetic collagen gel model of the capsular ligament's microstructure and innervation, this study evaluated extrasynpatic expression of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B) as a measure of neuronal dysfunction following tensile loading and determined mechanical thresholds for its upregulation in primary sensory neurons, with and without integrin inhibition. Collagen gels with dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons (n = 16) were fabricated; a subset of gels (n = 8) was treated with the 1 integrin subunit inhibitor, TC-I15. Gels were stretched to failure in tension and then immunolabeled for axonal NR2B. Inhibiting the integrin subunit does not change the failure force (p = 0.12) or displacement (p = 0.44) but does reduce expression of the 1 subunit by 41% (p < 0.001) and decrease axonal NR2B expression after stretch (p = 0.018).

GPS has recently been detected in Australia. While generally not harmful to trees in its area of origin, GPS has a detrimental impact on pine trees in Australia and, therefore, needs to be controlled. As part of an evaluation of the silver fly for importation to Australia where it may be used as a biological control agent against GPS, we studied several aspects of the flys life history, namely its seasonal occurrence and number of generations per year (phenology), its acceptance of artificial food sources as adult flies, and the number of eggs females produce over their lifetime. We found that the fly has three generations per year and feeds on all life stages of GPS (eggs, nymphs, and adults). Adults readily feed on a mixture of sugar and dry yeast, and females emerge with no or few eggs and develop more as they age. ABSTRACT: Neoleucopis kartliana Tanasijtshuk (Diptera, Chamaemyiidae) is the most abundant predator of the giant pine scale (GPS), Marchalina hellenica (Hemiptera, Margarodidae) in Greece. GPS is native to Greece and Turkey, where it is not considered a pest of Pinus spp., but a valuable resource for pine honey production. However, its introduction to new areas leads to high population densities of the scale, linked to declines in tree health and insect biodiversity. To assess the potential use of N. kartliana for a classical biological control program in Australia, we studied selected life-history traits of the silver fly, namely its phenology in northern Greece, feeding preferences of adult flies on artificial food sources, and potential fecundity of female flies. The silver fly was present in every site in northern Greece studied and was found to have at least three generations per year in this area. The flys overall sex ratio was 1:1, and adult females emerged with no or few mature eggs in their ovaries, but egg production was exponential until at least the eighth day after emergence. These findings increase our knowledge about the biology of N. kartliana and aided in the evaluation of the silver fly as a classical biological control agent against invasive GPS in Australia.","output":"Phenology and Potential Fecundity of Neoleucopis kartliana in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT The anterior choroidal artery (AChoA) is a rare location for intracranial aneurysms.

The type III secretion system 1 of the marine pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, utilizes the sequential action of four effectors to induce a rapid, pro-inflammatory cell death uniquely characterized by a pro-survival host transcriptional response (2, 3). Herein, we show that this pro-survival response is caused by the action of the channel-forming effector VopQ that targets the host V-ATPase resulting in lysosomal deacidification and inhibition of lysosome-autophagosome fusion. Recent structural studies have shown how VopQ interacts with the V-ATPase and, while in the ER, a V-ATPase assembly intermediate can interact with VopQ causing a disruption in membrane integrity. Additionally, we observe that VopQ-mediated disruption of the V-ATPase activates the IRE1 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) resulting in an IRE1-dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. We also find that this early VopQ-dependent induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is terminated by the VopS-mediated inhibitory AMPylation of Rho GTPase signaling. Since VopS dampens VopQ-induced IRE1-dependent ERK1/2 activation, we propose that IRE1 activates ERK1/2 phosphorylation at or above the level of Rho GTPases. This study illustrates how temporally induced effectors can work as in tandem as agonist/antagonist to manipulate host signaling and reveal new connections between V-ATPase function, UPR and MAPK signaling. Importance Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. para) is a seafood-borne pathogen that encodes two Type 3 Secretion Systems (T3SS). The first system T3SS1 is thought to be maintained in all strains of V. para to to maintain survival in the environment, whereas the second sytem T3SS2 is linked to clinical isolates and disease in humans. Herein, we find that first system targets evolutionarily conserved signaling systems to manipulate host cells, eventually causing a rapid, orchestrated cells death within three hours. We have found that the T3SS1 injects virulence factors that temporally manipulate host signaling. Within the first hour of infection, the effector VopQ acts first by activating host surval signals while diminishing the host cell apoptotic machinery. Less than an hour later, another effector VopS reverses activation and inhibition of these signaling systems ultimately leading to death of the host cell. This work provides example of how pathogens have evolved to manipulate the interplay between T3SS effectors to regulate host signaling pathways.","output":"Manipulation of IRE1-dependent MAPK signaling by a Vibrio agonist-antagonist effector pair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The aim was screening the performance of nine Early Warning Scores (EWS), to identify patients at high-risk of premature impairment and to detect intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, as well as to track the 2-, 7-, 14-, and 28-day mortality in a cohort of patients diagnosed with an acute neurological condition.

From the historical data analysis, we can also establish the pattern of hospitalized cases from active cases and also the pattern of various categories of bed occupancy numbers. The pattern is represented by minimum, maximum and average percentages. We have observed the second wave of COVID-19 in many European countries and is spreading more rapidly than the first wave. In India, we must be prepared to address the second wave as it might be more rampant since the lockdown is eased in most of the cities. Since traveling and gatherings are getting back to normal, significantly larger population might be susceptible and would need immediate hospitalization.

Methods: a systematic literature review assessing papers published in the most comprehensive databases in the field of health intended to answer the question, What are the effects of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, and what is the neonatal prognosis? Results: 49 papers published in 2020 were eligible, presenting low levels of evidence. A total of 755 pregnant women and 598 infants were assessed; more than half of pregnant women had C-sections (379/65%). Only 493 (82%) infants were tested for SARS-CoV-2, nine (2%) of whom tested positive. There is, however, no evidence of vertical transmission based on what has been assessed so far, considering there are knowledge gaps concerning the care provided during and after delivery, as well as a lack of suitable biological samples for testing SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: We cannot rule out potential worsening of the clinical conditions of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, whether the infection is associated with comorbidities or not, due to the occurrence of respiratory disorders, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and acid-base imbalance, among others.

Genetic association between COVID-19 and various lung disorders must be understood to comprehend the molecular basis of comorbidity and accelerate drug development. METHODS: Lungs tissue-specific neighborhood network of human targets of SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. This network was integrated with lung diseases to build a diseaseCgene and disease-disease association network. Network-based toolset was used to identify the overlapping disease modules and drug targets. The functional protein modules were identified using community detection algorithms and biological processes, and pathway enrichment analysis. RESULTS: In total, 141 lung diseases were linked to a neighborhood network of SARS-CoV-2 targets, and 59 lung diseases were found to be topologically overlapped with the COVID-19 module. Topological overlap with various lung disorders allows repurposing of drugs used for these disorders to hit the closely associated COVID-19 module. Further analysis showed that functional proteinCprotein interaction modules in the lungs, substantially hijacked by SARS-CoV-2, are connected to several lung disorders. FDA-approved targets in the hijacked protein modules were identified and that can be hit by exiting drugs to rescue these modules from virus possession. CONCLUSION: Lung diseases are clustered with COVID-19 in the same network vicinity, indicating the potential threat for patients with respiratory diseases after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathobiological similarities between lung diseases and COVID-19 and clinical evidence suggest that shared molecular features are the probable reason for comorbidity.

Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the US and Japan are probably the countries with the most severe outbreaks. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important for the development and measurement of public intervention strategies. Epidemic prediction results yielded by different mathematical models are inconsistent; therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results to generate objective conclusions. Methods: We used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020, to estimate the possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high-risk countries. The logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for prediction. Given that different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epidemic development. Results: When comparing all 8 countries short-term prediction results and peak predictions, the differences among the models were relatively large. The logistic growth model estimated a smaller epidemic size than the basic SERI model did; however, once we added parameters that considered the effects of public health interventions and control measures, the adjusted SERI model results demonstrated a considerably rapid deceleration of epidemic development. Our results demonstrated that contact rate, quarantine scale, and the initial quarantine time and length are important factors in controlling epidemic size and length. Conclusions: We demonstrated a comparative assessment of the predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak in eight high-risk countries using multiple methods. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time as well as simulating the effects of public health interventions, the intent of this paper is to help clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviors are critical to slow down the epidemic.","output":"Forecasting the Worldwide Spread of COVID-19 based on Logistic Model and SEIR Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis continues to be one of the leading causes of admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, representing a great challenge for researchers and healthcare staff.

However, few studies have uncovered its antitumor effects and its potential mechanisms against gastric cancer (GC). Therefore, this work aimed to identify the active compounds and putative targets of the SJZD and to further explore the potential mechanisms involved in the treatment of GC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active compounds and potential targets of the SJZD and related genes for GC treatment were collected from a public database. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-compound-target-disease networks, Venn diagrams, proteinCprotein interactions (PPIs), gene ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to obtain the bioactive compounds, key targets, and potential pathways. Next, the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line NUGC-4 was inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank of NCG mice to build a tumor-bearing mouse model to further verify the findings. RESULTS: There were 117 compounds in the SJZD in total. The SJZD and GC had 161 and 3288 potential targets, respectively, among which 123 targets overlapped. The network analysis showed that quercetin, kaempferol formononetin, ginsenoside, atractylenolide III, etc., were bioactive molecules. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53), transcription factor AP-1 (JUN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) were potential targets. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed 110 pathways involved in the pathways for cancer, including the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Validation experiments showed that the SJZD inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, the SJZD downregulated expressions of VEGFA, iNOS, COX-2, and Bax/Bcl2 and inhibited the expressions of p-PI3K and p-AKT.

The vaccines and bio-therapeutic protein production in plants hold the promise of significantly lowering the cost of manufacturing life-saving drugs. This review will reflect the current status and challenges that the molecular farming platform faces becoming a strategic solution for the development of low-cost bio-therapeutics for developing countries. RECENT FINDINGS: Different plant parts have been successfully identified as suitable expression systems for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins for some human and animal diseases ranging from common cold to AIDS. The processed therapeutics from such sources are devoid of any toxic components. The large-scale cultivation of these transgenic plants would be possible anywhere in the world including developing countries, which lack sophisticated drug manufacturing units. A couple of such commercially generated products have already hit the market with success. Newer methods using suitable plant viruses and recombinant gene expression systems have already been devised for producing therapeutic proteins and peptides. SUMMARY: Plants are promising bio-factories for therapeutic protein production because of their several advantages over the other expression systems especially the advanced mechanisms for protein synthesis and post-translational modification which are very much similar to animal cells. Plant biotechnologists are much attracted to the bio-farming because of its flexibility, scalability, low manufacturing cost, as well as the lack of risk of toxic or pathogenic contamination. A number of projects on bio-farming are designed and are at various developmental stages but have not yet become available to the pharmaceutical industry.

In year three, undergraduate students typically rotate across various hospitals and specialties and are expected to have dedicated rheumatology exposure for history and examination competencies. Rheumatology as an out-patient specialty can limit opportunities for medical students to have broad exposure to rheumatological conditions. Methods In January 2018, we designed an annual rheumatology half-day teaching workshop (Rheumatology Carousel) using a combination of lecture-based teaching and small group based guided clinical history and examination stations, aimed at third-year medical students from the University of Birmingham. This covered key presentations in rheumatology: axial spondyloarthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis (connective tissue disease), osteoarthritis, and vasculitis. Each station required a Clinical Teaching Fellow or Rheumatology ST trainee, overseen by one consultant facilitator. We designed patient proformas incorporating consent, demographics, key clinical history, therapy, and examination findings. We produced a written patient guide, and consultants invited appropriate patients to volunteer for the day. We designed a one-hour lecture-based tutorial. A lesson plan and schedule were created outlining faculty requirements; including time, roles, and faculty numbers. We invited five to six patients to each session, with a plan of four to five focussed examinations. We designed the carousel to accommodate up to 40 students, split into two groups running over a day. Focussed examinations involved students in groups of four, with each student being a lead examiner in at least one station, each station lasting 20 minutes. Best practice examination techniques for each condition were assessed and emphasised. Following a debrief, we collected feedback from students, faculty, and patients (online and written feedback), using Likert scores for teaching content, and quality of the session delivery. Results The carousel ran in February 2018, 19, and 20. The sessions were positively evaluated by students, faculty, and patients. In total, 93 students attended, 89/93 completed feedback. Satisfaction scores (mean; SD; range) were high (1-strongly disagree, 5-strongly agree) for content (4.8; 0.49, range 3-5) and quality of delivery (4.7; 0.54; 3-5). All patients who participated volunteered to return for future teaching sessions, with several patients attending all three years. Free text feedback indicated students valued structured exposure to core conditions and called for more sessions of this nature. Conclusion This sustainable reproducible intervention ensures students have structured exposure to important rheumatological conditions.

METHODS: Month by month pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for respiratory diagnoses during the first full COVID\\\\19 year were compared to those recorded for the six consecutive years preceding the pandemic. Data were collected from the patients' electronic files by utilizing a data extraction platform (MDClone(?)). RESULTS: A significant decline of 40% in respiratory ED visits and 54%C73% in respiratory hospitalizations during the first COVID\\\\19 year compared with the pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 years were observed (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The rate of respiratory ED visits out of the total monthly visits, mostly for asthma, peaked during June 2020, compared with proceeding years (109 [5.9%] versus 88 [3.9%] visits; p < 0.001). This peak occurred 2 weeks after the lifting of the first lockdown, resembling the back\\\\to\\\\school asthma phenomenon of September. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates important changes in the seasonality of pediatric respiratory illnesses during the first COVID\\\\19 year, including a new back\\\\from\\\\lockdown asthma peak.

Even in highly prevalent countries, primary gastroduodenal tuberculosis is a rare manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. In recent years, as the incidence of tuberculosis has increased year by year, the occur of gastroduodenal tuberculosis has also increased. Endoscopy is an important tool for diagnosing gastroduodenal tuberculosis. The performance of gastroduodenal tuberculosis under endoscopy is often non-specific, which may imitate other benign or malignant gastroduodenal diseases. Diagnosis of gastroduodenal tuberculosis relies on a combination of endoscopy and guided biopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a rare and interesting case of gastroduodenal tuberculosis with acute pancreatitis. The case initially mimicked gastroduodenal ulcers in morphology and appeared in a middle-aged person with normal immunity but with prolonged fever and abdominal pain. The disease was diagnosed through endoscopy and guided biopsy, and it responded well to antituberculosis drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must remember that even in the absence of immunodeficiency, as in this case, tuberculosis can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract.","output":"Primary gastroduodenal tuberculosis complicated with acute pancreatitis: a rare case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment measures can represent a traumatic experience, particularly for populations living in high incidence areas and individuals with mental disorders. The aim of this study was to prospectively examine posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depressive symptoms since the end of the first COVID-19 pandemic wave and Italy's national lockdown in subjects with mood or anxiety disorders living in 2 regions with increasing pandemic incidence. Methods: 102 subjects with a DSM-5 anxiety or mood disorder were enrolled from June to July 2020 and assessed at baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1) with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item, and Work and Social Adjustment Scale. At T1, subjects were also assessed by means of the Trauma and Loss Spectrum Self-Report for PTSD. Results: At T0, subjects from the high COVID-19 incidence area showed higher levels of traumatic symptoms than those from the low COVID-19 incidence area (P < .001), with a decrease at T1 with respect to T0 (P = .001). Full or partial DSM-5 PTSD related to the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in 23 subjects (53.5%) from the high COVID-19 incidence area and in 9 (18.0%) from the low COVID-19 incidence area (P < .001). Conclusions: Subjects with mood or anxiety disorders presented relevant rates of PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in the aftermath of the lockdown, and in most cases these persisted after 3 months. The level of exposure to the pandemic emerged as a major risk factor for PTSD development. Further long-term studies are needed to follow up the course of traumatic burden.","output":"Three-Month Follow-up Study of Mental Health Outcomes After a National COVID-19 Lockdown: Comparing Patients With Mood or Anxiety Disorders Living in an Area With a Higher Versus Lower Infection Incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s10811-021-02372-9.].","output":"Correction to: Docking and in silico toxicity assessment of Arthrospira compounds as potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted as a global pandemic.

This study aims to examine the economic distress faced by breast cancer patients receiving treatment at Tata Memorial Center (TMC) Mumbai, India during the nationwide lockdown initiated in March 2020 following the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 138 non-metastatic breast cancer patients who were accrued in this study at TMC before imposing of lockdown, and their treatment was impacted because of the COVID-19 outbreak, were interviewed. Telephonic interviews were conducted using a structured schedule which contained information on household and demographic characteristics of the patients, knowledge about COVID-19, their daily expenditure for treatment, difficulties faced during lockdown and how they met expenditures. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used in the analyses. RESULTS: The average monthly expenditure of cancer patients had increased by 32% during the COVID-19 period while the mean monthly household income was reduced by a quarter. More than two-thirds of the patients had no income during the lockdown. More than half of the patients met their expenditure by borrowing money, 30% of the patients used their savings, 28% got charity and 25% used household income. About 81% of the patients had reported shortage of money, 32% reported shortage of food and 28% reported shortage of medicine. The distress financing was significantly higher among patients receiving treatment in Mumbai compared to those receiving treatment at their native cities (67% vs. 46%), patients under 40 years of age, illiterate, currently married, Muslim and staying at a rented house. CONCLUSION: The incremental expenditure coupled with reduced or no income due to the closure of economic activities in the country imposed severe financial stress on breast cancer patients.","output":"Economic Distress of Breast Cancer Patients Seeking Treatment at a Tertiary Cancer Center in Mumbai during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Uncertainty exists regarding the best treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Simultaneous comparison of the multiple treatment options using traditional study designs is problematic; multiarm clinical trials often are logistically constrained to small sample sizes, and traditional meta-analyses are limited to comparisons of only two treatments that have been compared in head-to-head trials. Network meta-analyses allow for simultaneous comparison of all existing treatments utilizing both direct (head-to-head comparison) and indirect (not previously compared head-to-head) evidence. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer the following questions: Considering open repair, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) repair, functional rehabilitation, or primary immobilization for acute Achilles tendon ruptures, (1) which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of rerupture? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications resulting in surgery? METHODS This study was conducted with methods guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is reported in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for incorporating network meta-analysis. Five databases and grey literature sources (such as major orthopaedic meeting presentation lists) were searched from inception to September 30, 2019. Included studies were RCTs comparing treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures using two or more of the following interventions: primary immobilization, functional rehabilitation, open surgical repair, or MIS repair. We excluded studies enrolling patients with chronic ruptures, reruptures, and preexisting Achilles tendinopathy as well as studies with more than 20% loss to follow-up or less than 6 months of follow-up. Nineteen RCTs (1316 patients) were included in the final analysis. The mean number of patients per study treatment arm was 35  16, mean age was 41  5 years, mean sex composition was 80%  10% males, and mean follow-up was 22  12 months. The four treatment groups were compared for the main outcomes of rerupture and complications resulting in operation. The analysis was conducted using random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis with vague priors. Evidence quality was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We found risk of selection, attrition, and reporting bias to be low across treatments, and we found the risk of performance and detection bias to be high. Overall risk of bias between treatments appeared similar. RESULTS We found that treatment with primary immobilization had a greater risk of rerupture than open surgery (odds ratio 4.06 [95% credible interval {CrI} 1.47 to 11.88]; p < 0.05). There were no other differences between treatments for risk of rerupture. Minimally invasive surgery was ranked first for fewest complications resulting in surgery and was associated with a lower risk of complications resulting in surgery than functional rehabilitation (OR 0.16 [95% CrI 0.02 to 0.90]; p < 0.05), open surgery (OR 0.22 [95% CrI 0.04 to 0.93]; p < 0.05), and primary immobilization (OR < 0.01 [95% CrI < 0.01 to 0.01]; p < 0.05). Risk of complications resulting in surgery was no different between primary immobilization and open surgery (OR 1.46 [95% CrI 0.35 to 5.36]). Data for patient-reported outcome scores and return to activity were inappropriate for pooling secondary to considerable clinical heterogeneity and imprecision associated with small sample sizes. CONCLUSION Faced with acute Achilles tendon rupture, patients should be counseled that, based on the best-available evidence, the risk of rerupture likely is no different across contemporary treatments. Considering the possibly lower risk of complications resulting in surgery associated with MIS repair, patients and surgeons must balance any benefit with the potential risks of MIS techniques. As treatments continue to evolve, consistent reporting of validated patient-reported outcome measures is critically important to facilitate analysis with existing RCT evidence. Infrequent but serious complications such as rerupture and deep infection should be further explored to determine whether meaningful differences exist in specific patient populations.

While this is most often made through industry-placements, non-placement forms of work-integrated learning (WIL) can be highly effective in preparing graduates for the workplace without the issues of locating work-placements and ensuring their quality. In this paper, the authors focus on a chemical engineering course that combines non-placement WIL with a problem-oriented/project-based learning methodology, and a problem-solving tool, the Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD) framework. The authors present qualitative data from students, lecturers, and industry partners to evaluate whether the employability skills of creativity and teamwork are developed in the course. Through a process of qualitative analysis, the authors developed five key themes that provide a focused understanding of how the parts of the course relate to one another and drive student learning. The findings of this study indicate that the model of non-placement WIL evaluated was effective in building the defined employability skills; however, there are opportunities for iterative enhancement.

Results In total, 24 patients received the VIBE regimen, and a median of 3 cycles were administered. In this cohort, 80% of the patients had received 2 prior lines of therapy. The overall and complete response rates with VIBE were 79% and 42%, respectively. After a median follow-up (following VIBE regimen) of 14 months (range, 3-76), the 3-year EFS and OS were 46% and 74%, respectively. Of the eligible patients, 92% underwent successful AutoSCT.

Variants that proxy ACE inhibitor drug effects and cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lifetime smoking index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus) were selected from publicly available genome-wide association study data (sample sizes ranging from 188,577 to 898,130 participants). Genetic association estimates for lung expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were obtained from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (515 participants) and the Lung eQTL Consortium (1,038 participants). Genetic association estimates for circulating plasma ACE2 levels were obtained from the INTERVAL study (4,947 participants).

This study uses data on infections within households in order to estimate the susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. The data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR (637 households, average household size of 5.3). In addition, serological tests were performed on a subset of the individuals in the study. Inspection of the PCR data shows that children are less likely to be tested positive compared to adults (25% of children positive over all households, 44% of adults positive over all households, excluding index cases), and the chance of being positive increases with age. Analysis of joint PCR/serological data shows that there is under-detection of infections in the PCR testing, which is more substantial in children. However, the differences in detection rates are not sufficient to account for the differences in PCR positive rates in the two age groups. To estimate relative transmission parameters, we employ a discrete stochastic model of the spread of infection within a household, allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to differ among children and adults. The model is fitted to the household data using a simulated maximum likelihood approach. To adjust parameter estimates for under-detection of infections in the PCR results, we employ a multiple imputation procedure using estimates of under-detection in children and adults, based on the available serological data. We estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 43% (95% CI: [31%, 55%]) of the susceptibility of adults.

However, the roles of a XO inhibitor, febuxostat (FEB), in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling and hypertension independent of the serum uric acid level remain unclear. METHODS: To induce vascular remodeling in mice, angiotensin II (Ang II) was infused for 2 weeks with a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump. FEB was administered every day during Ang II infusion. Aortic fibrosis was assessed by elastica van Gieson staining. Mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells (RAW) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used for in vitro studies. RESULTS: FEB suppressed Ang II-induced blood pressure elevation and aortic fibrosis. Immunostaining showed that Ang II-induced macrophage infiltration in the aorta tended to be suppressed by FEB, and XO was mainly colocalized in macrophages, not in fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) mRNA expression was induced in the aorta in the Ang II alone group, but not in the Ang II + FEB group. Ang II induced -smooth muscle actin-positive fibroblasts in the aortic wall, but FEB suppressed them. XO expression and activity were induced by Ang II stimulation alone but not by Ang II + FEB in RAW. FEB suppressed Ang II-induced TGF-1 mRNA expression in RAW.

Six patients had parenchymal hemorrhage (33.3%), 11 had subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (61.1%), and one patient had subdural hemorrhage (5.6%). Three patients presented with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (16.7%). Conclusion: This study represents the largest case series of patients with intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed with COVID-19 based on key European countries with geospatial hotspots of SARS-CoV-2. Isolated SAH along the convexity may be a predominant bleeding manifestation and may occur in a late temporal course of severe COVID-19.","output":"Clinical and imaging characteristics in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute intracranial hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes in emotional state due to the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially modify eating habits, which may differ as a function of body mass index (BMI). Using a self-reported, questionnaire-based survey we evaluated Brazilian women during the pandemic for: (i) the influence of BMI on changes in eating habits, food choice determinants, and psychological symptoms; (ii) associations between eating habits, food choice determinants and psychological symptoms. General characteristics, anthropometric data, eating habits before and during the pandemic, food choice determinants and psychological symptoms during the pandemic were collected between June and September, 2020. Participants (n = 1,183) were normal weight (60.4%), overweight (26.2%) and obese (13.4%). A higher frequency of cooking (72.3C77.6%, p = 0.004) and use of delivery service (29.8C48.8%, p < 0.001) was reported during, in comparison to before the pandemic. Additionally, a higher prevalence of snacking (57.1C63.8%, p = 0.005) and eating at table (78.5C82.7%, p < 0.001) was reported during the pandemic, while the number of participants reporting dieting decreased (28.7C20.4%, p < 0.001). Health, natural concerns and need and hunger were less important determinants for participants with overweight/obesity compared to normal weight. Regression analysis indicated that (i) health, natural concerns and affect regulation; (ii) health, pleasure, convenience, and natural concerns; and (iii) visual appeal and pleasure were the food choice determinants more associated with eating habits among women with normal weight, overweight, and obesity, respectively.

AIM: This systematic review aims to explore the rate of missed primary care appointments, what the reported reasons are for appointments being missed, and which patients are more likely to miss appointments. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study reports the findings of a systematic review. The included studies report the rate or reasons of missed appointments in a primary care setting. METHOD: Databases were searched using a pre-defined search strategy. Eligible studies were selected for inclusion based on detailed inclusion criteria through title, abstract, and full text screening. Quality was assessed on all included studies, and findings were synthesised to answer the research questions. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Of these, 19 reported a rate of missed appointments. The mean rate of missed appointments was 15.2%, with a median of 12.9%. Twelve studies reported a reason that appointments were missed, with work or family/childcare commitments, forgetting the appointment, and transportation difficulties most commonly reported. In all, 20 studies reported characteristics of people likely to miss appointments. Patients who were likely to miss appointments were those from minority ethnicity, low sociodemographic status, and younger patients (<21 years).

Socio-demographic variables, allostatic load, stress, abnormal illness behavior, global well-being, mental status, and social support were assessed. RESULTS: There was no difference in allostatic load in medical workers compared to nonmedical workers (15.8 vs. 17.8%; p = 0.22). Multivariate conditional logistic regression revealed that anxiety (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.18-1.31; p < 0.01), depression (OR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.17-1.29; p < 0.01), somatization (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.14-1.25; p < 0.01), hostility (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.18-1.30; p < 0.01), and abnormal illness behavior (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.34-1.66; p < 0.01) were positively associated with allostatic load, while objective support (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.89; p < 0.01), subjective support (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.80-0.88; p < 0.01), utilization of support (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.72-0.88; p < 0.01), social support (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.87-0.93; p < 0.01), and global well-being (OR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.41; p < 0.01) were negatively associated.

Here, we introduce AliSim, a new tool that can efficiently simulate biologically realistic alignments under a large range of complex evolutionary models. To achieve high performance across a wide range of simulation conditions, AliSim implements an adaptive approach that combines the commonly used rate matrix and probability matrix approaches. AliSim takes 1.4 h and 1.3 GB RAM to simulate alignments with one million sequences or sites, whereas popular software Seq-Gen, Dawg, and INDELible require 2C5 h and 50C500 GB of RAM.

The consequential decrease in lung function ranges in severity from subclinical to life-threatening or even fatal and can manifest in the acute setting or many years after completion of therapy. Radiation effects are due to direct insult to the pulmonary parenchyma and, for younger children, impaired thoracic musculoskeletal development. Radiation pneumonitis can occur in the acute/subacute setting, as well as fibrosis with comprised gas exchange as a late effect of direct lung irradiation; thoracic wall malformation can cause restriction of function as a chronic sequela. The pulmonary effects of cytotoxic drugs usually present as acute effects, but there is the potential for significant late morbidity and mortality. Of course, surgical interventions can also cause both acute and/or late pulmonary effects as well, depending on the specific procedure. Although treatment approaches for the management of pediatric cancers are continually adapted to provide optimal therapy while minimizing toxicities, to a varying degree all therapies have the potential for both acute and late pulmonary toxicity. Of note, the cumulative incidence of pulmonary complications rises with increasing time since diagnosis, which suggests that adult survivors of childhood cancer require lifelong monitoring and management of potential new-onset pulmonary morbidity as they age.

Thus, an immunomodulatory approach targeting the over-production of cytokines could be proposed for viral aggressive pulmonary disease treatment. In this regard, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-?3, a member of the PPAR transcription factor family, could represent a potential target. Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-?3 also represses the inflammatory process.

We collected EBC samples from 30 healthy subjects during the first lockdown due to COVID-19 in Israel (MarchCApril 2020) and compared them to EBC samples retrieved during AprilCJune 2016 from 25 other healthy subjects (controls) living in the same northern Israeli district. All participants underwent EBC collection and blood sampling. Ambient air pollutant levels were collected from the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protections online database. Data were acquired from the monitoring station closest to each subjects home address, and means were calculated for a duration of 1 month preceding EBC collection. UFP contents were measured in the EBC and blood samples by means of the NanoSight LM20 system. There was a dramatic reduction in NO, NO(2), SO(2), and O(3) levels during lockdown compared to a similar period in 2016 (by 61%, 26%, 50%, and 45%, respectively). The specific NO(2) levels were 8.3 ppb for the lockdown group and 11.2 ppb for the controls (p = 0.01).

Being reduced to part-time work and working from home are not directly related to subjective well-being. At the same time, the strength of the association between subjective well-being and possible changes of the labor market status depends on such factors as the presence of children, as well as the value of self-enhancement (according to Schwartz) and conscientiousness (one of the Big Five personality-traits). The job or business loss is associated with a decrease in subjective well-being among respondents without children;this association is not observed among those with children. In addition, the negative relationship between life satisfaction and job or business loss is stronger among individuals with high level of self-enhancement and weaker among those with high level of conscientiousness.

However, critical times in STEMI management and outcomes may be influenced by infection control protocols implementation. The aim of this study is to investigate the differences in time intervals related to STEMI care and 15-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during this outbreak compared with the same period in last year and to determine whether the STEMI protocol should be changed to thrombolytic therapy during COVID-19 outbreak or not. Methods and results: The patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI in Tehran Heart Center were included. Chest Computed tomography (CT) imaging and real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) were only performed for COVID-19 suspected patients. Seventy-seven patients from 29th February to 29th March 2020 were compared with 62 patients from 1st to 30th March 2019. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by rRT-PCR in 5 cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 volunteers (48 control, 56 experimental group) who applied to the ENT clinic of Adiyaman University Training and Research Hospital were included in this study. After the detailed clinical examination and medical history, 13 volunteers of the experimental group and 5 volunteers from the control group were excluded from the study. In this way, each group consisted of 43 volunteers. While the experimental group consisted of patients who did not have any hearing problems before but had COVID-19. The control group consisted of healthy volunteers who did not have any hearing problems and were not infected with COVID-19. Audiological test was applied to all volunteers to determine their pure-tone average. On the data obtained, it was analyzed whether COVID-19 affects the pure-tone average and how it changes according to variables such as age and gender. RESULTS: The evaluation of the 43 (50.0%) COVID-19-positive patients and 43 (50.0%) healthy controls showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) at 250 and 500 Hz, whereas at 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, the two groups differed significantly.

A total of 90 618 patients were hospitalized for proximal lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis, and 3649 patients (4.1%) underwent CDT. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower at high-volume centers (0.6% versus 1.5%; P=0.04) with a trend toward lower intracranial hemorrhage rates compared with low-volume centers (0.4% versus 1%; P=0.07). No significant difference was seen with blood transfusion (10.4% versus 10.8%; P=0.70), gastrointestinal bleeding (1.4% versus 1.8%; P=0.35), or pulmonary embolism rates (18.4% versus 17.9%; P=0.72). Median length of stay was similar (6 days) and hospital charges were higher ($65 500 versus $75 870) at high-volume centers. CONCLUSIONS In this observational study, we found that an increase in institutional volume of CDT was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and lower intracranial hemorrhage rates. Further studies are needed to assess whether standardization of CDT protocols across all institutions in the United States improves outcomes.","output":"Impact of Institutional Volume on Outcomes of Catheter Directed Thrombolysis in the Treatment of Acute Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis: A 6-Year US Experience (2005-2010)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liberty versus security debate is again at the forefront and staring in our eyes This dimension of security studies where we find certain countries like Iran who are battling COVID-19 with all their might and that the virus is threating their sovereignty and their overall existence is a cause of concern There is no question that citizens have willingly accepted more surveillance and submitted more data to the state, but the question remains whether the state will relent after the outbreak of the COVID-19 is over and whether the State should retreat back to its normal positioning and resort back to Westphalian epitome?

This study aimed to investigate the pattern and predictors of nightmares among university students and coinvestigate the presence of other types of sleep disturbances, mental disorders, and quarantine-related stressors. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 368 university students who answered a self-completed questionnaire covering their sociodemographic features, nightmare indicators, and associated quarantine stressors. Additionally, sleep disturbances were measured using the Generalized Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2 scale, and depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Results: The participants mean age was 20.4  1.6 years, and male participants represented 35.9% of the sample. Nightmares were experienced by 117 (31.8%) of the participants, of whom 44.4% had new-onset nightmares. The mean GSDS was 45.0  14.9 (min. = 12, max. = 130). This value is associated with elevated odds of the following outcomes: the presence of nightmares (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8;confidence interval [CI] 95% = 1.1C3.0);new-onset nightmares at the time of pandemic (OR = 2.6;CI 95% = 1.3C5.5);and anxiety (OR = 1.74;CI 95% = 1.0C2.9). The presence of nightmares elevated the score of GSDS by 11.3 points (S.E. = 1.6, p < 0.001), elevated the odds of anxiety by 4.1 (CI 95% = 2.5C6.8), and depression by 2.1 (CI 95% = 1.3C3.4). Conclusions: Stressors resulting from both the exams period and the fact that it was conducted during COVID-19 quarantine increased the rate and affected the pattern of nightmares. These stressors also led to other sleep disturbances and mental disorders that were significantly more prevalent among females.","output":"Nightmares Pattern and Predictors among a Saudi University Students during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of new technologies and in particular those related to web 2 0, tend to encourage participation at the educational and creative level of users, increasing and personalizing the cultural offer, and to activate new mechanisms of interaction and comparison This aspect has revealed even more relevant in the course of 2020, when the issue of the pandemic linked to the virus Covid-19 has not only forced people to re-adapt to a lifestyle marked to online and digital but also cultural institutions to rethink the methods of dissemination of knowledge, both in the didactic field and in scientific communication Another fundamental aspect to be considered is, moreover, the bond and the relationship within the communities, even more strongly perceived in small Universities like that of Foggia Social media, in this sense, offer enormous potential for cultural communication in terms of visibility and distribution;the mobility of communication, possible through the most disparate digital devices, further favors the creation, sharing and dissemination of cultural contents It also demonstrates, an effective tool to achieve several public reference and even strengthen a sense of belonging, especially in a period of history that hinders physical presence In this context, this research work analyzes the key concepts related to engagement, audience development and effective content curation These studies were taken into consideration for the practical-operational application to the digital strategies implemented by the University of Foggia during the period April-August 2020 ? 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4 0 International (CC BY 4 0)","output":"What cultural institutions can learn from social networks?

The aim of this study is to assess if any difference in antibody concentration between subjects exposed and not exposed to SARS-CoV-2 prior to BNT162b2 was present after the first dose and after the second dose of vaccine. Data were retrospectively collected from the clinical documentation of 337 healthcare workers who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing before and after BNT162b2. Total anti RBD (receptor-binding domain) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2s spike protein were measured before and 21 days after the first dose, and 12 days after the second dose of BNT162b2. Twenty-one days after the first dose, there was a statistically significant difference in antibody concentration between the two groups, which was also maintained twelve days after the second dose. In conclusion, antibody response after receiving BNT162b2 is greater in subjects who have been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 than in subjects who have not been previously exposed to the virus, both after 21 days after the first dose and after 12 days from the second dose.

Scant research has specifically examined to what extent and in what aspects COVID-19 is beneficial to adolescent development so far. With person-centered approach, this research addressed this gap by: (1) exploring different profiles of positive changes in life outcomes in Chinese adolescents since the outbreak of COVID-19;(2) examining the role of resilience in relation to different profiles;(3) comparing mental health across adolescents categorized into different profiles. Method Participants were 2,567 Chinese adolescents aged 12 to 24. They rated how much their lives of different domains had experienced positive changes since the outbreak of the pandemic. They also answered the questionnaires that measured their resilience and mental health. Results Results of latent profile analysis revealed three different profiles: limited positive changes (33.3%), partial positive changes (49.5%), and overall strong positive changes (17.2%). Moreover, adolescents with a higher level of resilience were more likely to be categorized into the partial positive changes profile compared to the limited positive changes profile and into the overall strong positive changes profile compared to the other two profiles, after controlling for the covariates. Finally, adolescents in the overall strong positive changes profile had better mental health than their counterparts in the other two profiles.

High-intensity underground mining will cause large land subsidence. Differential SAR Interferometry (D-InSAR) is a popular monitoring method of land subsidence in recent years. This paper uses two-pass D-InSAR method to monitor land subsidence in Wuhai City. The experimental data selects 7 scenes of C-band Sentinel-1A images from September 2019 to March 2020. The final deformation results are shown in the Figure 3. The two-pass D-InSAR processing flow includes data focusing, baseline estimation, interferogram generation, adaptive filtering and coherence generation, phase unwrapping, orbit refining and re-flattening, deformation map generation. The result shows: During the monitoring time, the most serious subsidence areas are concentrated near the mine clusters on the east and west sides of Wuhai City. Maximum settlement value up to 242 mm. The subsidence values in heavy industrial and residential areas are slightly smaller compared to the former. Settlement values are generally ranged from 56 to 87 mm. The settlement is lightest in the southern part of Hainan district. It indicates that mining can greatly accelerate surface subsidence. Meanwhile, human activities and groundwater extraction can increase subsidence. From the perspective of time, Settlement in Wuhai City is more pronounced during September to December 2019 but it decreases sharply in January 2020.This should be related to the outbreak of COVID-19.

The Joint Advisory Group on GI endoscopy and British Society of Gastroenterology issued guidelines on endoscopy service delivery changes and restoration. We surveyed UK endoscopy clinical leads to gain insights into service restoration. METHODS: A Google Forms-designed survey, assessing endoscopy provision, Covid minimisation and referral pathways was circulated to all UK endoscopy leads. The survey was open between 19 and 24 May 2020. RESULTS: 97 endoscopy leads completed the survey, with all UK nations and regions represented. Analysis showed 20% of endoscopy services were not providing endoscopy. Workload limitations were due to enforced interprocedural downtime (92%; with some services enforcing >1-hour downtime between procedures), social distancing (88%) and working in personal protective equipment (PPE) (87%). 91% of services reported a referral backlog (urgent median 2 months, routine median 6 months). 96% of services reported no current problems accessing PPE. Level 1/2 PPE use in colonoscopy was not uniform. 63% of services routinely swab patients for COVID-19 before endoscopy, 88% of services do not routinely swab asymptomatic staff. Comments addressed reducing endoscopy demand through vetting and changing referral criteria, the mostly commonly cited strategy being increased faecal immunochemical testing in symptomatic patients (70% of services).

MethodsA cross-sectional online survey was conducted among all medical students studying in six batches of the Faculty of Medicine and Allied Sciences (FMAS), Rajarata University of Sri Lanka (RUSL). A Google form prepared in English with statements about individual perception of medical students role and their willingness to assist in the COVID-19 health sector response via value-added roles was used to collect data. ResultsOut of 856 (79.6%) study participants, the majority was females (n=601, 70.2%).

Methods Forty-two teams of medical and undergraduate nursing students participated in simulation-based training sessions using a two-scenario format with after-action debriefing. Observers rated team performance with an 11-item Teamwork Assessment Scales (TAS) instrument (three subscales, team-based behaviours (5-items), shared mental model (3-items), adaptive communication and response (3-items)). Two independent, blinded raters evaluated video-recorded facilitator team prebriefs and debriefs using the Objective Structured Assessment of Debriefing (OSAD) 8-item tool. Descriptive statistics were calculated, t-test comparisons made and multiple linear regression and univariate analysis used to compare OSAD item scores and changes in TAS scores. Results Statistically significant improvements in all three TAS subscales occurred from scenario 1 to 2. Seven faculty teams taught learners with all scores 3.0 (except two) for prebriefs and all scores  3.5 (except one) for debriefs (OSAD rating 1=done poorly to 5=done well). Linear regression analysis revealed a single statistically significant correlation between debrief engagement and adaptive communication and response score without significance on univariate analysis.

METHODS A retrospective chart review of patients necessitating a consultation by the foot and ankle surgery service were reviewed from the first 8 months of 2020. A total of 270 patients met the inclusion criteria and divided into pre-pandemic (n = 120) and pandemic groups (n = 150). Demographics, medical history, severity of current infection, and medical or surgical management were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The odds of undergoing any level of amputation was 10.8 times higher during the pandemic versus before the pandemic. The risk of major amputations (below-the-knee or higher) likewise increased with an odds ratio of 12.5 among all patients in the foot and ankle service during the pandemic. Of the patients undergoing any amputation, the odds for receiving a major amputation was 3.1 times higher than before the pandemic. Additionally, the severity of infections increased during the pandemic and a larger proportion of the cases were classified as emergent in the pandemic group compared to the pre-pandemic group.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to describe the epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory changes, and outcomes of viral pneumonia caused by influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, the medical records of all patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the period from January 2012 to December 2015 were screened. Cases who were > 18 years old and were confirmed by a respiratory viral panel to have viral pneumonia either MERS-CoV or influenza viruses were included in the analysis. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from patients' medical files. The data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially to identify the predictors of poor outcome. RESULTS: A total of 448 patients with confirmed viral pneumonia were included, of those, 216 (48.2%) were caused by influenza A (non H1N1)/influenza B, 150 (33.5%) by H1N1, and 82 (18.3%) by MERS-CoV. The majority of patients presented with fever (82%), shortness of breath (64%), and flu-like symptoms (54.9%), particularly in MERS-CoV infected cases (92%). The peak incidence of viral pneumonia was in early spring and autumn. The mortality rate was 13.8%, and it was significantly higher among MERS-CoV cases. The predictors of death were age > 65 years, male gender, and associated comorbidities particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney diseases. The number of comorbid illnesses was directly related to the increase in mortality in this group of patients. CONCLUSION: Viral pneumonia caused by influenza and MERS-CoV carries a high mortality rate, particularly among MERS-CoV infected cases. Old age, male gender, and comorbid illnesses are predictors of poor outcome.

Most cardiovascular diseases are often accompanied by arrhythmias. In clinical practice, an electrocardiogram (ECG) can be used as a primary diagnostic tool for cardiac activity and is commonly used to detect arrhythmias. Based on the hidden and sudden nature of the MIT-BIH ECG database signal and the small-signal amplitude, this paper constructs a hybrid model for the temporal correlation characteristics of the MIT-BIH ECG database data, to learn the deep-seated essential features of the target data, combine the characteristics of the information processing mechanism of the arrhythmia online automatic diagnosis system, and automatically extract the spatial features and temporal characteristics of the diagnostic data. First, a combination of median filter and bandstop filter is used to preprocess the data in the ECG database with individual differences in ECG waveforms, and there are problems of feature inaccuracy and useful feature omission which cannot effectively extract the features implied behind the massive ECG signals. Its diagnostic algorithm integrates feature extraction and classification into one, which avoids some bias in the feature extraction process and provides a new idea for the automatic diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. To address the problem of feature importance variability in the temporal data of the MIT-BIH ECG database, a hybrid model is constructed by introducing algorithms in deep neural networks, which can enhance its diagnostic efficiency.","output":"Online Automatic Diagnosis System of Cardiac Arrhythmias Based on MIT-BIH ECG Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper argues that outbreaks of infectious diseases should be understood as socio\\\\spatial processes with complex geographies.

To assess the effects of macromolecular crowding on unfolding of an oligomeric protein, we here tested the effects of the synthetic crowding agent Ficoll 70 on human cpn10 (GroES in E. coli), a heptameric protein consisting of seven identical -barrel subunits assembling into a ring. Using far-UV circular dichroism (CD), tyrosine fluorescence, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cross-linking experiments, we investigated thermal and chemical stability, as well as the heptamer-monomer dissociation constant, without and with crowding agent. We find that crowding shifts the heptamer-monomer equilibrium constant in the direction of the heptamer. The cpn10 heptamer is both thermally and thermodynamically stabilized in 300 mg/mL Ficoll 70 as compared to regular buffer conditions. Kinetic unfolding experiments show that the increased stability in crowded conditions, in part, is explained by slower unfolding rates. A thermodynamic cycle reveals that in presence of 300 mg/mL Ficoll the thermodynamic stability of each cpn10 monomer increases by over 30%, whereas the interfaces are stabilized by less than 10%.

Understanding the cellular entry mechanisms of EBOV can promote the development of new therapeutic strategies to control virus replication and spread. It has been known that EBOV virions bind to factors expressed at the host cell surface. Subsequently, the virions are internalized by a macropinocytosis-like process, followed by being trafficked through early and late endosomes. Recent researches indicate that the entry of EBOV into cells requires integrated and functional lipid rafts. Whilst lipid rafts have been hypothesized to play a role in virus entry, there is a current lack of supporting data. One major technical hurdle is the lack of effective approaches for observing viral entry. To provide evidence on the involvement of lipid rafts in the entry process of EBOV, we generated the fluorescently labeled Ebola virus like particles (VLPs), and utilized single-particle tracking (SPT) to visualize the entry of fluorescent Ebola VLPs in live cells and the interaction of Ebola VLPs with lipid rafts. In this study, we demonstrate the compartmentalization of Ebola VLPs in lipid rafts during entry process, and inform the essential function of lipid rafts for the entry of Ebola virus. As such, our study provides evidence to show that the raft integrity is critical for Ebola virus pathogenesis and that lipid rafts can serve as potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","output":"Single virus tracking of Ebola virus entry through lipid rafts in living host cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microorganisms lives with us in our environment, touching infectious material on the surfaces by hand-mouth which causes infectious diseases and some of these diseases are rapidly spreading from person to person.

Then we showed, by comparing transplant patients with immunocompetent patients matched for the main severity factors of the disease, that mortality among transplant patients was higher (17.9% vs 11.4%; P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, a creatinine level at admission above 115 mol/L was associated with death, whereas being transplanted was not. Finally, comparing the transplant cohort with patients on the kidney transplant waiting list during the period from February to June 2020, we found that patients on the waiting list had a higher Covid-19-related excess mortality than transplant patients, mainly in areas of low viral circulation.

However, population-representative variations in the total burden of psychiatric episodes across cancer types and treatment modalities have not been examined. We sought to estimate the risk of self-harm after incident psychiatric disorder diagnosis in patients with cancer, and the risk of unnatural deaths after self-harm. Design, Setting, Participants Population-based cohort study with multiphase study designs. Population-based linked patient records in England (1998-2020) from primary care practices, hospitals, cancer registry and death registry were employed. We identified 459,542 individuals age [] 18 years with an incident diagnosis of a site-specific cancer of interest. Main outcome measures Using outpatient and inpatient records, we identified patients with five psychiatric disorders of interest: depression, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and personality disorder. Cumulative burden for all psychiatric events was estimated using the mean cumulative count method. We considered 10 cancer treatment regimens, 11 chemotherapy drug classes, deprivation status and 21 non-cancer comorbidities in stratified analyses. Propensity score matching was employed to identify controls who did not have any record of a psychiatric disorder of interest. For each psychiatric disorder category, we fitted a Cox regression model to estimate the risk of self-harm. We also estimated the risk of all-cause mortality and excess years of life lost comparing patients with and without psychiatric disorders. A separate matched cohort was generated to explore the risk of suicide and unnatural deaths following self-harm. Results Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder in patients with cancer, where some of the highest cumulative burdens were observed in patients with testicular cancer (98.05 per 100 individuals [CI: 83.08-127.25]), cervical cancer (78.74 [73.61-90.14]) and Hodgkin lymphoma (69.87 [61.05-69.48]) by age 60. Patients who received chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery had the highest cumulative burden of psychiatric disorders, while patients who received radiotherapy alone had the lowest burden. Patients treated with alkylating agent chemotherapeutics had the highest burden of psychiatric disorders while those treated with kinase inhibitors had the lowest burden. Among patients with cancer, 5,683 individuals were identified as having an incident self-harm episode. A previous diagnosis of psychiatric disorder before self-harm was at least twice as prevalent than a subsequent diagnosis of psychiatric disorder where the prevalence ratio was the highest in patients with brain tumours (5.36, CI: 4.57-6.14). Younger individuals were more likely to be diagnosed with mental illness before the first self-harm episode. However, individuals from more deprived regions (2.46, CI: 2.32-2.60) and individuals with []4 pre-existing comorbidities (2.19, CI: 1.92-2.46) were less likely to be diagnosed with mental illness before self-harm. Patients with mental illness had a higher cumulative burden of self-harm events compared with matched controls. All mental illnesses were associated with an increased risk of subsequent self-harm, where the highest risk was observed within 12 months of the mental illness diagnosis. Risks of self-harm during the first year in matched cohorts were as follow: depression (adjusted HR 44.1, CI: 34.0-57.1), anxiety disorder (HR 21.1, CI: 16.4-27.0) and schizophrenia (HR 7.5, CI: 5.0-11.2). Patients with cancer and psychiatric disorder experienced excess years of life lost. Patients who harmed themselves were 6.8 times more likely to die of unnatural causes of death compared with controls within 12 months of self-harm (HR 6.8, CI: 4.3-10.7). The risk of unnatural death after 12 months was markedly lower (HR 2.0, CI: 1.5-2.7). Conclusions This study quantifies the total burden of psychiatric events and self-harm in patients with cancer. The cumulative burden of psychiatric events varies across cancer type, treatment regimen and chemotherapy type. Incident psychiatric disorder diagnoses were significantly associated with increased risk of subsequent self-harm, where risks varied across psychiatric diagnostic categories and follow-up periods. Patients who harm themselves experienced the highest risk of dying from unnatural deaths within the first year of self-harm.

INTRODUCTION: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of paediatric appendicitis has changed (open instead of laparoscopic appendectomy, antibiotic treatment). The number of complicated appendicitis cases increased worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric acute appendicitis: has there been more perforated cases? METHODS: Children operated because of acute appendicitis between 2012 and 2020 were studied. Cases from the year 2020 were analysed monthly. Patients were divided into perforated and non-perforated appendicitis groups according to their histological findings. COVID-19 status of patients in 2020 was studied. Chi2 test for trend and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In the study period, 1343 appendectomies were performed. The majority of our cases were non-perforated (1166/1343). The rate of perforated appendicitis cases has been increasing from 2015 (p = 0.0002). The number of perforated cases was higher in COVID-19 positive patients (5/8) then in negative ones (15/92) (p = 0.0075). DISCUSSION: In line with the international trend, more perforated appendicitis cases were treated in our departement in 2020. However, this increase started in 2015, and there is no correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic. The cause of the increased number of perforated cases in COVID-19 positive appendicitis patients is unknown. CONCLUSION: The causes of the high proportion of perforated cases in COVID-19 positive patients and the rising rate of perforated appendicitis cases since 2015 need further studies.

METHOD The study included 940 team athletes, 274 individual athletes, and 131 nonathlete controls aged 12-17 years. Demographic data were obtained with a form including questions about age, sex, sports type, and physical activity status (type, duration, and frequency) during the isolation period. Participants completed the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale-13, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. RESULTS Among participants, 88% did not meet the physical activity recommendations for children and adolescents, while 42.8% felt depressed. Depressive symptoms were present in 38.1% of boys and 59.7% of girls, with girls (6.4%) having higher posttraumatic stress symptoms than boys (3.5%). Among athletes, depressive and anxiety symptoms were lower compared with nonathlete controls (P < .01). Posttraumatic stress symptoms were lower among athletes than nonathlete controls for girls (team vs control, P = .006; individual vs control, P = .002) but similar for boys (P > .05). The depression (P = .518), state (P = .866), and trait anxiety (P = .507) symptoms were similar between team athletes and individual athletes. CONCLUSION Though adolescent athletes' depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were significantly lower than nonathlete controls, athletes also had high depression levels. These findings show the need to take precautions to protect the psychological health of not only nonathletes, but also athletes in the pandemic period.","output":"Effects of Long-Duration Home Isolation Linked to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Adolescent Athletes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The search for biomarkers that could help in predicting disease prognosis in the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is still high on the agenda. OBJECTIVE: To find out the efficacy of D-dimer and mean platelet volume (MPV) combination as a prognostic marker in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with bilateral infiltration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study design: Retrospective observational cohort. Patients who were presented to our hospital between March 16, 2020 and June 07, 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome of the study was specified as the need for intensive care, while the secondary outcomes were duration of treatment and hospitalization. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analyzes were carried out to assess the efficacy of D-dimer and MPV parameters as prognostic markers. RESULTS: Between the mentioned dates, 575 of 1,564 patients were found to be compatible with COVID-19, and the number of patients who were included in the study was 306. The number of patients who developed the need for intensive care was 40 (13.1%). For serum D-dimer levels in assessing the need for intensive care, the area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.707 (95% CI: 0.620C0.794). The AUC for MPV was 0.694 (95% CI: 0.585C0.803), when D-dimer was 1.0 mg/L. When patients with a D-dimer level of 1.0 mg/L were divided into two groups considering the MPV cut-off value as 8.1, the rate of intensive care transport was found to be significantly higher in patients with an MPV of 8.1 fL compared to those with an MPV of <8.1 fL (32.6 vs. 16.0%, p = 0.043). For the prognostic efficacy of the combination of D-dimer  1.0 mg/L and MPV  8.1 fL in determining the need for intensive care, following values were determined: sensitivity: 57.7%, specificity: 70.8%, positive predictive value (PPV): 32.0%, negative predictive value (NPV): 84.0%, and accuracy: 63.0%. When D-dimer was 1.0, the median duration of treatment in MPV <8.1 and 8.1 groups was 5.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 5.0C10.0] days for both groups (p = 0.64). The median length of hospital stay (LOS) was 7.0 (IQR: 5.0C10.5) days in the MPV <8.1 group, while it was 8.5 (IQR: 5.0C16.3) days in the MPV  8.1 group (p = 0.17). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients with a serum D-dimer level of at least 1.0 mg/L and radiological bilateral infiltration at hospitalization, if the MPV value is 8.1, we could predict the need for intensive care with moderate efficacy and a relatively high negative predictive value. However, no correlation could be found between this combined marker and the duration of treatment and the LOS.","output":"Use of Radiology, D-Dimer, and Mean Platelet Volume Combination as a Prognostic Marker in Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant extracts are rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, sesquiterpenes and triterpenes, with potential antiviral activities.

Plant-derived secondary metabolites may play key roles in preventing and counteracting the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections by inhibiting the activity of several viral proteins, in particular those involved in the virus entry into the host cells and its replication. In this study, by using different in vitro approaches, we uncovered the role of a pomegranate peel extract in attenuating the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and in inhibiting the activity of the virus 3CL protease. Although further studies will be determinant to assess the efficacy of this extract in vivo, our results open up new promising opportunities to employ natural extracts for the development of effective and innovative therapies in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A pomegranate peel extract as inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Spike binding to human ACE2 (in vitro): a promising source of novel antiviral drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Britain enforced a strict national lockdown, which is affecting the lives of millions, including dental professionals.

This thesis is fundamentally at odds with an overwhelming consensus in contemporary bioethics that the principle of respect for autonomy, while important in everyday clinical encounters, must be curtailed, constrained, or overridden by other principles in times of crisis. I contend that bioethicists have embraced an indefensibly thin notion of autonomy that uproots the concept from its foundations in Kantian ethics. According to this thin conception, respect for autonomy, if unconditioned by competing principles (beneficence, justice, non-maleficence) would give competent adults the right to do anything they desired to do so long as they satisfied certain baseline psychological conditions. I argue that the dominant principlist model of bioethical reasoning depends on this thin view of autonomy and show how it deprives us of powerful analytical tools that would help us to think seriously about the foundations of human rights, justice, and law.

In Japan, the first COVID-19 patient was identified on January 15, 2020. By June 30, the total number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 reached 18,000. The impact of molecular detection of pathogens is significant in acute-care settings where rapid and accurate diagnostic measures are critical for decisions in patient treatment and outcomes of infectious diseases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, such as quantitative PCR (qPCR), are the most established gene amplification tools and have a comprehensive range of clinical applications, including detecting a variety of pathogens, even novel agents causing emerging infections. Because SARS-CoV-2 contains a single-stranded RNA genome, reverse-transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) has been broadly employed for rapid and sensitive quantitative measurements of viral RNA copy numbers. The RT-qPCR method, however, still requires time-consuming reactions with two different enzymes in addition to isolation of RNA from patient samples, limiting the numbers of testing institutions for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Japan is known to have performed a relatively small number of PCR tests as well as confirmed cases among developed nations; as of June 30, 2020, approximately 390,000 people in Japan had undergone PCR tests. Given the devastating impact on medical services and the scale of demand for diagnostic testing of COVID-19, it has been proposed that academic settings such as basic research departments in university/college can be engaged in diagnosing, especially in university hospitals or academic medical centers. In collaboration with established diagnostic laboratories, academic facilities can divert their function to detecting virus from patients with suspected COVID-19, adopting existing specialized expertise in virus handling, molecular work, and data analysis. This in-house testing strategy facilitates the rapid diagnosing of thousands of samples per day and reduces sample turnaround time from 1 week to less than 24 h. This review provides an overview of the general principles, diagnostic value, and limitations of COVID-19 diagnosis platforms in Japan, in particular in-house testing at academic settings.","output":"Intensive diagnostic management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in academic settings in Japan: challenge and future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to 1) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; 2) longitudinal effects on wellbeing; and 3) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on wellbeing. METHODS: We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of wellbeing over five years (2015-2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n=1071, aged 60-71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26-April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 1) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. 2) Wellbeing remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. 3) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four wellbeing measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher wellbeing. DISCUSSION: In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their wellbeing as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower wellbeing. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic.

We outlined the delivery formation of intervention to evaluate the effectiveness and processes of major mental health improvements, including depression, burden, anxiety, and quality of life. Conclusions: In this study, tele-health intervention was shown to significantly lower depression and also lower the risk of mental health impairment.

PCOS. METHODS: Adolescent girls (n = 129), age range 14-19 years, were recruited in the cohort study. All participants were in the 4th or 5th year after menarche. Sixty-eight had menstrual irregularities, usually oligomenorrhea (OM), and 61 had regular menstruation (RM). AMH and A4 concentrations were measured. Hirsutism was recorded. Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) was evaluated by transabdominal pelvic ultrasonography. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) features were defined according to Rotterdam consensus criteria. RESULTS: AMH and A4 were significantly higher in adolescent girls with OM than in girls with RM (p < 0.05). A4 and body mass index (BMI) of adolescents with OM was significantly higher in those with hirsutism than those without hirsutism (p = 0.01 and 0.008, respectively). There was a positive correlation between A4 and BMI (r: 0.327, p < 0.01). Logistic regression showed that the frequency of OM in the presence of PCOM was 10.8 times (95% CI 2.04-12.09) compared to those without PCOM. The highest AMH concentrations were found in girls with OM, hirsutism, and PCOM (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: AMH and A4 are elevated in adolescents with oligomenorrhoea. High A4 is more prominent in the presence of hirsutism and is associated with increased BMI. PCOM, increases the likelihood of oligomenorrhea by about 10 times.

This map provides the structural and functional insights on the stability of LIM domains of CSRP3. Further, the sequence analysis delineates the eukaryotic CSRP3 protein orthologs which complements the mutational map, but provide limited information of amino acid exchanges.

One of highly destabilising mutationsL44P (also disease causing) and a neutral mutationL44M were further subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Methods: The Registry includes pts with 1) a confirmed COVID diagnosis (Dx) and 2) clinically evident cancer receiving Tx/supportive care or resected cancer on adjuvant Tx <12 mos since surgery. Practices report data on cancer Dx and Tx at COVID Dx, COVID symptoms, comorbidities, cancer/COVID Tx, and survival. Kaplan-Meier estimation provided 30- and 90- day mortality rate estimates for pts with COVID Dx before or since 6/1/20 within pt subgroups with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data submission cutoff for all practices was 10/24/20, except one that was 11/16/20. Results: This analysis reports on 453 pts with COVID Dx 3/5/20 to 10/22/20 who were on anticancer drug Tx for regional (9%) or metastatic (53%) solid tumors or hematologic cancers (38%) at COVID Dx. 38 practices entered data: health system-owned 51% of pts, privately-owned 25%, academic 24%. 53% of pts have 30 days followup or died 30 days from COVID Dx. Median age is 64 years;53% of pts are female;28% of pts are asymptomatic at COVID Dx. Multiple myeloma was most frequent cancer (17%). Allcause mortality rates (30 and 90 days) increased with pts' age at COVID Dx [Table]. No mortality difference was seen based on sex, race, or comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease). Pts with COVID Dx before June 1 had worse survival than pts diagnosed on/after June 1. Pts with B-cell malignancies had higher mortality rates than pts with solid tumors. Conclusions: Severity of COVID illness and mortality were greater for patients with COVID Dx pre-June 1 than on/after June 1. Differences on/after June 1 may be attributed to improvements in COVID management, higher COVID testing rates, and more asymptomatic pts diagnosed. Variations in COVID-19 pt populations over time due to these changes should be considered when analyzing and interpreting pandemic data. Cancer pts with ed age and B-cell cancers are at greatest risk of death but mortality rates for all groups advanced age and B-cell cancers are at greatestrisk of death but mortality rates for all groups(except those admitted to ICU) improved after6/1/2020.","output":"Mortality risk for patients undergoing cancer treatment who acquire SARS-CoV-2: ASCO registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Laboratory testing and the measurement of appropriate biomarkers play a critical role in managing patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), allowing for disease diagnosis, monitoring progression, prognostication, prediction of treatment response, and risk stratification.

Russia is among the countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, making it a potential hotspot for emergence of novel variants. Here, we show that among the globally significant variants of concern, alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) or gamma (P.1), none have been sampled in Russia before January 2021. Instead, between summer 2020 and spring 2021, the epidemic in Russia has been characterized by the spread of two lineages that are rare elsewhere: B.1.1.317 and a sublineage of B.1.1 including B.1.1.397 (hereafter, B.1.1.397+). Their frequency has increased in different parts of Russia. Mutational composition and frequency dynamics suggest that B.1.1.317 and B.1.1.397+ may be more transmissible than the previously predominant B.1.1. On top of these lineages, in January 2021, B.1.1.7 emerged in Russia, reaching the frequency of 17.4% (95% C.I.: 12.0%-24.4%) in March 2021. Additionally, we identify three novel distinct lineages, AT.1, B.1.1.524 and B.1.1.525, that have started to spread, together reaching the frequency of 11.8% (95% C.I.: 7.5%-18.1%) in March 2021. These lineages carry combinations of several notable mutations, including the S:E484K mutation of concern, deletions at a recurrent deletion region of the spike glycoprotein (S:140-142, S:144 or S:136-144), and nsp6:106-108 (also known as ORF1a:3675-3677). Community-based PCR testing indicates that these variants have continued to spread in April 2021, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 reaching 21.7% (95% C.I.: 12.3%-35.6%), and the joint frequency of B.1.1.524 and B.1.1.525, 15.2% (95% C.I.: 7.6%-28.2%).

Scientists have found a relatively new way to detect influenza outbreaks early thus reducing the burden of disease by early intervention. This new technology is a social network information system which uses Facebook or Twitter data to detect potential influenza cases. Such system is good to be developed by the Malaysian government as it can detect influenza outbreaks three weeks earlier than the normal pathway. However, to implement this we require good evidence that the development will be accepted by potential users. OBJECTIVE This study was looking at the acceptance towards using social network information system among public health workers. MATERIALS AND METHOD This study was done on 205 Malaysian One Health University Network (MyOHUN) members through email and physical survey. RESULTS Results show that 62.4% public health workers accepted the use technology. The acceptance was shown to be associated with performance expectancy (p<0.05). However, unlike the very famous Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, the acceptance of social network information system was not associated with effort expectancy, social factors, facilitating conditions and socio-demographic factors. Therefore, it is suggested that social network information system be developed by the authorities in Malaysia, and be developed in a way that the system could strongly increase performance in detection of outbreak earlier than the current normal pathways. As such the system to be accepted and used, it must be sensitive, specific and be able to detect influenza outbreak early CONCLUSION: The development of social network information system is feasible as it is highly accepted and it's potential to improve early detection of influenza outbreak.","output":"Acceptance towards social network information system for earlier detection of Influenza outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence is promoting the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads.

Methods and Results The targeted carotid files from the prospective NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) registry (2011-2013) comprised the derivation population. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated predictors of a 30-day adverse event (stroke, myocardial infarction, or death), the effect estimates of which were used to build a weighted predictive scale that was validated using the 2014 to 2015 NSQIP registry release. A total of 10 766 and 8002 patients were included in the derivation and the validation populations, in whom 4.0% and 3.7% developed an adverse event, respectively. The NSQIP registry CEA scale included 14 variables; the highest points were allocated for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, high-risk cardiac physiological characteristics, admission source other than home, an emergent operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification IV to V, modified Rankin Scale score 2, and presentation with a stroke. NSQIP registry CEA score was predictive of an adverse event (concordance=0.67), stroke or death (concordance=0.69), mortality (concordance=0.76), an extended hospitalization (concordance=0.73), and a nonroutine discharge (concordance=0.83) in the validation population, as well as among symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups (P<0.001).

Furthermore, studies on the signal pathways that activate NF-B led to the discovery of TRAF family proteins with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which function downstream of the receptor. This discovery led to the proposal of an entirely new signaling mechanism concept, wherein K63-ubiquitin chains act as a scaffold for the signaling complex to activate downstream kinases.

METHODS: This single-centre retrospective cohort study analysed presentations, incidence of mechanical complications, and mortality in patients with STEMI before and after a state of emergency was declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Japanese government on 7 April 2020. RESULTS: We analysed 359 patients with STEMI hospitalised before the declaration and 63 patients hospitalised after the declaration. The proportion of patients with late presentation was significantly higher after the declaration than before (25.4% vs 14.2%, p=0.03). The incidence of late presentation was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than before (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 2.41; 95% CI, 1.37 to 4.05; p=0.001, even after adjusting for month (IRR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.33 to 5.13; p<0.01).

However, understanding of the role of respiratory tract microbiota in the clinical course of pediatric CAP is limited. METHODS: We sought to compare microbiota profiles in induced sputum and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) samples from children and to identify microbiota profiles associated with CAP severity. We used 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and several measures of microbiota profiles, including principal component analysis (PCA), to describe the respiratory microbiota in 383 children, 6 months to <18 years, hospitalized with CAP. We examined associations between induced sputum and NP/OP microbiota profiles and CAP severity (hospital length of stay and intensive care unit admission) using logistic regression. RESULTS: Relative abundance of bacterial taxa differed in induced sputum and NP/OP samples. In children 6 months to < 5 years, the sputum PCA factor with high relative abundance of Actinomyces, Veillonella, Rothia, and Lactobacillales was associated with decreased odds of length of stay  4 days [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.69; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.48C0.99]. The sputum factor with high relative abundance of Haemophilus and Pasteurellaceae was associated with increased odds of intensive care unit admission [aOR 1.52; 95 % CI 1.02C2.26]. In children 5 to < 18 years, the sputum factor with high relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteriodales, Lactobacillales, and Prevotella was associated with increased odds of length of stay  4 days [aOR 1.52; 95 % CI 1.02C2.26].

Increased importance in detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated due to the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). In this study we evaluated if a commercially available real-time SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay can identify B.1.1.7 lineage samples by a specific N gene dropout or Ct value shift compared to the S or RdRP gene. Methods. Patients samples with confirmed B.1.1.7 variant by whole-genome sequencing and variant-specific PCR (n=48) and non-B.1.1.7 samples (n=53) were tested by the Allplex SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV PCR assay for presence of S, RdRP and N gene of SARS CoV-2. The N gene coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with and without D3L mutation (specific for B.1.1.7) were cloned into pCR-TOPO vectors and Allplex SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV PCR assay was performed. Results. All studied B.1.1.7 patient samples showed significantly higher Ct values (delta 6-10, N-gene dropout on Ct values >29) in the N gene compared to the respective values of S and RdRP gene. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis resulted in 100% sensitivity and specificity for delta Ct N/RdRP and delta Ct N/S. As a result of the reversed genetic experiments we found also the shift in Ct values for the 3L variant N-gene. Conclusions. N gene dropout or Ct value shift is specific for B.1.1.7 positive samples using the Allplex SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV PCR assay. This approach can be used as a rapid tool for B.1.1.7 detection in single assay high throughput diagnostics.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 N gene dropout and N gene Ct value shift as indicator for the presence of B.1.1.7 lineage in a widely used commercial multiplex PCR assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundPoint of Care testing for virology is readily available in PICU and results are available within 45 minutes.

We aim to validate it, making it easier to cohort patients and allow de-escalation of PPE and red zones at the earliest opportunity.MethodsAll medical staff performing bronchioalveolar lavage on patients in PICU were requested to split the sample obtained;one to run one through the POC machine and the rest to be sent off to the lab. A folder was placed by the machine to insert an ID label in when a POC sample was run using a BAL sample. 19 samples were analysed over a four month period between October 2020 and January 2021. The results obtained by the point of care machine was compared to the lab results for both Sats-Cov-2 and for other virology PCR.ResultsIn total 89.4% of the samples showed correlation in the results obtained by the POC machine for both covid 19 and other virology. With regards to Sars-Cov-2 testing 15 of the 19 samples were both negative on point of care testing and on lab testing. The remaining four samples had not been tested by the lab for covid 19 PCR C it is assumed that no request form was completed by medical staff to request covid 19 PCR to be run on the sample. 5.2% of the samples analysed for virology PCR showed that the lab was more sensitive in detecting viral loads at lower levels. 5.2% of the results obtained for virology couldnt be correlated as the POC machine didnt test for the organism detected.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes in patients undergoing bariatric surgery with class I obesity, a class that does not fall into current indications. SETTING: University Hospital. METHODS: De-identified records from a clinic system's Electronic Health Record database were accessed to identify adult patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (n = 566) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (n = 730). Patients were compared in terms of resolution of co-morbidities and weight loss outcomes at 3 years following surgery. A mixed effects model was used, adjusting for the type of surgery, the number of quarters after the surgery when the averaged measurements were taken, and the interaction between these two variables. RESULTS: Patients lost up to 20% of their initial body mass index (BMI). Being of younger age, female, and having an obesity-related co-morbidity were associated with greater weight loss. At around 2 years after the surgery, the likelihood of being in remission from type 2 diabetes reached 45%. Remission probabilities for hypertension are 60% for RYGB and 50% for SG, 3 years after the surgery. On the other hand, the probabilities of remission from hyperlipidemia are close to 50% and 25% for RYGB and SG at 2 years. There was no difference between the BMI trajectories and remission from type 2 diabetes (T2D) when comparing the 2 groups.

Many larger cities have identified the potential impacts of different climate change adaptation scenarios. However, their smaller and medium-sized counterparts are often not able to address climate risks effectively due to a lack of necessary resources. Since a large number of cities worldwide are indeed small and medium-sized, this lack of preparedness represents a crucial weakness in global response systems. A promising approach to tackling this issue is to establish regional municipal networks. Yet, how might a regional network for small and medium-sized cities be systematically designed and further developed? Focussing on the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, we have explored this question by applying a participatory action research approach. As part of our research, we established a regional network framework for small and medium-sized cities. The framework supports small and medium-sized cities in identifying key regional actors, while taking local and regional contextual factors into account.

COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure. Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death. To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease. Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body. The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects. Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD. This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-dependent mechanisms and the potential interaction with ACE2 expression and cell surface localization. We aim to provide a list of potential treatment options and a better understanding of why CVD is a high risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and further discuss the acute as well as long-term cardiac consequences.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2-dependent implications on the cardiovascular system: From basic science to clinical implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still spread and has made a severe public health threat around the world.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work is to analyze the transition of the epidemic from sub-exponential to exponential transmission in Chennai metro-zone and to analyze the probability of SARS-CoV-2 secondary infections while availing the public transport systems in the city. METHODS: A single geographical zone \\"Chennai-Metro-Merge\\" was constructed by combining Chennai district with three bordering districts. Sub-exponential and exponential models were developed to analyze and predict the progression of COVID-19 epidemic. Probabilistic models were applied to assess the probability of secondary infections while availing the public transport after the release of the lockdown. RESULTS: The model predicted that transition from sub-exponential to exponential transmission occurs around eighth week after the reporting a cluster of cases.

Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention. METHODS: Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it. RESULTS: Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership16.4% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions.

Based on a series of in-depth interviews with relevant public and private stakeholders and two expert meetings, we identify the main bottlenecks and constraints. In order to understand the complexity of international rail transport, we have divided the existing bottlenecks into four groups corresponding to four layers of the rail transport system: mobility services, transport services, traffic services, and the physical and digital infrastructure.

Independent, well-powered studies could further our understanding of this association. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether low levels of vitamin D are associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, an indicator of previous infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a cohort study of employees and spouses who elected to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG as part of an annual employer-sponsored health screening program conducted in August to November 2020. This program includes commonly assessed demographic, biometric, and laboratory variables, including total vitamin D measurement. Baseline (prepandemic) levels of vitamin D and potential confounders were obtained from screening results from the previous year (September 2019 to January 2020). Data analysis was performed from December 2020 to March 2021. EXPOSURES: Low total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, defined as either less than 20 ng/mL or less than 30 ng/mL. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as determined with US Food and Drug Administration emergency useCauthorized assays. The association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with vitamin D levels was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score analyses. RESULTS: The 18 148 individuals included in this study had test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 2020 and vitamin D levels from the prepandemic and pandemic periods.

It has been suggested that being in quarantine is associated with the development of symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The present study aims to explore the factors associated with the development of PTSD in a post-quarantine context due to COVID-19 in medical students. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the factors associated with the development of post-quarantine PTSD symptoms in medical students from a Peruvian university. METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study. The objective will be developed after the lifting of the quarantine in Peru. Medical students enrolled during the 2020-01 academic cycle of the Peruvian University of Applied Sciences will be included. To collect the outcome variable (PTSD), the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) will be used. The associated factors will be collected through a form that will be validated by experts and piloted in the field. The crude and adjusted coefficients will be calculated, using bivariate and multivariate linear regression models, respectively. We will use the manual forward selection technique to obtain a final model with minimally sufficient fit. After each model comparison and decision, multicollinearity will be evaluated with the variance inflation factor and matrix of independent variables. RESULTS: Not having health insurance, having relatives or close friends who contracted the disease and having a lower family income are factors associated with PTSD in the post-quarantine context of the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students at a Peruvian university. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical evaluation is important for medical students with a high probability of having PTSD symptoms.

To this purpose, 319 informal caregivers (149 in Germany and 173 in Italy) were surveyed online in 2020C2021. A logistic regression analysis was performed by country, to obtain an adjusted estimate of the risk of worsening of caregivers health. This risk increased by 42% for German caregivers compared to Italian ones, despite the former receiving more formal services.

SUBJECTS: Twenty-six adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients; 33 adult noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients, matched for age, sex, and disease severity, constituted the control group. All patients were steroid-free. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Glucocorticoid receptor alpha, glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper expression, and serum cortisol were measured on ICU admission.

With our paper we are the first to conduct an empirical analysis of employers' increasing flexibility requirements in the course of advancing digitalization, based on a representative business survey, the IAB Job Vacancy Survey. We combine establishment-level data from the survey and occupation-specific characteristics from other sources and apply non-linear random effects estimations. According to employers' assessments, office and secretarial occupations are undergoing the largest changes in terms of flexibility requirements, followed by other occupations that are highly relevant in the context of AI: occupations in company organization and strategy, vehicle/aerospace/shipbuilding technicians and occupations in insurance and financial services. The increasing requirements we observe most frequently are those concerning demands on employees' self-organization, although short-term working-time flexibility and workplace flexibility also play an important role. The estimation results show that the occupational characteristics, independently of the individual employer, play a major role for increasing flexibility requirements. For example, occupations with a larger share of routine cognitive activities (which in the literature are usually more closely associated with artificial intelligence than others) reveal a significantly higher probability of increasing flexibility demands, specifically with regard to the employees' self-organization. This supports the argument that AI changes above all work content and work processes. For the average age of the workforce and the unemployment rate in an occupation we find significantly negative effects. At the establishment level the share of female employees plays a significant negative role.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the risk factors of anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 449 otolaryngology healthcare workers participated in the study. Of all the participants, 131 (29.18%) had anxiety symptoms. Compared with doctors, nurses were at a higher risk for anxiety (OR = 2.162, 95% CI 1.311-3.566). Participants who often suspected self-infection (OR = 4.239, 95% CI 1.647-10.909) or family member infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (OR = 4.485, 95% CI 1.511-13.313) were more likely to develop anxiety than those who never. The subjects who had colleagues diagnosed with COVID-19 were more vulnerable to anxiety (OR = 2.014, 95% CI 1.205-3.366). Respondents working in infectious isolation wards had a 3.522-fold increased risk of anxiety compared to those on leave (OR = 3.522, 95% CI 1.634-7.593). CONCLUSION: Some otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province experienced anxiety during the epidemic, but most of them did not receive treatment. The healthcare providers themselves should be informed about and aware of their own mental health, and should be given support as appropriate.

RNA molecules encode information both in their primary sequences and in complex structures that form when an RNA folds back on itself. From the time of discovery of mRNA in the late 1950s until quite recently, we had only a rudimentary understanding of RNA structure across vast regions of most messenger and noncoding RNAs. This deficit is now rapidly being addressed, especially by selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry, mutational profiling (MaP), and closely related platform technologies that, collectively, create chemical microscopes for RNA. These technologies make it possible to interrogate RNA structure, quantitatively, at nucleotide resolution, and at large scales, for entire mRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and viral RNA genomes. By applying comprehensive structure probing to diverse problems, we and others are showing that control of biological function mediated by RNA structure is ubiquitous across prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.Work over the past decade using SHAPE-based analyses has clarified key principles. First, the method of RNA structure probing matters. SHAPE-MaP, with its direct and one-step readout that probes nearly every nucleotide by reaction at the 2'-hydroxyl, gives a more detailed and accurate readout than alternatives. Second, comprehensive chemical probing is essential. Focusing on fragments of large RNAs or using meta-gene or statistical analyses to compensate for sparse data sets misses critical features and often yields structure models with poor predictive power. Finally, every RNA has its own internal structural personality. There are myriad ways in which RNA structure modulates sequence accessibility, protein binding, translation, splice-site choice, phase separation, and other fundamental biological processes. In essentially every instance where we have applied rigorous and quantitative SHAPE technologies to study RNA structure-function interrelationships, new insights regarding biological regulatory mechanisms have emerged. RNA elements with more complex higher-order structures appear more likely to contain high-information-content clefts and pockets that bind small molecules, broadly informing a vigorous field of RNA-targeted drug discovery.The broad implications of this collective work are twofold. First, it is long past time to abandon depiction of large RNAs as simple noodle-like or gently flowing molecules. Instead, we need to emphasize that nearly all RNAs are punctuated with distinctive internal structures, a subset of which modulate function in profound ways. Second, structure probing should be an integral component of any effort that seeks to understand the functional nexuses and biological roles of large RNAs.","output":"SHAPE Directed Discovery of New Functions in Large RNAs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smart cities need technologies that can be really applied to raise the quality of life and environment.

METHODS: After receiving ethical approval, data was collected through an online questionnaire among students from one of the largest Universities in Greece. Descriptive statistics as well as bi- and multivariate analyses were conducted using SPSS. RESULTS: 604 university students (mean age 24.3, 73.3% females) completed the survey. 28% indicated that they found it very difficult/ difficult to find the exact information they were looking for, 20.4% to make a choice across all information accessed, and 45.1% stated it is very difficult/ difficult to decide whether the information was reliable or not.

Out-of-pocket healthcare spending thus remains a potential source of financial hardship for veterans. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aimed to expand health insurance access, but its effect on veterans financial risk protection has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ACA implementation was associated with changes in veterans risk of catastrophic health expenditures, and to characterize drivers of catastrophic health spending among veterans post-ACA. DESIGN: Using multivariable linear probability regression, we examined changes in likelihood of catastrophic health spending after ACA implementation, stratifying by age (18C64 vs 65+), household income tercile, and payer (VHA vs non-VHA). Among veterans with catastrophic spending post-ACA, we evaluated sources of out-of-pocket spending. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of 13,030 veterans aged 18+ from the 2010 to 2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. INTERVENTION: ACA implementation, January 1, 2014. MAIN MEASURES: Likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures, defined as household out-of-pocket spending exceeding 10% of household income. KEY RESULTS: Among veterans aged 18C64, ACA implementation was associated with a 26% decrease in likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures (absolute change, ?1.4 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, ?2.6 to ?0.2; p=0.03), which fell from 5.4% pre-ACA to 3.9% post-ACA. This was driven by a 38% decrease in catastrophic spending among veterans with non-VHA coverage (absolute change, ?1.8pp; 95% CI, ?3.0 to ?0.6; p=0.003). In contrast, catastrophic expenditure rates among veterans aged 65+ remained high, at 13.0% pre- and 12.5% post-ACA. Major drivers of veterans spending post-ACA include dental care, prescription drugs, and home care. CONCLUSIONS: ACA implementation was associated with reduced household catastrophic health expenditures for younger but not older veterans.

The current study investigated whether socioeconomic disparities remained in COVID-19 health outcomes under universal health coverage and sought to determine which factor exerted the greatest effect on disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.Methods: This retrospective, observational study included all 7,590 confirmed COVID-19 patients who tested positive in South Korea through May 15, 2020. We used the official medical database, released from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea. Socioeconomic status was estimated by insurance type (National Health Insurance Service [NHIS] beneficiaries and Medical Aid [MA] recipients). Incidence (per 1,000,000), mortality rate (per 1,000,000), and case fatality rate were calculated. To determine the factors associated with incidence and case fatality ratio, multivariable logistic regressions were performed at the national and regional levels.Findings: Nationwide, incidence of COVID-19 was 1444 per 1,000,000, mortality rate was 43 per 1,000,000, and case fatality ratio was 30%. MA recipients had higher incidence (4243 vs 136.3), mortality rate (283 vs 36), and case fatality ratio (67 vs 27) than NHIS beneficiaries. After adjustment, older age, male sex, hypertension, higher Charlson comorbidity index score, and region were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 case fatality.Interpretation: We found socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 related health outcomes in incidence and fatality, despite universal health coverage.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data of 356 patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test who received treatment between June 2020 and August 2020 in our hospital were prospectively evaluated after the study was approved by the relevant ethics committee. RESULTS: Of the 356 patients included in the study, 47 under the age of 18 years were excluded due to their unreliable examination and anamnesis findings. In addition, seven patients that died while in hospital were excluded from the study due to the lack of examination and survey records during their hospitalization. The data of the remaining 302 patients were statistically analyzed. Symptoms of cranial nerve involvement were observed in 135 patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus commonly results in cranial nerve symptoms. The fact that these findings are more common and severe in COVID-19 than previous SARS and MERS outbreaks suggests that it has a more neurotrophic and more aggressive neuroinvasion.

In some patients, biopsies have revealed collapsing glomerulopathy, a distinct form of glomerular injury that has been associated with other viruses, including HIV. Previous patient reports have described patients of African ancestry who developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and AKI early in the course of disease. METHODS In this patient series, we identified six patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), AKI, and nephrotic-range proteinuria. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined biopsy specimens from one transplanted kidney and five native kidneys. Three of the six patients underwent genetic analysis of APOL1, the gene encoding the APOL1 protein, from DNA extracted from peripheral blood. In addition, we purified genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue and performed APOL1 genotype analysis of one of the native biopsies and the donor kidney graft. RESULTS All six patients were of recent African ancestry. They developed COVID-19-associated AKI with podocytopathy, collapsing glomerulopathy, or both. Patients exhibited generally mild respiratory symptoms, and no patient required ventilator support. Genetic testing performed in three patients confirmed high-risk APOL1 genotypes. One APOL1 high-risk patient developed collapsing glomerulopathy in the engrafted kidney, which was transplanted from a donor who carried a low-risk APOL1 genotype; this contradicts current models of APOL1-mediated kidney injury, and suggests that intrinsic renal expression of APOL1 may not be the driver of nephrotoxicity and specifically, of podocyte injury.

In the past two decades, electrochemical techniques have been used to investigate EET in a wide range of microbes, with emphasis on dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria, such as Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, as model organisms. However, due to the typically bulk nature of these techniques, they are unable to reveal the subpopulation variation in EET or link the observed electrochemical currents to energy gain by individual cells, thus overlooking the potentially complex spatial patterns of activity in bioelectrochemical systems.

Using a fluorescent membrane potential indicator during in vivo single-cell-level fluorescence microscopy in a bioelectrochemical reactor, we demonstrate that membrane potential strongly correlates with EET. Increasing electrode potential and associated EET current leads to more negative membrane potential. This EET-induced membrane hyperpolarization is spatially limited to cells in contact with the electrode and within a near-electrode zone (<30 m) where the hyperpolarization decays with increasing cell-electrode distance.

The outbreak, confirmed on the New Years Eve 2020, has known no boundaries since then. The number has surpassed that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and is uninterruptedly escalating. Being an RNA virus, it has a propensity to mutate due to the low proofreading capacity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Step-wise mutations have led to the gradual spillover of virus and after crossing the inter-species interface, the virus has adapted itself for a stable human-to-human transmission. The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can prove deadlier if the so-called super-spreading events emerge with time. Recent research has shown the maximum homology of 99% of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins associated coronavirus, owing to which these can serve as potential intermediate host.

METHODS Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HFL1) were treated with increasing concentrations of lipopolysaccharide at 5, 10, or 20 g/mL to induce inflammatory and apoptotic injuries. Expression of PTPRO was detected by western blot. Inflammation and apoptosis were assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry assays, respectively. RESULTS Lipopolysaccharide induced decreased cell viability, and increased inflammation and apoptosis in HFL1. PTPRO was upregulated in HFL1 post lipopolysaccharide treatment, and silencing of PTPRO enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced cell viability of HFL1, and suppressed the inflammation and apoptosis.

Overexpression of PTPRO upregulated protein expression of TLR4 and p-p65 in lipopolysaccharide-induced HFL1, while knockdown of PTPRO reduced the level of p-IB to downregulate levels of TLR4 and p-p65. CONCLUSION PTPRO contributed to pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced HFL1 through activation of TLR4/NF-B signaling.","output":"PTPRO activates TLR4/NF-B signaling to intensify lipopolysaccharide-induced pneumonia cell injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delgado talks about radical mutual aid, international working-class struggle and antiracist organizing among others.

The aim of this study is to quantify and characterise changes in acute hospital healthcare utilisation in Ireland during the first wave of COVID-19 to inform healthcare system planning and recovery. Methods: A retrospective, population-based, interrupted time-trend study was conducted using two national datasets, Patient Experience Time (PET) and Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE). The study period was 6th January to 5th July 2020. Results: Comparison between time periods pre- and post-onset of the COVID-19 pandemic within 2020 showed there were 81,712 fewer Emergency Department (ED) presentations (-18.8%), 19,692 fewer admissions from ED (-17.4%) and 210,357 fewer non-COVID-19 hospital admissions (-35.0%) than expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity. Reductions were greatest at the peak of population-level restrictions, at extremes of age and for elective admissions. In the period immediately following the first wave, acute hospital healthcare utilisation remained below pre-COVID-19 levels, however, there were increases in emergency alcohol-related admissions (Rate Ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.03, 1.43, p-value 0.016), admissions with self-harm (Rate Ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.01, 1.91, p-value 0.043) and mental health admissions (Rate Ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03, 1.60, p-value 0.028). Discussion: While public health implications of delayed and lost care will only become fully apparent over time, recovery planning must begin immediately. In the short-term, backlogs in care need to be managed and population health impacts of COVID-19 and associated restrictions, particularly in relation to mental health and alcohol, need to be addressed through strong public health and health system responses. In the long-term, COVID-19 highlights health system weakness and is an opportunity to progress health system reform to deliver a universal, high-quality, sustainable and resilient health system, capable of meeting population health needs and responding to future pandemics.","output":"The public health and health system implications of changes in the utilisation of acute hospital care in Ireland during the first wave of COVID-19: Lessons for recovery planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis\\\\Viren wurden und werden dadurch gefunden und letztlich auch benannt, dass man die infekti?sen Agenzien C meist in Form ihrer Nukleins?uren C im Blut von Patienten mit Leberentzndungen nachweist.

Characterizing return to baseline health among outpatients with milder COVID-19 illness is important for understanding the full spectrum of COVID-19-associated illness and tailoring public health messaging, interventions, and policy. During April 15-June 25, 2020, telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of adults aged &#8805;18 years who had a first positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at an outpatient visit at one of 14 U.S. academic health care systems in 13 states. Interviews were conducted 14-21 days after the test date. Respondents were asked about demographic characteristics, baseline chronic medical conditions, symptoms present at the time of testing, whether those symptoms had resolved by the interview date, and whether they had returned to their usual state of health at the time of interview. Among 292 respondents, 94% (274) reported experiencing one or more symptoms at the time of testing; 35% of these symptomatic respondents reported not having returned to their usual state of health by the date of the interview (median = 16 days from testing date), including 26% among those aged 18-34 years, 32% among those aged 35-49 years, and 47% among those aged &#8805;50 years. Among respondents reporting cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath at the time of testing, 43%, 35%, and 29%, respectively, continued to experience these symptoms at the time of the interview. These findings indicate that COVID-19 can result in prolonged illness even among persons with milder outpatient illness, including young adults. Effective public health messaging targeting these groups is warranted. Preventative measures, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and the consistent and correct use of face coverings in public, should be strongly encouraged to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Symptom Duration and Risk Factors for Delayed Return to Usual Health Among Outpatients with COVID-19 in a Multistate Health Care Systems Network - United States, March-June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pathological involvement of the heart is frequent in Sars-Coronavirus-2 infection (Covid-19) with various clinical and echocardiographic manifestations during the course of the disease. CASE SUMMARY: A 69 years old female patient with severe Covid-19 related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) undergoing mechanical ventilation developed acute left ventricular dysfunction, that successfully improved with vasoactive therapy. After 5 days, she suddenly developed hemodynamic instability due to acute onset of pericardial effusion, which required emergency pericardiocentesis. Ultrasound guided parasternal pericardiocentesis with high frequency linear probe and lateral-to-medial in-plane approach was performed by inserting a central venous catheter using a Seldinger technique. 700 ml of serous fluid was drained resolving the acute critical state. DISCUSSION: Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade is a rare manifestation of Covid-19. Despite the diffusion of echocardiography, emergency cardiac procedures could be particularly difficult to be performed in a pandemic scenario of limited resources and the heterogeneous skills of the professional figures involved in the management of Covid-19 patients. The spread of expertise in ultrasound guided vascular cannulation makes this approach attractive for anesthesiologists, emergency medicine and critical care specialists too. Furthermore in this pericardiocentesis technique, the high frequency linear probe adds optimal spatial resolution to maintain a close control of the needles direction. However the need of a good parasternal view and a deep ultrasound knowledge are crucial to avoid iatrogenic complications. In conclusion, ultrasound guided lateral-to-medial parasternal pericardiocentesis with high frequency linear probe is an alternative to treat potential lethal acute hemodynamic instability due to cardiac tamponade.","output":"Ultrasound emergency lateral-to-medial parasternal pericardiocentesis with high frequency probe in Covid-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW While the risks of transfusion-transmitted human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and human T-cell leukemia virus I/II continue to decrease, additional threats to transfusion safety are posed by emerging \\"new\\" infectious diseases.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 319 patients with systemic autoimmune diseases (92% females; 49.5% of patients in the 31C50 years age category). The vaccine literacy levels were determined using the Health Literacy about Vaccination in adulthood in Italian (HLVa-IT). Sociodemographic characteristics including gender, age, country and area of residence, civil status, socioeconomic status, educational attainment and occupational status were evaluated. The mean vaccine literacy functional and interactive-critical scores were 2.59  0.74 and 3.07  0.60, respectively. The vaccine literacy interactive-critical score was higher in females than in males (p = 0.048). Interactive-critical scores were associated with the area of residence, civil status and socioeconomic status, with the highest score in urban area of  100.000 inhabitants (p = 0.045), in widow patients (p = 0.023) and in patients with high socioeconomic status (p = 0.018).

DISCUSSION: The article describes operational experiences in different settings and reflects on important themes and implications for future practice. The authors use a reflective model to share perspectives of leading research delivery roles in geographically and organisationally different settings. A patient's perspective was included from the outset of the reflective process. Delegates at an interactive masterclass conference in April 2021 also contributed their experiences. Seven themes characterise the research teams' response to the pandemic: prioritising, team-building, protection, limitation of autonomy, reduced bureaucracy, collaboration and transformation of process. Balance through compassionate leadership underpinned by ethically grounded decision-making was a theme throughout. CONCLUSION: Implicitly held, tacit knowledge progressed to explicit knowledge, formalising the research teams' responses to the pandemic partly into codified learning. The authors characterise the experience as an 'operational balancing act', whereby significant innovations were integrated into working practices and research delivery. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The pandemic demonstrated what research progress is possible when all resources are diverted to one novel virus. The value of research teams was elevated through treatment and vaccine trials and the contribution of those involved to patient care.

We explore crucial epidemiological parameters driving seasonal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in secondary schools and assess various infection control interventions over a 2.5-year time frame. Methods: We developed an agent-based model parameterised with data from secondary schools in the Netherlands. We modelled the circulation of Omicron assuming a stable introduction rate of infections and accounted for uncertainty in epidemiological parameters describing virus transmissibility, susceptibility to reinfection, vaccine immune escape, and waning of sterilising immunity. We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 health burden defined as number of symptomatic student days. We further evaluated the cost-benefit (number of prevented infected students per absent student) for reactive quarantine interventions, regular screening using antigen tests, and annual booster vaccinations. Findings: Durability of sterilising immunity is a key parameter that governs temporal SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns in secondary schools. Our model predicts pronounced within-school seasonal patterns with dominant autumn outbreaks and smaller winter outbreaks and a maximum prevalence of 2.9% (95% CI: 0.7%-6.6%) symptomatic students during infection peaks. Regular screening and annual booster vaccination may reduce the health burden up to 15% (95% CI: 1.5%-27.8%) and have a higher cost-benefit ratio than reactive quarantine interventions (reduction: 4.3%; 95% CI: -10.1% to 17.6%). Interpretation: Immunity waning will determine the intensity and pattern of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in secondary schools in the medium-term future.

METHODS: A questionnaire was shared on social networks or via email by the authors and by Anaesthesia and/or Critical Care societies from France, Switzerland, Belgium, Brazil, and Portugal. Intensivists and anaesthetists involved in COVID-19 ICU care were invited to answer 14 questions about haemodynamic monitoring and management. RESULTS: Globally, 1000 questionnaires were available for analysis. Responses came mainly from Europe (n = 460) and America (n = 434). According to respondents, a majority of COVID-19 ICU patients frequently or very frequently received continuous vasopressor support (56%) and had an echocardiography performed (54%). Echocardiography revealed a normal cardiac function, a hyperdynamic state (43%), hypovolaemia (22%), a left ventricular dysfunction (21%) and a right ventricular dilation (20%). Fluid responsiveness was frequently assessed (84%), mainly using echo (62%), and cardiac output was measured in 69%, mostly with echo as well (53%). Venous oxygen saturation was frequently measured (79%), mostly from a CVC blood sample (94%). Tissue perfusion was assessed biologically (93%) and clinically (63%). Pulmonary oedema was detected and quantified mainly using echo (67%) and chest X-ray (61%). CONCLUSION: Our survey confirms that vasopressor support is not uncommon in COVID-19 ICU patients and suggests that different cardiac function phenotypes may be observed.

Development of effective vaccines against the virus is still being encouraged such as multi-epitope vaccines designed from the components of SARS-CoV-2 including its spike, nucleocapsid and ORF1a proteins. Since the addition of adjuvants including HABA protein and L7/L12 ribosomal are considered helpful to increase the effectiveness of the designed vaccine, we proposed to design multiepitope vaccines by two different adjuvants. Methods: We used the IEDB server to predict BCL and TCL epitopes that were characterized using online tools including VaxiJen, AllPred and IL-10 Prediction. The selected epitopes were further constructed into multiepitope vaccines. We also added two different adjuvants to the vaccine components in order to increase the effectiveness of the vaccines. The 3D-structured vaccines were built using trRosetta. They were further docked with different Toll-like-receptors (TLR 3, 4 and 8) and the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 using ClusPro, PatchDock and refined by FireDock. All structures were visualized by USCF Chimera and PyMOL. Results: In this study, we succeeded in designing two different candidate vaccines by the addition of HABA protein and L7/L12 ribosomal as adjuvants. The two vaccines were almost equally good in terms of their physicochemical properties and characteristics. Likewise, their strong interactions with TLR3 4, 8 and ACE2 show the lowest energy level of both was estimated at more than-1,000. Interactions of vaccines with ACE2 and TLRs are essential for activation of immune responses and production of antibodies.

Nursing professionals (NP) represent over half of HCWs in Brazil, a country with high morbidity and mortality from covid-19, above all in 2021. The absenteeism and death of nursing professionals due to covid-19 have a major impact on the workforce. As part of the research by Fiocruz on working conditions among HCWs, including those considered invisible, we have conducted this study of death among graduated nurses. Although they represent 4 out of 5 members of nursing teams in Brazil, the technicians and assistant nurses remains largely unseen and are covered by the invisible HCW study. We analyzed data from Federal Council of Nurses, publicized at the website Observatorio da Enfermagem. The sociodemographic profile, professional category and timeline of nursing professional deaths were considered. The time period of the study was from March 2020 to March 2021. A total of 670 professionals of the nursing team died, 200 of these were nurses. Among nurses: 59.5% were female and 81.5% were up to 60 years old. Our study registers a concentration of deaths in the North region. Despite having fewer registered professionals, it had the highest number of deaths (29.5%), and the Southeast had the second highest percentage (26.5%). A slow decline was observed until December, when Brazil experienced a second wave of Covid-19. Vaccination of Nurses began in late January 2021; therefore, there was not enough time to assess the impact on morbidity and mortality. The results of a study of almost 50 professional categories are under analysis and will be published shortly. KEY MESSAGES: This study is about death by COVID-19 among nurses in Brazil.

The origin reportedly from Wuhan, China, this pandemic is caused by COVID-19 which belongs to the family of Coronavirus. The increase of infection and mortality has shot up exponentially and has left mankind bewildered amongst the remains of the unseen disaster. During these times of hardship mankind has to face with a series of emotions. Analysis of all these emotions becomes a primary target for the well-being of an individual and mankind as a whole. The main motive of our study is to analyze these emotions correctly. Gathering these big chunks of data about this study from different social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. plays a major role. For this study we will be considering only the corona virus related tweets from Twitter. Analysis of all these tweets will give us a proper insight about the real emotions that the people has to face during these COVID-19 times. The main objective is to work with multinomial attributed to assess the sentiments more precisely. The next step is cleaning the data and labelling them for further processing. Hereafter a model is developed which is used to access the data and then predict the actual sentiment behind the tweet. The data is assessed using the binary-class and multi-class property with the cross-data evaluation of various machine learning algorithms to form the model.

Viral infections are known to trigger asthma exacerbations, but a thorough description of the clinical characteristics of ILI-associated asthma exacerbations and the role of viruses as a risk factor for severe exacerbation (SE) in ILI has not been published yet. Objective To investigate risk factors for SE in patients with ILI and asthma. Methods Patients with ILI symptoms were recruited from 6 hospitals of Mexico (LaRed sites) during 2010 to 2014. Those with a previous asthma diagnosis and ILI symptoms and who were 5 years or older were included. Patients were assigned as cases or controls based on symptoms reported. SE was defined when participants presented with wheezing or dyspnea and required hospitalization. Results A total of 486 patients with ILI and a diagnosis of asthma were included. There were no differences in the proportion, number, or type of viral illness among those with and without SE. Those with SE were less likely to report ILI symptoms. Muscle pain and nasal drip were predictors for patients not progressing to SE. A delay in seeking medical care was associated with SE (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.46-5.88). Conclusion The presence of a particular virus did not predict SE. ILI symptoms in asthma patients are not associated with severe exacerbation. Patients with asthma should be encouraged to seek early medical care when ILI symptoms are first noticed to prevent serious complications.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of Asthmatic Patients With Influenza-Like Illness and Risk for Severe Exacerbations in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence and epidemiological pattern of respiratory viruses in HIV-infected patients and to evaluate their potential clinical impact. DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective population-based cohort study was conducted at three Swiss university hospitals. Study participants were HIV-infected patients who underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage to rule out an opportunistic event. All bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were screened using a set of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 17 different respiratory viruses. RESULTS Between November 2003 and November 2006, 59 bronchoalveolar episodes from 55 HIV-infected patients were analysed. Eleven of 59 episodes (18.6%) were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Coronavirus OC43 was identified in three cases (27.3%) followed by influenza A in two (18.2%). Parainfluenza virus (PIV) 2, PIV 3, PIV 4, bocavirus, human rhinovirus A and human metapneumovirus were each identified in one case (9%). In the majority of these cases (63.6%) no other concomitant microorganism was isolated.

As such, parks may be crucial for how people have handled effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the increasingly limited recreational opportunities, widespread financial uncertainty, and consequent heightened anxiety. Despite the documented benefits of parks, however, many states have instituted park shutdown orders due to fears that public parks could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we use geotagged social media data from state, county, and local parks throughout New Jersey to examine whether park visitation increased when the COVID-19 pandemic began and whether park shutdown orders were effective at deterring park usage. We compare park usage during four discrete stages of spring 2020: (1) before the pandemic began, (2) during the beginning of the pandemic, (3) during the New Jersey governor's state-wide park shutdown order, and (4) following the lifting of the shutdown. We find that park visitation increased by 63.4% with the onset of the pandemic. The subsequent park shutdown order caused visitation in closed parks to decline by 76.1% while parks that remained open continued to experience elevated visitation levels. Visitation then returned to elevated pre-shutdown levels when closed parks were allowed to reopen. Altogether, our results indicate that parks continue to provide crucial services to society, particularly in stressful times when opportunities for recreation are limited. Furthermore, our results suggest that policies targeting human behavior can be effective and are largely reversible. As such, we should continue to invest in public parks and to explore the role of parks in managing public health and psychological well-being.","output":"Public parks and the pandemic: How park usage has been affected by COVID-19 policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Calcium channels play essential roles in sperm motility.

Methamphetamine is known to cause apoptosis in seminiferous tubules and affect sperm quality. This research was conducted to investigate the effects of methamphetamine on expression of the CatSper family and Mvh genes. Thirty-six adult Wistar rats were divided into four groups of nine rats each: the control and experimental groups 1, 2, and 3. The control group received no solvents or drugs, but experimental groups 1, 2, and 3 were daily given 0.2 mL of a solution by gavage that contained 0.5, 1, and 2 mg of methamphetamine, respectively, for 45 days. The rats were then anesthetized, and one testis removed from each rat was used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's posthoc test were used to analyze the data at the P < 0.05 significance level. Treatment with methamphetamine resulted in decreased testis and epididymis weights compared to the control rats. The results showed that the mRNA fold expression level of the CatSper family and Mvh genes decreased significantly in experimental groups compared to that in the control (P < 0.05). Methamphetamine decreased the expression levels of the CatSper and Mvh genes, and thus, it seemed that it can increase the probability of infertility through sperm motility reduction by lowering the expression levels of these genes.","output":"Methamphetamine Downregulates the Sperm-Specific Calcium Channels Involved in Sperm Motility in Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionUnacceptable practices of health care providers during disasters have been observed because they work outside the scope of their daily practices and have inadequate training.

Older adults may be especially susceptible to declines in sleep quality for multiple reasons, including their elevated risk of social isolation and loneliness during the pandemic. Given the adverse health consequences of poor sleep, there is a need to identify resilience factors that help protect older adults against decreased sleep quality. Social integration is a plausible resilience factor because involvement in a broad range of social relationships is thought to promote psychological well-being (e.g., meaning, purpose in life), as well as reduce the intensity and duration of negative psychological states. Social integration may also assume increased importance during the coronavirus pandemic because of normative declines in overall social contact. This prospective study assessed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on older adults sleep quality and tested whether social integration moderated the impact of the pandemic on sleep quality. METHODS: A sample of 115 retired older adults (mean age = 68.6, 58% female, 89% white) completed self-report assessments of their social integration (number of roles on Cohens Social Network Index) and sleep quality (global score on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) before and after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic (mean duration of follow-up = 2.3 years). RESULTS: Multilevel analyses indicated that social integration moderated the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on sleep quality; there was no main effect of time. Older adults with low social integration had reduced sleep quality from Time 1 to Time 2 (b=.94, p=.02), whereas older adults with high social integration showed no changes in sleep quality over time (b=-.38, p=.37). CONCLUSION: Broader social networks confer resilience against pandemic-related declines in sleep quality among older adults. The level of social integration should be addressed when studying or treating sleep complaints during the coronavirus pandemic. Additional research is warranted to determine whether psychosocial interventions targeted towards older adults with low social integration can reduce observed differences in sleep quality.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 510 students who were studying at Kerman University of Medical Sciences in 2019. The students were selected using multi-stage cluster sampling. The instruments used to collect the data were three standard questionnaires and a data collection form. The collected were analyzed statistically with SPSS software (version 22). Results: The mean score of Internet addiction was 36.7318. Overall, 140 students (27.4%) were at the pre-addiction stage and 19 students (3.7%) were severely dependent on the Internet and social media. Internet addiction had a significant correlation with depression and happiness. However, no significant relationship was observed between Internet addiction and academic achievement. The results of multivariate linear regression analysis showed that Internet addiction was significantly correlated with the students age (P = 0.047), marital status (P = 0.001), and academic level (P = 0.002). Conclusion: The results of this study suggested approximately one-third of students were dependent on the Internet and social media or were about to become addicted. The results also confirmed the link between Internet addiction with depression and happiness in the students.

It results in job loss on the one hand and less wages, increased working hours, overqualified employees and part time jobs on the other hand. Low demand of labour and a huge availability of work force will put many in a disadvantageous position, where they will have to compromise with the circumstances by being underemployed. Cabinet decisions, by some Indian states like Uttar Pradesh, to suspend the labour laws related to minimum wage, bonus, working hours and other employee benefits will put workers in a highly disadvantageous position of being underemployed. This may lead to many socio-economic, psychological and health-related implications.

To do this, concepts from the social sciences are used, such as the theory of planned behavior, as well as Bayesian inference to abstract the decision-making processes involved in human behavior. A set of simulation experiments with different populations was developed to demonstrate the role that the cultural orientation of a population plays in the management of an epidemic. The results agree with the revised theory, showing that in populations that have a greater inclination towards collectivism, epidemiological indicators evolve in a better way than in those populations where the culture is individualistic.

We used the Open Dataset of Mexican patients with COVID-19 suspicion who had a definite RT-PCR result to develop a statistical model that evaluated the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population. We included patients of all ages with every risk factor provided by the dataset: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiencies, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and pregnancy. The dataset also included an unspecified category for other risk factors that were not specified as a single variable. To avoid excluding potential patients at risk, that category was included in our analysis. Due to the nature of the dataset, the calculation of a standardized comorbidity index was not possible. Therefore, we treated risk factors as a categorical variable with two categories: absence of risk factors and the presence of at least one risk factor in accordance with previous epidemiological reports. Multiple logistic regressions were carried out to associate sex, risk factors, and age as a continuous variable (and the interaction that accounted for increasing diseases with older ages); and SARS-CoV-2 infection as the dependent zero-one binomial variable. Post estimation predictive marginal analysis was performed to generate probability trends along 95% confidence bands. This analysis was repeated several times through the course of the pandemic since the first record provided in their repository (April 12, 2020) to one month after the end of the state of sanitary emergency (the last date analyzed: June 27, 2020). After processing, the last measurement included 464,389 patients. The baseline analysis on April 12 revealed that people 35 years and older with at least one risk factor had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to patients without risk factors (Figure 1). One month before the end of the nationwide state of emergency this age threshold was found at 50 years (May 2, 2020) and it shifted to 65 years on May 30. Two weeks after the end of the public emergency (June 13, 2020) the trends converged at 80 years and one week later (June 27, 2020) every male and female patient with at least one risk factor had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to people without risk factors. Through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all four probability curves shifted upwards as a result of progressive disease spread. In conclusion, we found our model could monitor accurately the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to age, sex, and the presence of at least one risk factor.

To investigate the impact of the lockdown on aerosol chemistry, the number fraction, size distribution and formation process of oxalic acid (C2) containing particles and its precursors were studied using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) at the urban site of Liaocheng in the North China Plain (NCP). Our results showed that five air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO) decreased by 30.0-59.8% during the lockdown compared to those before the lockdown, while O3 increased by 63.9% during the lockdown mainly due to the inefficient titration effect of O3 via NO reduction. The increased O3 concentration can boost the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and further enhance the formation of secondary organic aerosols, thereby significantly enhancing the C2 particles and its precursors as observed during the lockdown. Before the lockdown, C2 particles was significantly originated from biomass burning emissions and their subsequent aqueous-phase oxidation. The hourly variation patterns and correlation analysis before the lockdown suggested that relative humidity (RH) and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) played a key role in the formation of C2 particles and the increased aerosol acidity can promote the conversion of precursors such as glyoxal (Gly) and methyglyoxal (mGly) into C2 particles in the aqueous phase. RH and ALWC decreased sharply but O3 concentration and solar radiation increased remarkably during the lockdown, the O3-dominated photochemical pathways played an important role in the formation of C2 particles in which aerosol acidity was ineffective. Our study indicated that air pollution treatment sponges on a joint-control and balanced strategy for controlling numerous pollutants.","output":"Enhanced photochemical formation of secondary organic aerosols during the COVID-19 lockdown in Northern China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider a supercritical branching process and define a contact tracing mechanism on its genealogical tree.

The value of sharing anonymised data from clinical trials is well recognised with a moderated access approach recommended. While substantial challenges to data sharing remain, there are additional challenges for qualitative data. Qualitative data including videos, interviews, and observations are often more readily identifiable than quantitative data. Existing guidance from UK Economic and Social Research Council applies to sharing qualitative data but does not address the additional challenges related to sharing qualitative data collected within trials, including the need to incorporate the necessary information and consent into already complex recruitment processes, with the additional sensitive nature of health-related data. Methods: Work package 1 will involve separate focus group interviews with members of each stakeholder group: trial managers, clinical trialists, qualitative researchers, members of research funding bodies and trial participants who have been involved in qualitative research. Data will be analysed using thematic analysis and managed within QSR NVivo to enhance transparency. Work package 2 will involve a documentary analysis of current consent procedures for qualitative data collected as part of the conduct of clinical trials. We will include documents such as participant information leaflets and consent forms for the qualitative components in trials. We will extract data such as whether specific clauses for data sharing are included in the consent form. Content analysis will be used to analyse whether and how consent is being obtained for qualitative data sharing.

Secondary objectives aimed to check the mediating effect of depression in the association between time spent on social media to get the news and the presence of suicidal ideation. This is a cross-sectional study executed between April and May 2021. It involved 402 Lebanese citizens aged 18 years and above, selected randomly from all Lebanese districts. Having cancer (Beta = 0.20) or lung disease (Beta = 0.27), more fear of COVID-19 (Beta = 0.16), a higher time spent on social media for news (Beta = 0.13) and a higher household crowding index (Beta = 0.29) were significantly associated with more depression, whereas having a pet in the house (Beta = -0.13) and working in the medical field (Beta = -0.17) were significantly associated with less depression. Higher depression (aOR = 1.19) was significantly associated with higher odds of having suicidal ideation, whereas more fear of COVID-19 (aOR = 0.84) and older age (aOR = 0.96) were significantly associated with less odds of having suicidal ideation. Depression did not mediate the association between time spent on social media to get the news and suicidal ideation. This study showed that more time spent on social media reading the news is associated with higher depression but not suicidal ideation. Fear of Covid-19 is associated with more depression, but less suicidal ideation. Further studies are needed to identify the causality between social media news consumption, depression and suicidal ideation. Moreover, awareness campaigns should be organized to teach people how to consume social media news in a responsible way, without letting it affect their emotions directly, which may cause psychological disorders.","output":"Association of the time spent on social media news with depression and suicidal ideation among a sample of Lebanese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Lebanese economic crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study quantifies the economic impacts of SARS on the four affected Asian economies and the two most affected Chinese regions using synthetic control methods with macroeconomic and remote-sensing nightlight data.

These economies grew at a very fast pace in the post-SARS period, showing a strong V-shaped recovery. We detect a persistent decrease of 2-4 percent in the affected Chinese regions, Guangdong and Beijing;and this identifiable downturn appears to be robust to placebo analysis with standard synthetic control methods, but not when using the Augmented Synthetic Control method (ASCM). The ASCM analysis suggests that even the decline in the most heavily affected Chinese regions was fairly short lived. Overall, these finding suggests that the benign picture that emerges from the analysis of national-level data might be somewhat misleading;but that SARS did not eventually lead to statistically observable declines in economic activity, given its relatively limited spread to other countries, and the affected countries ability to stop its spread within very quickly.

However, the extent of these benefits also in lower kidney-risk T2D populations needs further investigation. METHODS Members of Maccabi Healthcare Systems listed in their T2D registry who initiated new glucose lowering agents (GLA), were divided into SGLT2i initiators and other GLAs (oGLAs). Groups were propensity score-matched by baseline demographic and medical characteristics. Two composite cardiovascular outcomes were defined: all-cause mortality (ACM) or hospitalization for heart failure (hHF); and ACM, myocardial infraction (MI) or stroke. The cardiorenal outcome was: ACM, new end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or  40% reduction from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Renal-specific outcome was new ESKD or  40% eGFR reduction. Single components of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were also assessed. Three subgroup definitions of low baseline kidney-risk were used: eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2; urinary albumin below detectable levels; and low risk according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Analyses were performed utilizing an unadjusted model, and a model adjusted to baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. RESULTS Between April 1, 2015 and June 30, 2018; 68,187 patients initiated new GLAs - 11,321 SGLT2i initiators and 42,077 oGLAs initiators were eligible. Propensity score-matching yielded two comparable cohorts; each included 9219 participants. Median follow-up was 1.7 years. Compared to oGLAs, SGLT2i initiators had lower incidence of ACM or hHF [HR95%CI = 0.62(0.51-0.75)]; ACM, MI or stroke [0.67(0.57-0.80)]; the cardiorenal outcome [0.65(0.56-0.76)]; and the renal-specific outcome [0.70(0.57-0.85)]. SGLT2i initiators also had lower risk for ACM, hHF and  30%,  40%,  50%,  57% eGFR reduction. No difference between groups was observed for MI or stroke. In the low baseline kidney-risk subgroups, SGLT2i initiation was generally associated with lower risk of the cardiovascular and cardiorenal outcomes, driven mainly by lower ACM incidence. CONCLUSIONS Our findings in the general population of patients with T2D demonstrates lower risk of cardiorenal outcomes associated with initiation of SGLT2i compared with oGLAs, including specifically in patients with low baseline kidney-risk.","output":"Cardiorenal outcomes with sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and low kidney risk: real world evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pneumonia outbreak with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.

METHODS A collection (15) of consultations (in English) between specialists (3) and patients (14) were recorded in a metropolitan gastrointestinal clinic in Australia. These recordings were closely examined using conversation analysis, which focuses on the structural and sequential organisation of interaction. RESULTS Patients used a variety of interactional approaches to contribute to the agenda throughout the consultations. This was achieved in collaboration with the doctors, whose responses generally allowed for these contributions. However, there were few doctor-driven, explicit opportunities provided to patients to contribute to the agenda. CONCLUSION Many patients and doctors are adept at managing the interactional challenges of telehealth consultations but there are clear opportunities to extend this advantage to those patients with less agency.

Italian hospitals modified their usual practice to ensure adequate number of beds for COVID-19 patients. The common management of admitted patients changed to reduce the risk of transmission and parent's visits were strongly limited. Moreover, fear and anxiety caused patients to delay appropriate treatment, resulting in poor outcomes. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the major nosocomial infections. In more than 80% of cases it is related to urological diseases, especially linked to infective stone disease and use of urinary drainages. Pre-operative and post-operative infections are a main challenge in everyday urologic activity. The aim of the present study was to compare the incidence of nosocomial urinary infection during the pandemic period of 2020 with the non-pandemic period of 2019 to investigate the prophylactic role of the strict antiseptic rules adopted during pandemic. Materials and Methods: According with the aims of the study the files of the patients submitted to urological interventions in a 3-month period (March-May) 2019 and (March-May) 2020 were reviewed. A dedicated database was generated. Patients' clinical pre-operative characteristics, including smoking status and BMI were recorded. Charlson comorbidity index and main comorbidities with particular attention to cardiovascular, pulmonary and neurological diseases, diabetes and hypertension were included. Symptoms, fever, laboratory data and urine culture were recorded pre-intra- and postoperatively when available. Urological surgery was classified in five categories: i) major abdominal surgery, (both open and laparoscopic), ii) endoscopic intervention upper urinary tract, iii). endoscopic intervention lower urinary tract, iv) minor open surgery, v) nephrostomy and ureteral stenting. Post-operative complications were classified according to Clavien-Dindo score. The data obtained were submitted to statistical analysis to compare the two different 3-month periods, pre-pandemic in 2019 and pandemic in 2020. The association of the treatment period with categorical variables was assessed using 2 test. All p-values were two-sided and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using R 3.4.2 statistical software. Results: Out of 367 urological interventions, 210 (57.2%) were performed in pre-pandemic March-May 2019 and 157 (42.3%) in the same 3-month pandemic period 2020.

Preoperative and postoperative clinical and laboratory signs of urinary infection showed statistically lower incidence during the pandemic period: pre-operative (p<0.003) and post-operative fever (p<0.02), pre-operative white blood cells count WBC (p<0.03), post-operative urineculture (p<0.03). No difference emerged in surgical wound or pulmonary infections. A mild lower incidence of score 2 Clavien- Dindo complications was evident during the pandemic. Discussion and Conclusion: The present study revealed a statistically significant reduction of the clinical and laboratory signs of urinary infection during the pandemic 3-month period of 2020 when compared with the matching non-pandemic period of 2019. Since the two groups of patients showed similar clinical characteristics and comorbidities, the results obtained by our study can be ascribed to the strong preventive measures adopted during COVID-19 pandemic: frequent hand washing, reduced acce s to hospital wards and distancing between patients in hospital rooms and common spaces. The abovementioned preventive measures can reduce post-operative contamination and urinary infection considering that no difference emerged in intra-operative urine culture.","output":"Urinary infections in urologic surgery and COVID-19 pandemic surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E. coli is associated with high rates of infection and resistance to drugs not only in China but also the rest of the world. In addition, the number of E. coli biofilm infections continue to increase with time. Notably, biofilms are attractive targets for the prevention of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the pgaABCD-encoded Poly--1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) plays an important role in biofilm formation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the specific effect of the (R)-(+)-pulegone (PU) on growth and biofilm formation in multi-drug resistant E. coli. The molecular mechanisms involved were also examined. The results showed that PU had significant antibacterial and antibiofilm formation activity against E. coli K1, with MIC and MBC values of 23.68 and 47.35 mg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, the maximum inhibition rate for biofilm formation in the bacterium was 52.36 % at 94.70 mg/mL of PU. qRT-PCR data showed that PU significantly down-regulated expression of the pgaABCD genes (P < 0.05). PU was also broadly effective against biofilm formation in MG1655 and MG1655/pgaABCD, exhibiting the maximum inhibition rates were 98.23 % and 93.35 %, respectively. In addition, PU destroyed pre-formed mature biofilm in both MG1655 and MG1655/pgaABCD about 95.03 % and 92.4 %, respectively. The study therefore verified that pgaA was a potential and key target for PU in E. coli although it was not the only one. Overall, the findings indicated that PU is a potential and novel inhibitor of drug resistance, This therefore gives insights on new ways of preventing and treating biofilm-associated infections in the food industry as well as in clinical practice.","output":"The specific effect of (R)-(+)-pulegone on growth and biofilm formation in multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli and molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of pgaABCD genes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapyCpain is an evidence-based treatment for chronic pain that can have significant patient burden, including health care cost, travel, multiple sessions, and lack of access in remote areas. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to pilot test the efficacy of a single-session videoconference-delivered empowered relief (ER) intervention compared to waitlist control (WLC) conditions among individuals with chronic pain. We hypothesized that ER would be superior to WLC in reducing pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, and other pain-related outcomes at 1-3 months posttreatment. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving a web-based sample of adults (N=104) aged 18-80 years with self-reported chronic pain. Participants were randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 unblinded study groups: ER (50/104, 48.1%) and WLC (54/104, 51.9%). Participants allocated to ER completed a Zoom-delivered class, and all participants completed follow-up surveys at 2 weeks and 1, 2, and 3 months posttreatment. All the study procedures were performed remotely and electronically. The primary outcome was pain catastrophizing 1-month posttreatment, with pain intensity, pain bothersomeness, and sleep disruption as secondary outcomes. We also report a more rigorous test of the durability of treatment effects at 3 months posttreatment. Data were collected from September 2020 to February 2021 and analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis. The analytic data set included participants (18/101, 17.8% clinic patients; 83/101, 82.1% community) who completed at least one study survey: ER (50/101, 49.5%) and WLC (51/104, 49%). RESULTS: Participants (N=101) were 69.3% (70/101) female, with a mean age of 49.76 years (SD 13.90; range 24-78); 32.7% (33/101) had an undergraduate degree and self-reported chronic pain for 3 months. Participants reported high engagement (47/50, 94%), high satisfaction with ER (mean 8.26, SD 1.57; range 0-10), and high satisfaction with the Zoom platform (46/50, 92%). For the between-groups factor, ER was superior to WLC for all primary and secondary outcomes at 3 months posttreatment (highest P<.001), and between-groups Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.45 to 0.79, indicating that the superiority was of moderate to substantial clinical importance. At 3 months, clinically meaningful pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) reductions were found for ER but not for WLC (ER: PCS ?8.72, 42.25% reduction; WLC: PCS ?2.25, 11.13% reduction). ER resulted in significant improvements in pain intensity, sleep disturbance, and clinical improvements in pain bothersomeness. CONCLUSIONS: Zoom-delivered ER had high participant satisfaction and very high engagement. Among adults with chronic pain, this single-session, Zoom-delivered, skills-based pain class resulted in clinically significant improvement across a range of pain-related outcomes that was sustained at 3 months. Web-based delivery of ER could allow greater accessibility of home-based pain treatment and could address the inconveniences and barriers faced by patients when attempting to receive in-person care.

HYPOTHESIS/GAP STATEMENT: We proposed that R. crenulata might have potential value in the treatment of COVID-19 patients by regulating the immune response and inhibiting cytokine storm. AIM: We aimed to explore the potential molecular mechanism for Rhodiola crenulata (R. crenulata), against the immune regulation of COVID-19, and to provide a referenced candidate Tibetan herb (R. crenulata) to overcome COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Components and targets of R. crenulata were retrieved from the TCMSP database. GO analysis and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were built by R bioconductor package to explore the potential biological effects for targets of R. crenulata. The R. crenulata-compound-target network, target pathway network and proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network were constructed using Cytoscape 3.3.0. Autodock 4.2 and Discovery Studio software were applied for molecular docking. RESULT: Four bioactive components (quercetin, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O--l-rhamnoside and tamarixetin) and 159 potential targets of R. crenulata were identified from the TCMSP database. The result of GO annotation and KEGG-pathway-enrichment analyses showed that target genes of R. crenulata were associated with inflammatory response and immune-related signalling pathways, especially IL-17 signalling pathway, and TNF signalling pathway. Targets-pathway network and PPI network showed that IL-6, IL-1B and TNF- were considered to be hub genes. Molecular docking showed that core compound (quercetin) had a certain affinity with IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-.

This study aimed to determine the level of life satisfaction (LLS) of Polish nurses. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) by Diener, Emmons, Larsen, and Griffin adapted to Polish by Juczynski was used. The opinions of 239 nurses were statistically analyzed. Results. The mean life satisfaction score of the studied nurses was 19.78 +/- 5.47 points. Low LLS was found in 33.05% of the studied nurses, average LLS in 41,00%, and high LLS in 25.94%. Life satisfaction was influenced by a nurse's place of residence and marital status. Survival of a SARS-CoV-2 infection had no significant effect on the nurses' life satisfaction. Conclusions. The majority of nurses reported a low to average LLS and steps should be taken to change this situation.

The member genera include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, Torovirus, and Bafinivirus. The members of the family Coronaviridae are enveloped and positive stranded RNA viruses of three classes of vertebrates, which include corona- and toroviruses for mammals, coronaviruses for birds, and bafiniviruses for fishes. The nucleocapsids are helical and can be released from the virion by treatment with detergents. Where the coronavirus nucleocapsid appears to be loosely wound, those of the Torovirinae are distinctively tubular. The entire replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the production of full-length and subgenome-sized (sg) minus-strand RNA intermediates with the viral genome serving both as mRNA for the replicase polyproteins and as a template for minus-strand synthesis. Members of the family Coronaviridae all seem to share two envelope protein species, the membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins. Similarities in size, predicted structures and presumed function(s) suggest a common ancestry, and the remote, but significant sequence similarities observed for toro-, bafini-, and (to lesser extent) coronavirus S proteins lend further support to this view.

METHODS: We created a score-based algorithm by combining laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic data to evaluate 69 cases with inconclusive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay (18 cases) and the TaqPath assay (51 cases). RESULTS: We determined 5 (28%) of 18 (CDC assay) and 20 (39%) of 51 (TaqPath assay) cases to be false positive. Lowering the cycle threshold cutoff from 40 to 37 in the TaqPath assay resulted in a dramatic reduction of the false-positive rate to 14%. We also showed testing of asymptomatic individuals is associated with a significantly higher probability of having a false-positive result. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results can be false positive, especially among asymptomatic patients.

Recombination serves as a repair system as well as a means of changing the genetic structure of the virus. The reaction can be studied in an in-vitro packaging and replication system involving purified procapsids and ssRNA.

We found a strong correlation between a higher case fatality rate and poorer access to safe drinking water as well as safe sanitation. The Pearson correlation is stronger for access to safe sanitation ( -0.30) compared to access to safe drinking water (-0.20). The Chad, Niger and Sierra Leone were amongst the countries with the highest fatality rates (>6.0) and also had particularly poor access to safe drinking water (<34%) and safe sanitation (<22%). The hypothesis of an association between COVID-19 fatalities and poor access to water and sanitation was confirmed by this study. However, our analysis does not establish causality.

We aimed to evaluate coagulation features in hospitalized patients under warfarin treatment for prosthetic heart valves during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic. METHODS: Between 20 February and 28 March 2020, 10 patients (7 males) who were under warfarin therapy for prosthetic heart valves were hospitalized after a diagnosis of COVID-19 in Tehran Heart Center, Tehran, Iran. The clinical, paraclinical, and in-hospital outcomes were described. The patients were followed for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The median age was 62 years. All the patients received antiviral treatment, either lopinavir/ritonavir or oseltamivir. The serum level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ranged between 0.24 and 15.24 mg/dL. Alanine aminotransaminase was normal in all the patients except for two, with levels 1.6 and 4.2 times above normal values. The INR increased in all the patients. One (10%) patient died in the hospital. No bleeding, ischemic, or thrombotic events occurred during the hospital stay and within the 4-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy in patients with COVID-19 with prosthetic heart valves might be an issue responsible for an uncontrolled INR. Liver injury may happen in a minority of patients.

SGM individuals report elevated rates of emotional distress, symptoms related to mood and anxiety disorders, self-harm, and suicidal ideation and behavior. Social support is inversely related to psychiatric symptoms, regardless of SGM status. The COVID-19 pandemicwith its associated limited social interactionsrepresents an unprecedented period of acute distress with potential reductions in accessibility of social support, which might be of particular concern for SGM individuals' mental well-being. In the present study, we explored the extent to which potential changes in mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, worry, perceived stress, positive and negative affect) throughout the duration of the pandemic were related to differences in perceptions of social support and engagement in virtual social activity, as a function of SGM status. Utilizing a large sample of US adults (N = 1,014; 18% reported SGM status), we assessed psychiatric symptoms, perceptions of social isolation, and amount of time spent socializing virtually at 3 time windows during the pandemic (between March 21 and May 21). Although SGM individuals reported greater levels of depression compared with non-SGM individuals at all 3 time points, there was no interaction between time and SGM status. Across all participants, mental health outcomes improved across time. Perceived social isolation was associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Further, time spent engaging in virtual socialization was associated with reduced depression, but only for those in self-reported quarantine. We discuss these results in terms of the nature of our sample and its impact on the generalizability of these findings to other SGM samples as well as directions for future research aimed at understanding potential health disparities in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Comparing the Impact of COVID-19-Related Social Distancing on Mood and Psychiatric Indicators in Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) and Non-SGM Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multicenter clinical and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) studies require a high degree of reproducibility across different sites and scanner manufacturers, as well as time points. We therefore implemented a multiparameter mapping (MPM) protocol based on vendor's product sequences and demonstrate its repeatability and reproducibility for whole-brain coverage. Within ~20 min, four MPM metrics (magnetization transfer saturation [MT], proton density [PD], longitudinal [R1], and effective transverse [R2*] relaxation rates) were measured using an optimized 1 mm isotropic resolution protocol on six 3 T MRI scanners from two different vendors. The same five healthy participants underwent two scanning sessions, on the same scanner, at each site. MPM metrics were calculated using the hMRI-toolbox. To account for different MT pulses used by each vendor, we linearly scaled the MT values to harmonize them across vendors. To determine longitudinal repeatability and inter-site comparability, the intra-site (i.e., scan-rescan experiment) coefficient of variation (CoV), inter-site CoV, and bias across sites were estimated. For MT, R1, and PD, the intra- and inter-site CoV was between 4 and 10% across sites and scan time points for intracranial gray and white matter. A higher intra-site CoV (16%) was observed in R2* maps. The inter-site bias was below 5% for all parameters. In conclusion, the MPM protocol yielded reliable quantitative maps at high resolution with a short acquisition time. The high reproducibility of MPM metrics across sites and scan time points combined with its tissue microstructure sensitivity facilitates longitudinal multicenter imaging studies targeting microstructural changes, for example, as a quantitative MRI biomarker for interventional clinical trials.","output":"Multiparameter mapping of relaxation (R1, R2*), proton density and magnetization transfer saturation at 3 T: A multicenter dual-vendor reproducibility and repeatability study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Affective polarization and stigma toward individuals with schizophrenia and toward immigrants in Argentina are not new despite its importance and dissemination.

METHOD Individuals from Buenos Aires (n = 712) were surveyed for their political partisanship and their attitudes toward Peruvian and Bolivian immigrants, people with schizophrenia and partisans from the opposing political party. A modified version of the Bogardus scale was used. RESULTS Social distance was from highest to lowest toward people with schizophrenia, political opponents, and immigrants. Individuals with schizophrenia were strongly discriminated against by most participants: 86% would definitely or probably not want them to take care of their children, 83% would not want them to be their healthcare provider, and 81% would not want to marry them. Immigrants were comparatively not discriminated against: 10% would not want them to take care of their children, 8% would not want to receive health care from them, and 28% would not want to marry them. Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner partisans showed the lowest level of discrimination toward these two groups, compared to Mauricio Macri partisans and to independent voters. However, the former group had greater discriminatory attitudes toward Mauricio Macri partisans than the latter.

The more traditional ways of teaching and learning this skill require practice and are often limited by time constraints. With the rise of technology-based platforms, students can supplement their learning health assessment skills through other means, such as videos, that not only teach the steps but also allow them to learn in context. OBJECTIVES This study describes how a symptom-focused health assessment and empathy (SHAE) program, which primarily involves the use of a case-based health assessment video, was implemented and evaluated. DESIGN The study involved a single-centre, single-blind, parallel randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS The study was conducted at a university in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS Year one undergraduate nursing students enrolled in the Comprehensive Health Assessment (CHA) module during semester two of the academic year 2018/2019 participated in the study. METHODS Participants were randomized into one of the two parallel groups: the experimental group or the waitlisted control (WL) group. The experimental group received the SHAE program in addition to conventional learning methods (e-lectures, lab demonstration, and pair practice). The WL group received only the conventional learning methods. Pre- and post-test measures of the study variables such as knowledge, health assessment skills, confidence, empathy, and intention to learn were conducted. The WL group was given access to the SHAE program after the post-test. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to compare the means of the study variables between the intervention and WL groups. RESULTS Participants in the intervention group had significantly higher scores on knowledge (p = 0.016), confidence (p = 0.03), and health assessment skills (p = 0.004). No significant differences in intention to learn and empathy between the two groups were found. CONCLUSION The use of a case-based video has the potential to be a valuable method of teaching health assessments in context to nursing students. The SHAE program has shown beneficial effects on students' knowledge, health assessment skills, and confidence. However, there was no effect on students' intentions to learn and their empathy. Further refinements of the program will need to focus on improving these domains.","output":"Evaluation of the symptom-focused health assessment and empathy program for undergraduate nursing students: A randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been dramatically improved with the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies to chemotherapy, defining a new standard of care for many years.

Measures have been taken by dermatologists to control the transmission of the virus, whereas providing health care to patients in the constrained environment. Preventive measures such as social distancing and hand hygienic practices along with patient education is being prioritized. Dermatological conferences and events scheduled across the globe in the first half of year 2020 have been either cancelled or postponed to discourage gatherings. Rationalization of resources and practice of teledermatology are being encouraged in current scenario. Non-urgent visits of the patients are being discouraged and elective dermatology procedures are being postponed.

We hypothesized that high-dose preoperative methylprednisolone (MP) would improve analgesia compared to placebo. METHODS A total of 120 adult patients were randomized equally to 125 mg MP or placebo before the start of their elective video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy. Group allocation was blinded to patients, investigators and caregivers, and all patients received standardized multimodal, opioid-sparing analgesia. Our primary outcome was area under the curve on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, for pain scores on the day of surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 2. Clinical follow-up was 2-3 weeks, and telephone follow-up was 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS Ninety-six patients were included in the primary analysis. Methylprednisolone significantly decreased median pain scores on the day of surgery: at rest (numeric rating scale 1.6 vs 2.0, P = 0.019) and after mobilization to a sitting position (numeric rating scale 1.7 vs 2.5, P = 0.004) but not during arm abduction and coughing (P = 0.052 and P = 0.083, respectively). Nausea and fatigue were reduced on the day of surgery (P = 0.04 and 0.03), whereas no outcome was improved on postoperative Days 1 and 2. Methylprednisolone did not increase the risk of complications but increased blood glucose levels on the day of surgery (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS High-dose preoperative MP significantly reduced pain at rest and after mobilization to a sitting position on the day of surgery, without later analgesic effects. Nausea and fatigue were improved without side effects, except transient higher postoperative blood glucose levels.

It becomes more relevant as the cost of discovering new drugs steadily increases. To find new potential targets for a drug, an abundance of methods and existing biomedical knowledge from different domains can be leveraged. Recently, knowledge graphs have emerged in the biomedical domain that integrate information about genes, drugs, diseases and other biological domains. Knowledge graphs can be used to predict new connections between compounds and diseases, leveraging the interconnected biomedical data around them. While real world use cases such as drug repurposing are only interested in one specific relation type, widely used knowledge graph embedding models simultaneously optimize over all relation types in the graph. This can lead the models to underfit the data that is most relevant for the desired relation type. We propose a method that leverages domain knowledge in the form of metapaths and use them to filter two biomedical knowledge graphs (Hetionet and DRKG) for the purpose of improving performance on the prediction task of drug repurposing while simultaneously increasing computational efficiency. Results: We find that our method reduces the number of entities by 60% on Hetionet and 26% on DRKG, while leading to an improvement in prediction performance of up to 40.8% on Hetionet and 12.4% on DRKG, with an average improvement of 17.5% on Hetionet and 5.1% on DRKG. Additionally, prioritization of antiviral compounds for SARS CoV-2 improves after task-driven filtering is applied. Conclusion: Knowledge graphs contain facts that are counter productive for specific tasks, in our case drug repurposing.

Patients frequently choose the ED for non-emergent medical issues or injuries that could readily be handled in a primary care setting. We analyzed encounters in the ED at the Brooke Army Medical Center-the largest hospital in the Department of Defense-to determine the percentage of visits that could potentially be managed in a lower cost, appointment-based setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients within our electronic medical record system from September 2019 to August 2020, which represented equidistance from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a shift in ED used based on previously published data. Our study also compared the number of ED visits pre-covid vs. post-covid. We defined visits to be primary care eligible if they were discharged home and received no computed tomography imaging, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, intravenous medications, or intramuscular-controlled substances. RESULTS During the 12 month period, we queried data on 75,205 patient charts. We categorized 56.7% (n = 42,647) of visits as primary care eligible within our chart review. Most primary-care-eligible visits were ESI level 4 (59.2%). The largest proportion of primary-care-eligible patients (28.3%) was seen in our fast-track area followed by our pediatric pod (21.9%). The total number of ED visits decreased from 7,477 pre-covid to 5,057 post-covid visits. However, the proportion of patient visits that qualified as primary care eligible was generally consistent.

The reaction scheme used to describe this mechanism is an extension of the well-known Michaelis-Menten model proposed in 1913 by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten [1]. The model I present here takes into account that one Mpro enzyme monomer interacts with another Mpro monomer in the presence of the substrate, leading to the formation of an enzyme dimer bound to one substrate molecule. Indeed, this dimer is formed by the sequentially binding of one Mpro enzyme monomer to one molecule of substrate, followed by another Mpro enzyme monomer binding to this Mpro-substrate complex. This reaction mechanism is also known in the literature as substrate-induced dimerization [3]. Starting from this new reaction scheme established for this catalytic mechanism, I derived a mathematical expression describing the catalytic rate of the active Mpro enzyme dimer as a function of the substrate concentration [S]. The plot corresponding to this substrate-induced dimerization reaction shows a function f ([S]) that is not monotonic, i.e. not strictly increasing or decreasing, but with a second derivative initially negative and then becoming positive after having passed the Vmax point. This is typically a type of curve showing a phenomenon like the one of substrate inhibition (for instance, inhibition by excess-substrate [7]). The graphical representation of this process shows an interesting behaviour: from zero M/s, the reaction rate increases progressively, similar to the kind of curve described by the Michaelis-Menten model. However, after having reached its maximum catalytic rate, Vmax, the reaction rate decreases progressively as we continue to increase the substrate concentration. I propose an explanation to this interesting behavior. At the moment where Vcat is maximum, we can assume that, in theory, every single substrate molecule in solution is bound to two enzyme monomers (i.e. to one active dimer). The catalytic rate is thus theoretically maximized. At the time where the reaction rate begins to decrease, we observe a new phenomenon that appears: the enzyme monomers begin to be diluted in the solution containing the excess substrate. The dimers begin to dissociate and to bind increasingly to the substrate as inactive monomers instead of active dimers. Hence, it is more and more unlikely for the enzyme monomers to sequentially bind twice to the same substrate molecule (here, [E] ? [S]). Thus, at this stage, the substrate-induced dimerization occurs less often. At the limit, when the substrate is in high excess, there is virtually no more dimerization which occurs. This is one example of excess-substrate inhibition. Furthermore, after having established this fact, I wanted to see if this catalytic behavior was also observed in vitro. Therefore, I conducted an experiment where I measured the catalytic rate of the Mpro dimer for different substrate concentrations. The properties of my substrate construct were such, that I could determine the catalytic rate of the enzyme dimer by directly measuring the spectrophotometric absorbance of the cleaved substrate at  = 405 nm. The results show explicitly  within a margin of error  that the overall shape of the experimental curve looks like the one of the theoretical curve. I thus conclude that the biochemical behavior of the Mpro in vitro follows a new path when it is in contact with its substrate: an excess substrate concentration decreases the activity of the enzyme by the phenomenon of a type of excess-substrate inhibition. This finding could open a new door in the discovery of drugs directed against the Mpro enzyme of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, acting on the inhibition by excess-substrate of the Mpro enzyme, this protein being a key component in the metabolism of the virus. Furthermore, I have established that the maximum of the fitted curve, Vmax, depends only on [E]T and not on [S]. exhibits the same dependence pattern. Therefore, if I keep [E]T close to zero, the catalytic rate of the enzyme will also be greatly reduced, which can be understood intuitively. Finally, if we dilute the enzyme sufficiently in the host cell by injecting a suitably high concentration of the octapeptide substrate AVLQSGFR (an inhibitor of the original substrate), this artificial substrate will bind to the intermediate dimer from the polypeptide and prevent the precursor Mpro from auto-cleaving and dimerizing due to the distorted key effect of the octapeptide on the intermediate dimer. The precursor peptide Mpro will auto-cleave to a lesser extent than in the absence of the artificial octapeptide and thus the concentration of the total enzyme [E]T will be lowered in the cell. It would therefore be possible to control the virulence of the virus by adjusting the concentration of the artificial inhibitory octapeptide. However, this is only speculation and has yet to be verified in practice.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease: a Kinetic Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Owing to an increase in digital technologies in health care, recently leveraged by the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians are required to use these technologies appropriately and to be familiar with their implications on patient care, the health system, and society. Therefore, medical students should be confronted with digital health during their medical education. However, corresponding teaching formats and concepts are still largely lacking in the medical curricula. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to introduce digital health as a curricular module at a German medical school and to identify undergraduate medical competencies in digital health and their suitable teaching methods. METHODS: We developed a 3-week curricular module on digital health for third-year medical students at a large German medical school, taking place for the first time in January 2020. Semistructured interviews with 5 digital health experts were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an abductive approach. We obtained feedback from the participating students and lecturers of the module through a 17-item survey questionnaire. RESULTS: The module received overall positive feedback from both students and lecturers who expressed the need for further digital health education and stated that the field is very important for clinical care and is underrepresented in the current medical curriculum. We extracted a detailed overview of digital health competencies, skills, and knowledge to teach the students from the expert interviews. They also contained suggestions for teaching methods and statements supporting the urgency of the implementation of digital health education in the mandatory curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: An elective class seems to be a suitable format for the timely introduction of digital health education. However, a longitudinal implementation in the mandatory curriculum should be the goal. Beyond training future physicians in digital skills and teaching them digital healths ethical, legal, and social implications, the experience-based development of a critical digital health mindset with openness to innovation and the ability to assess ever-changing health technologies through a broad transdisciplinary approach to translate research into clinical routine seem more important. Therefore, the teaching of digital health should be as practice-based as possible and involve the educational cooperation of different institutions and academic disciplines.","output":"Undergraduate Medical Competencies in Digital Health and Curricular Module Development: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Higher education is responsible for providing education that meets international benchmarks relevant to the needs of the international community. Due to the increase of digital tools in higher education, the possibility of sharing learning resources across nations has expanded. In the current project, a Norwegian university invited universities in Spain and the United Kingdom to adapt and translate e-learning resources originally developed for Norwegian nursing students for use within their respective Bachelor in Nursing programmes. AIM: The aim of the current study was to gain insights into the usability and value for learning of e-compendiums shared and implemented across three European universities. METHODS: The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional design and included nursing students from the University of Nottingham, Valencia Catholic University, and the University of Stavanger. Data were collected in Autumn 2017 through a questionnaire adapted from the validated Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning Reusable Learning Object evaluation questionnaire The questionnaire consisted of 19 items that included two aspects: e-compendiums value for learning and e-compendiums usability. The different study sites were compared using a binary logistic regression analysis. Subgroups of students were compared based on their gender and age. RESULTS: A total of 480 nursing students participated in the study. The e -compendiums were overall positively rated, especially for reinforcing and retaining knowledge. Compared to the students from the University of Stavanger, students from Valencia Catholic University rated the e-compendiums more positively in most aspects of learning. Students from University of Nottingham found the e-compendiums to be more important for learning engagement compared to students at the Norwegian study site, and no differences were found in any other aspects of learning. Younger students rated the interactivity and visual components as more important compared to older students. CONCLUSIONS: Students from the University of Nottingham and Valencia Catholic University seem to accept the e-compendiums despite the fact that they were originally developed for use in another country. We argue that, when sharing e-learning resources across countries, an adaptation and translation process that includes a multicultural and multidisciplinary perspective should be carried out.

The current database archives 11 827 unique proteins reported by 164 scientific publications, with a maximal false discovery rate of 0.01 on both the peptide and protein levels since 2001, and enables users to query, analyze and download protein entries with respect to each body fluid. Three unique features of this new system include the following: (i) the protein annotation page includes detailed abundance information based on relative qualitative measures of peptides reported in the original references, (ii) a new score is calculated on each reported protein to indicate the discovery confidence and (iii) HBFP catalogs 7354 proteins with at least two non-nested uniquely mapping peptides of nine amino acids according to the Human Proteome Project Data Interpretation Guidelines, while the remaining 4473 proteins have more than two unique peptides without given sequence information. As an important resource for human protein secretome, we anticipate that this new HBFP database can be a powerful tool that facilitates research in clinical proteomics and biomarker discovery.

DATA SOURCES We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using electronic database search (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Google scholar, and Web of Science), Cochrane, and trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION We conducted an electronic search of research articles from 1966 to January 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard dressing after cesarean delivery among obese women. Our primary outcome was defined as a composite of wound complication, including wound or surgical site infection, cellulitis, seroma, hematoma, wound disruption, or dehiscence. For cohort studies and RCTs, we performed a descriptive systematic review. For available RCTs, we performed a meta-analysis and pooled risk ratios using a random-effects model. We assessed for heterogeneity using  test for heterogeneity and I test. We assessed for publication bias using a funnel plot. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Of 10 studies meeting eligibility criteria, five were RCTs and five were cohort studies. Results of cohort studies were varied; however, all had a high potential for selection bias. In the meta-analysis, there was no difference in primary composite outcome among those women with negative pressure wound therapy (16.8%) compared with those who had standard dressing (17.8%) (risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.63-1.49). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity ( test 4.80, P=.31, I=17%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 66 patients with 264 central incisors in good periodontal health were included in this cross-sectional study. CBCT images were used to assess gingiva and alveolar bone thickness of the maxillary and mandibular incisors at four vertical levels. Cephalometric analysis was used to assess the sagittal profile of the craniofacial structures. Gingival thickness was compared in patients with different craniofacial profiles based on ANB value. Linear regression coefficients adjusted by age and gender were used to evaluate the correlation between gingival thickness and the cephalometric parameters. RESULTS: Individuals with a smaller ANB value (ANB< 2) presented with thinner supporting tissue and a keratinized gingiva width in the anterior zone. Labial gingival thickness on the mandibular incisors at the cementoenamel junction (G1) and at the alveolar bone crest (G2) was positively related to cephalometric measures, indicating a maxillae-mandibular sagittal relationship (ANB value, Wits appraisal, A-NPog value). CONCLUSIONS: A moderate correlation was found between mandibular gingival thickness and the sagittal craniofacial profile. Patients with a concave craniofacial profile had a smaller keratinized gingiva width and gingival thickness in the aesthetic zone.

Hypersensitivity to mRNA vaccines directed against SARS-CoV-2 are rare. They may be related to an IgE-dependent mechanism involving PEG contained in vaccines in the form of liposomes. Direct activation of the classical complement pathway (CARPA) has also been strongly suspected. In addition to skin tests, biomarkers have been proposed: anti-PEG antibodies, determination of anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a, or soluble complex C5b-9. Anti-PEG antibodies can be measured by non-standardized in house methods; their presence in post-vaccination reactions against SARS-CoV2 has not been confirmed by all the studies as well as for complement proteins. Mast cell mediators (histamine and tryptase) could rarely be assayed at the time of reaction and their increase is inconstant depending on studies. A slightly elevated baseline tryptase level in some patients suggests that hyper-alphatryptasemia might be involved. A basophil activation test (BAT) can be performed but the results are still preliminary depending on the allergens used: PEG, PEG in the form of liposomes or vaccine itself. The lack of positivity of skin tests in some patients even though basophils are able to be activated in the presence of the same allergen confirms the hypothesis in this case of a possible non-IgE-dependent phenomenon.

Herein, we report the epidemiological and clinical features of 478 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from a multicenter study conducted in four cities in China excluding Wuhan. METHODS: A total of 478 patients transferred by emergency medical services to designated hospitals in four major cities in China (Beijing, Chongqing, Jinan, and Nanning) were enrolled. We compared the characteristics of imported and indigenous cases and calculated the frequencies of fatal, severe, mild, and asymptomatic disease. The results were used to generate a pyramid of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 46.9 years and 49.8% were male. The most common symptoms at onset were fever (69.7%), cough (47.5%), fatigue (24.5%), dyspnea (8.4%), and headache (7.9%). Most cases (313, 65.5%) were indigenous, while 165 (34.5%) were imported. Imported cases dominated during the early stages of the pandemic, but decreased from 1 February 2020 as indigenous cases rose sharply. Compared with indigenous cases, imported cases differed significantly in terms of sex (P = 0.002), severity of disease (P = 0.006), occurrence of fever (P < 0.001), family clustering (P < 0.001), history of contact (P < 0.001), and primary outcome (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Within the population studied, imported cases had distinct characteristics from those of indigenous cases, with lower fatality rates and higher discharge rates. New infections shifted from imported cases to local infection gradually, and overall infections have declined to a low level.

The consumption of 77 antibiotics for systemic use in 2020 was calculated, and compared against the same period in 2019 to track changes in total consumption and consumption pattern by six assigned therapeutic groups: tetracyclines, quinolones, beta-lactam penicillins, other-beta-lactams, macrolides and others (comprising the remaining groups). Results: The total consumption for January-April 2020 was 17.76 Defined Daily Doses per 1000 population per day (a 18.8% decrease from 2019). Quinolones, beta-lactam penicillins, other-beta-lactams, and macrolides constituted 80% of total consumption. There were increases between February-April 2020 of macrolides and others. In March 2020, 112768 more people consumed a macrolide per day compared to March 2019; mostly azithromycin.

The antibiotics used in the study included tigecycline (TGC), cefoperazone-sulbactam (CPS), ceftazidime (TZ), levofloxacin (LEV), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) (TS). Four different combinations (TGCCPS, TGC-TZ, TGC-LEV, TGC-TS) were studied with the E-test synergy method. Results S. maltophilia isolates were found to have the highest level of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tigecycline, and levofloxacin.

In particular, generative deep learning not only provides competitive prediction performance, but also allows for uncovering structure by generating synthetic samples. However, exploration and visualization is not as straightforward as with image applications. RESULTS We demonstrate how log-linear models, fitted to the generated, synthetic data can be employed to extract patterns from omics data, learned by deep generative techniques. Specifically, interactions between latent representations learned by the approaches and generated synthetic data are used to determine sets of joint patterns. Distances of patterns with respect to the distribution of latent representations are then visualized in low-dimensional coordinate systems, e.g., for monitoring training progress. This is illustrated with simulated data and subsequently with cortical single cell gene expression data. Using different kinds of deep generative techniques, specifically variational autoencoders and deep Boltzmann machines, the proposed approach highlights how the techniques uncover underlying structure. It facilitates the real world use of such generative deep learning techniques in order to gain biological insights from omics data.

Experiential educational strategies, in addition to knowledge-centered learning, are critically important for students to develop their professional identity as system citizens working alongside interprofessional colleagues. Challenges to HSS adoption range from competing priorities for learners, to the need for faculty development, to the necessity for buy-in by medical schools and their associated health care systems.

Since diabetes is a significant risk factor associated with poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients, this article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. AREAS COVERED This paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of existing literature to present various aspects of diabetes management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and is divided into three sections (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycaemic goals for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for diabetes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. EXPERT OPINION The inpatient goal of therapy in both COVID-19 patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, tight glycaemic control, and prevent adverse glycaemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategy for T2DM includes temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy, at least during hospitalization. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral hypoglycaemic agents if glycaemic control is satisfactory. Hyperglycaemia should be anticipated in patients with systemic corticosteroid treatment and managed upon accordingly.","output":"Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes mellitus among hospitalized COVID-19 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 global dynamics is modeled by an adaptation of the deterministic SEIR Model, which takes into account two dominant lineages of the SARS-CoV-2, and a time-varying reproduction number to estimate the disease transmission behavior.

Brazilian official published data from February 25th to August 30th, 2020 was used to adjust a few epidemiologic parameters. The estimated time-dependence mean value to the infected individuals (confirmed cases) presents - in logarithmic scale - standard deviation SD = 0.08 for over six orders of magnitude. Data points for additional three weeks were added after the model was complete, granting confidence on the outcomes. By the end of 2020, the predicted numbers of confirmed cases in Brazil, within 95% credible intervals, may reach 6 Million (5 to 7), and fatalities would accounts for 180 (130 to 220) thousands. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to reach (13 +/- 1) Million, 6.2% of the Brazilian population.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate which sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines are trusted by health care providers and how they communicate this information to patients. METHODS: This mixed methods study involved a one-time, web-based survey of health care providers and qualitative interviews with a subset of survey respondents. Health care providers (physicians, advanced practice providers, pharmacists, nurses) were recruited from an integrated health system in Southern California using voluntary response sampling, with follow-up interviews with providers who either accepted or declined a COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome was the type of information sources that respondents reported trusting for information about COVID-19 vaccines. Bivariate tests were used to compare trusted information sources by provider type; thematic analysis was used to explore perspectives about vaccine information and communicating with patients about vaccines. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 2948 providers, of whom 91% (n=2683) responded that they had received 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The most frequently trusted source of COVID-19 vaccine information was government agencies (n=2513, 84.2%); the least frequently trusted source was social media (n=691, 9.5%). More physicians trusted government agencies (n=1226, 93%) than nurses (n=927, 78%) or pharmacists (n=203, 78%; P<.001), and more physicians trusted their employer (n=1115, 84%) than advanced practice providers (n=95, 67%) and nurses (n=759, 64%; P=.002). Qualitative themes (n=32 participants) about trusted sources of COVID-19 vaccine information were identified: processing new COVID-19 information in a health care work context likened to a war zone during the pandemic and communicating information to patients. Some providers were hesitant to recommend vaccines to pregnant people and groups they perceived to be at low risk for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians have stronger trust in government sources and their employers for information about COVID-19 vaccines compared with nurses, pharmacists, and advanced practice providers. Strategies such as role modeling, tailored messaging, or talking points with standard language may help providers to communicate accurate COVID-19 vaccine information to patients, and these strategies may also be used with providers with lower levels of trust in reputable information sources.","output":"Health Care Providers Trusted Sources for Information About COVID-19 Vaccines: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The S protein subunit 1 (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 is known to be responsible for the binding of the virus to host cell receptors, but the initial intracellular signalling steps following receptor activation of cells in the exocrine pancreas are unknown.

The Ca2+ signals occurred mostly in the form of repetitive Ca2+ spikes. The probability of observing Ca2+ signals depended on the S1 concentration. The threshold was close to 70 nM, whereas at 600 nM, all cells responded. The SARS-Cov-2 nucleocapsid protein did not elicit any Ca2+ signals in any of the three cell types tested. The S1-induced Ca2+ signals in stellate cells started much faster (122  37s) than those in macrophages (468  68s). Furthermore, the interleukin-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) abolished the responses in macrophages without affecting the Ca2+ signals in stellate cells. The S1-elicited Ca2+ signals were completely dependent on the presence of external Ca2+ and were abolished by a selective inhibitor (CM4620) of Orai1 Ca2+ Release Activated Ca2+ channels.

We conducted a randomized trial with an online sample to examine the impact of: (1) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the risk of disease transmission from factory farms, and (2) a message that uses the saliency of the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the threat to worker's health created by factory farms. We examine whether these messages are more effective at changing beliefs about and behavioral intentions towards plant-based eating, as compared to more traditional messages that highlight the environmental, personal health, or animal welfare implications of factory farmed meat consumption. We find that all messages differentially influenced beliefs about the various negative consequences of meat consumption. However, these altered beliefs did not differentially motivate changes in respondents' intentions to reduce meat consumption and choose plant-based alternatives. This was possibly due to the numerous other barriers to behavior change identified in qualitative survey responses, such as cost, taste, and social factors. We did find that messages that highlight the personal health benefits of reduced meat consumption were more effective at increasing public trust in the message deliverer.

Compared to White ethnicity, unadjusted all-cause mortality was similar in Black (RR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.83C1.08]) and Asian (RR: 0.99 [0.85C1.16]) but reduced in Hispanic ethnicity (RR: 0.69 [0.57C0.84]). Age- and sex-adjusted risks were significantly elevated for Black (HR: 1.38 [1.09C1.75]) and Asian (HR: 1.42 [1.15C1.75]), but not for Hispanic (RR: 1.14 [0.93C1.40]). Further adjusting for comorbidities attenuated these associations to non-significance: Black (HR: 0.95 [0.72C1.25]); Asian (HR: 1.17 [0.84C1.63]); Hispanic (HR: 0.94 [0.63C1.44]). Subgroup analyses showed a trend towards greater disparity in outcomes for UK ethnic minorities, especially hospitalisation risk. CONCLUSIONS: This review could not confirm a certain ethnicity as an independent poor prognostic factor for COVID-19. Racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes may be partially attributed to higher comorbidity rates in certain ethnicity.

Nearly ten percent of reported coronavirus infections in Italy occurred in healthcare workers. This study aimed to understand physicians access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and to information about their use, risk perception and strategies adopted to prevent contracting the infection. Methods We undertook a cross-sectional, online self-reported survey implemented between March 31 and April 5 2020 of Italian physicians. Results Responses were received from 529 physicians, only 13% of which reported to have access to PPE every time they need them. Approximately half of the physicians reported that the information received about the use of PPE was either clear (47%) or complete (54%). Risk perception about contracting the infection was influenced by receiving adequate information on the use of PPE. Access to adequate information on the use of PPE was associated with better ability to perform donning and doffing procedures [OR=2.2 95% C.I. 1.7-2.8] and reduced perception of risk [OR=0.5, 95% C.I. 0.4-0.6].

Both viruses are endemic to China where millions of kilograms of feed ingredients are manufactured and subsequently imported into the United States. Although stability and oral transmission of both viruses through contaminated pork products has been demonstrated as a risk factor for transboundary spread, stability in animal feed ingredients had yet to be investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the survival of CSFV and variant PRV in 12 animal feeds and ingredients exposed to environmental conditions simulating a 37-day transpacific shipment. Virus was detected by PCR, virus isolation, and nursery pig bioassay. CSFV and PRV nucleic acids were stable throughout the 37-day period in all feed matrices. Infectious CSFV was detected in 2 ingredients (conventional soybean meal and pork sausage casings) at 37 days post-contamination, whereas infectious PRV was detected in 9 ingredients (conventional and organic soybean meal, lysine, choline, vitamin D, moist cat and dog food, dry dog food and pork sausage casings). This study demonstrates the relative stability of CSFV and PRV in different feed ingredients under shipment conditions and provides evidence that feed ingredients may represent important risk factors for the transboundary spread of these viruses.","output":"Stability of classical swine fever virus and pseudorabies virus in animal feed ingredients exposed to transpacific shipping conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report a case of multiple superior quadrant intraretinal haemorrhages in post-COVID-19 patient.

The right eye was normal. During his 10-day stay, he was treated with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir + ritonavir, ceftriaxone, and his pre-existing antiplatelet therapy. During hospitalization, a complete medical work up showed an anomalous increase in D-dimer. He did not require intensive care support. CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we focused on the origin of retinal bleeding in a post COVID-19 patient, likely due to a focal occlusion of a vessel.

METHOD: This study applied transfer learning method to develop deep learning models for detecting COVID-19 disease. Three existing state-of-the-art deep learning models namely, Inception ResNetV2, InceptionNetV3 and NASNetLarge, were selected and fine-tuned to automatically detect and diagnose COVID-19 disease using chest X-ray images. A dataset involving 850 images with the confirmed COVID-19 disease, 500 images of community-acquired (non-COVID-19) pneumonia cases and 915 normal chest X-ray images was used in this study. RESULTS: Among the three models, InceptionNetV3 yielded the best performance with accuracy levels of 98.63% and 99.02% with and without using data augmentation in model training, respectively. All the performed networks tend to overfitting (with high training accuracy) when data augmentation is not used, this is due to the limited amount of image data used for training and validation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a deep transfer learning is feasible to detect COVID-19 disease automatically from chest X-ray by training the learning model with chest X-ray images mixed with COVID-19 patients, other pneumonia affected patients and people with healthy lungs, which may help doctors more effectively make their clinical decisions. The study also gives an insight to how transfer learning was used to automatically detect the COVID-19 disease.

Methods A literature search was performed after PROSPERO registration (CRD42020200842) and reported in compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methods. We conducted a systematic search of Medline (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO/ICTRP from inception to November 20, 2020. Manuscripts and published abstracts were included if they involved testis-sparing surgery (TSS) and contained data on any outcomes related to fertility, hormonal parameters, or oncological control, or if they evaluated surgical technique. Results Our initial search yielded 3,370 manuscripts, with 269 of these screened for full-text eligibility. After our exclusion criteria were applied, 32 studies were included in the final analysis. Oncological outcomes were obtained from 12 studies (average follow-up 57.8 months), functional data from 26 studies (average follow-up 49.6 months), fertility information from 10 studies (average follow-up 55.8 months), and data on nonpalpable tumors from 11 studies (average follow-up 32.1 months). Oncological control appears to be excellent in studies that reported these outcomes. Presence of germ cell neoplasia in situ was controlled with adjuvant radiation in nearly all cases. Functional outcomes are also promising, as development of primary and compensated hypogonadism was rare. Semen parameters are poor preoperatively among men with benign and malignant testis tumors, with occasional decline after TSS. Frozen section analysis at the time of surgery appears to be very reliable, and the majority of nonpalpable tumors appear to be benign. Conclusions TSS is a safe and efficacious technique with regards to oncological control and postoperative hormonal function based on retrospective, noncontrolled studies. TSS avoids unnecessary removal of benign testicular tissue, and should be given serious consideration in cases of nonpalpable, small tumors under 2 cm. In cases of malignancy, TSS can safely avoid anorchia in men with bilateral tumors and in men with solitary testicles.

Such patients are often admitted in a context of acute-on-chronic liver failure with extrahepatic failures. Sequential assessment of scores or classification based on organ failures within the first days after admission help to stratify the risk of mortality in this population. Although the prognosis of severely ill cirrhotic patients has recently improved, transplant-free mortality remains high. LT is still the only curative treatment in this population. Yet, the increased relative scarcity of graft resource must be considered alongside the increased risk of losing a graft in the initial postoperative period when performing LT in too sick to transplant patients. Variables associated with poor immediate post-LT outcomes have been identified in large studies. Despite this, the performance of scores based on these variables is still insufficient. Consideration of a patients comorbidities and frailty is an appealing predictive approach in this population that has proven of great value in many other diseases. So far, local expertise remains the last safeguard to LT. Using this expertise, data are accumulating on favourable post-LT outcomes in very high MELD populations, particularly when LT is performed in a situation of stabilization/improvement of organ failures in selected candidates. The absence of definitive contraindications and the control of dynamic contraindications allow a transplantation window to be defined. This window must be identified swiftly after admission given the poor short-term survival of patients with very high MELD scores.

The saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) signal and chemical composition (assessed by HR-ICP-MS) of the moss samples indicated that the industrial route was the most polluted. Element fluxes (i.e., the ratio between element daily uptake and the specific leaf area) could discriminate among land uses; particularly, they were significantly higher in the industrial route for Ag, As, Cd and Pb; significantly lowest in the green route for As and Pb; and comparable for all accumulated elements along most urban routes.

Methods We sampled environmental surfaces including air from common areas in the cruise ship and cabins in which confirmed COVID-19 cases and non-cases had stayed after they left the cabins. We tested the samples for SARS-CoV-2 by rt-PCR and conducted viral isolation. Findings Of 601 samples tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from 58 samples (10%) from case-cabins from which they left 1-17 days before sampling, but not from non-case-cabins. Except for one sample from an air hood in a corridor, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from samples in common areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected from all 14 air samples. RNA was most often detected on the floor around toilet in the bathroom (39%, 13/33, cycle quantification (Cq): 26.21-37.62) and bed pillow (34%, 11/32, Cq: 34.61-38.99).

Ex vivo production of human platelets have been pursued as an alternative measure to resolve limitations in the supply and safety of current platelet transfusion products. To this end, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are considered an ideal global source, since they are not only pluripotent and self-renewing, but also are available from basically any person, have relatively few ethical issues, and are easy to manipulate. From human iPSCs, megakaryocyte (MK) lines with robust proliferation capacity have been established by the introduction of specified sets of genes. These expandable MKs are also cryopreservable and thus would be suitable as master cells for good manufacturing practice (GMP) grade production of platelets, assuring availability on demand and safety against blood-borne infections. Meanwhile, developments in bioreactors that physically mimic the in vivo environment and discovery of substances that promote thrombopoiesis have yielded competent platelets with improved efficiency. The derivation of platelets from iPSCs could further resolve transfusion-related alloimmune complications through the manufacturing of autologous products and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible platelets by manipulation of HLAs and human platelet antigens (HPAs). Considering these key advances in the field, HLA-deleted platelets could become a universal product that is manufactured at industrial level to safely fulfill almost all demands.

Currently, many viruses can be identified by sequencing without knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus. However, attributing the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease in the patient can be a challenge. One approach to meet this challenge is identification of viral sequences based on enrichment by autologous patient antibody capture. This method facilitates identification of viruses that have provoked an immune response within the patient and may increase the sensitivity of the current virus discovery techniques. To demonstrate the utility of this method, virus discovery deep sequencing (VIDISCA-454) was performed on clinical samples from 19 patients: 13 with a known respiratory viral infection and 6 with a known gastrointestinal viral infection. Patient sera was collected from one to several months after the acute infection phase. Input and antibody capture material was sequenced and enrichment was assessed. In 18 of the 19 patients, viral reads from immunogenic viruses were enriched by antibody capture (ranging between 1.5x to 343x in respiratory material, and 1.4x to 53x in stool). Enriched reads were also determined in an identity independent manner by using a novel algorithm Xcompare. In 16 of the 19 patients, 21% to 100% of the enriched reads were derived from infecting viruses.

Here, leveraging comprehensive single-cell analyses of in vitro SARS-CoV-2-infected human pancreatic islets, we demonstrate that productive infection is strictly dependent on the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and targets all pancreatic cell types. Importantly, the infection remains highly circumscribed, largely non-cytopathic, and despite high viral burden in infected subsets, promotes only modest cellular perturbations and inflammatory responses. Similar experimental outcomes are also observed after islet infection with endemic coronaviruses. Thus, the limits of pancreatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, even under in vitro conditions of enhanced virus exposure, do not support the proposition that in vivo targeting of beta cells by SARS-CoV-2 precipitates new-onset diabetes.

While chest CT scans are routinely performed in the initial assessment of patients with severe pulmonary forms, thymus involvement and reactivation have not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this observational study, we systematically scored the enlargement of the thymus and the lung involvement, using CT scans, in all adult patients admitted to the ICU for COVID or any other cause (control group) at one centre between March and April 2020. Initial biological investigations included nasal detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a subgroup of 24 patients with different degrees of pulmonary involvement and thymus hypertrophy, plasma cytokine concentrations were measured and the export of mature T cells from the thymus was estimated simultaneously by PCR quantification of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were studied: 50 COVID patients and 37 controls. Non-atrophic or enlarged thymus was more commonly observed in COVID patients than in controls (66% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001). Thymus enlargement in COVID patients was associated with more extensive lung injury score on CT scans (4 [3-5] vs. 2 [1.5-4], p = 0.01), but a lower mortality rate (8.6% vs. 41.2%, p < 0.001). Other factors associated with mortality were age, lymphopaenia, high CRP and co-morbidities. COVID patients had higher concentrations of IL-7 (6.00 [3.72-9.25] vs. 2.17 [1.76-4.4] pg/mL; p = 0.04) and higher thymic production of new lymphocytes (sj/?TREC ratio = 2.88 [1.98-4.51] vs. 0.23 [0.15-0.60]; p = 0.004). Thymic production was also correlated with the CT scan thymic score (r = 0.38, p = 0.03) and inversely correlated with the number of lymphocytes (r = 0.56, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In COVID patients, thymus enlargement was frequent and associated with increased T lymphocyte production, which appears to be a beneficial adaptation to virus-induced lymphopaenia. The lack of thymic activity/reactivation in older SARS-CoV-2 infected patients could contribute to a worse prognosis.","output":"Protective reactive thymus hyperplasia in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we target the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is a crucial enzyme for viral replication.

We have used normal mode analysis to support our claim of allosteric control for these sites. Further, we have performed virtual screening against the sites with 361 hits from Mpro screenings available through the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). We have identified the NCATS inhibitors that bind to the remote sites better than the active site of Mpro, and we propose these molecules may be allosteric regulators of the system.

There is high-quality evidence that intensification of treatment by either by adding concurrent chemotherapy or by altering radiotherapy (RT) fractionation improves outcomes in the curative-intent management of loco-regionally advanced HNSCC. Even conservative estimates indicate that >50% of patients in LMIC are unlikely to get access to timely RT, which will only get compounded with the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic.

inflammatory events to persist. Studies have shown that environmental co exposures alter the microbiome profile and cause long lasting systemic inflammation. This is common in the general population as well as a certain subsection of veterans having Gulf War Illness who were co exposed to organophosphates decades ago. With COVID19 pandemic claiming more than 335,000 deaths in USA alone, we aimed to study the susceptibility of SARS-COV-2 virus entry and its potential inflammatory mechanisms in the lung epithelial cells following co-exposure to IL6 and pesticide chlorpyrifos. Notably, a recent report confirms more than 160,000 positive SARS-COV-2 cases of veterans with mortality rate of more than 4%. Recent studies from our laboratory and others suggested that pesticide exposure during war theater and increased IL-6 in blood serum played pivotal role in physiological complications which include neurological and gastrointestinal disturbances. In the present report, we aim to identify whether pesticides and IL-6 co-exposure increases the risk of SARS-COV-2 infection by invitro studies with human lung airway epithelial cells. Cells were exposed to organophosphate Chlorpyriphos (20 g/ml) or human recombinant IL-6 (20 pg/ml) or with both for 6 h and treated with recombinant SARS-COV-2 spike protein (50 ng/ml) and observed for Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 expression (ACE2) on the apical or basolateral surface of airway epithelial cells. ACE-2 has been identified as putative receptor for SARS-COV-2 entry where it's spike protein pivotal to the entry of viral particle in cells. With reports showing abundant expression of ACE2 receptor protein to apical surface of polarized epithelial cells might support viral entry and replication in host cells, we performed Immunofluorescence microscopy to study ACE 2 protein expression in Apical cell surface (FoxJ1) or in basolateral cell surface (Sodium-Potassium ATPase 2). Results showed organophosphate and IL 6 exposure significantly increased ACE2 protein expression on the apical cell surface compared to when cells were unexposed or exposed with organophosphate alone. Furthermore, results showed that co exposure of IL 6 and organophosphate were instrumental in increased apoptosis of lung airway epithelial cells in presence of SARS-COV-2 spike protein compared to untreated cells. The following results though preliminary may pave the way for more mechanistic studies in rodent models to identify mechanisms of susceptibility of severe COVID19 outcomes in the general population and veterans who were co exposed to environmental agents in early life.","output":"Environmental organophosphate co-exposure in pre-existing systemic inflammation can Increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among prison system workers in the state of Esprito Santo, Brazil, between August-September 2020.

Inhaled methoxyflurane represents a promising treatment option; however, data in the elderly population are limited. Patients and Methods: Subgroup, post hoc analysis including 69 patients aged &#8805;65 years from a randomized, active-controlled, open-label study in the emergency setting. Key inclusion criterion was moderate-to-severe pain (Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] score &#8805; 4]) secondary to trauma in a single limb. Patients received inhaled methoxyflurane (3 mL) or standard analgesic treatment (SAT; IV paracetamol 1 g or ketoprofen 100 mg for moderate pain [NRS 4-6] and IV morphine 0.1mg/kg for severe pain [NRS &#8805;7]). The primary endpoint was the overall change in visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity from randomization to the next 3, 5, and 10 min. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of pain relief (TOPR), efficacy up to 30 min, judgment of operators and patients, and safety. Results: Pain reduction over time was similar in both groups. Median TOPR was shorter for methoxyflurane (9 min; 95% CI: 7.8, 10.2 min) than SAT (15 min; 95% CI: 10.2, 19.8 min). In terms of treatment satisfaction, patients and operators rated treatment efficacy and practicality, respectively, as \\"Excellent\\" or \\"Very good\\" 5.7 times and 3.4 times more frequently than SAT.

Multivariate meta-analysis (MVMA) incorporates outcome correlation and synthesises direct evidence and related outcome estimates within a single analysis. In a series of meta-analyses from the critically ill literature, the current study contrasts multiple univariate effect estimates and their precision with those derived from MVMA. METHODS: A previous meta-epidemiological study was used to identify meta-analyses with either one or two secondary outcomes providing sufficient detail to structure bivariate or tri-variate MVMA, with mortality as primary outcome. Analysis was performed using a random effects model for both odds ratio (OR) and risk ratio (RR); borrowing of strength (BoS) between multivariate outcome estimates was reported. Estimate comparisons,  coefficients, standard errors (SE) and confidence interval (CI) width, univariate versus multivariate, were performed using Lins concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). RESULTS: In bivariate meta-analyses, for OR (n = 49) and RR (n = 48), there was substantial concordance ( 0.69) between estimates; but this was less so for tri-variate meta-analyses for both OR (n = 25;  0.38) and RR ( -0.10; n = 22). A variable change in the multivariate precision of primary mortality outcome estimates compared with univariate was present for both bivariate and tri-variate meta-analyses and for metrics. For second outcomes, precision tended to decrease and CI width increase for bivariate meta-analyses, but was variable in the tri-variate. For third outcomes, precision increased and CI width decreased. In bivariate meta-analyses, OR coefficient significance reversal, univariate versus MVMA, occurred once for mortality and 6 cases for second outcomes. RR coefficient significance reversal occurred in 4 cases; 2 were discordant with OR. For tri-variate OR meta-analyses reversal of coefficient estimate significance occurred in two cases for mortality, nine cases for second and 7 cases for third outcomes. In RR meta-analyses significance reversals occurred for mortality in 2 cases, 6 cases for second and 3 cases for third; there were 7 discordances with OR.

Patients diagnosed with EVALI have used vape products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and vitamin E acetate (VEA). Hypothesis We hypothesized that inhalation of these EVALI vape cartridges and their constituents induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury, and alters SARS-CoV-2 related proteins. Methods Vaping products were recovered from hospitalized patients at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Cartridge constituents were characterized by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Comparative toxicity of exposure to common vape cartridge components such as medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, VEA, and patient-derived cartridge aerosols was assessed by in vitro and in vivo models. Lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and monocytes (Mono-Mac-6). Cells were exposed to MCT, VEA, and cartridge aerosols and the elicited inflammatory response, barrier function, and lipid-laden index were determined. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MCT, VEA, and vape cartridge aerosols for three days (1 hr/day). The immune response was determined by differential cell counts, cytokine milieu, and lipidomics analysis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lung surfactant protein (SP-A), SARS-CoV-2 proteins (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) were quantified in the lung homogenates. Results Constituents identified patient-derived vaping products included reactive hydrocarbons and various forms of cannabinoids. VEA and cartridge aerosols induced significantly increased IL-6 and IL-8 responses in lung epithelial cells and monocytes. MCT, VEA, and cartridge aerosols induced barrier dysfunction. Increased lipid-laden indices were observed in MM6 cells. In mice, acute exposure to cartridge aerosols caused a significant infiltration of leukocytes in BALF and increased IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the BALF. Lipidomics analysis showed significantly increased eicosanoid inflammatory mediators and leukotrienes. Reduced levels of SP-A levels were seen in lung homogenates. Exposure to cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. SARS-CoV-2 related proteins were not affected. Conclusion Acute exposure to vape cartridges induces cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and elicit an inflammatory response in lung cells and mice, which are potential predictive toxicological markers of EVALI. Toxicity of vape cartridges was independent of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. This study provides important identification of potential chemical constituents, toxicological responses, and potential biomarkers of EVALI.","output":"Toxicological assessment of e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) cartridges and constituents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the cause of the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Vitamin D is thought to play a role in many chronic diseases as it may possess immunomodulatory properties. This article will review the role of vitamin D regulation on the immune system and its potential implication in the pathophysiology of asthma. RECENT FINDINGS vitamin D receptors are present on many cells in the body, specifically peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Vitamin D has been shown to regulate the balance of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in the immune system. Studies have suggested that prenatal vitamin D intake has an effect on childhood wheezing and asthma. Additionally, vitamin D may play a role in asthma exacerbations, and recent evidence also suggests its importance in steroid resistant asthma. SUMMARY vitamin D has a complex role on the immune system and its regulation of various aspects of immunity has allowed speculation on its potential role in asthma. However, the net effect of vitamin D on the immune system and its role in asthma still remains unanswered. More research needs to address the diagnostic and therapeutic implications vitamin D may have in the future of asthma management.","output":"Vitamin D and asthma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, which causes severe respiratory tract infections in humans, has become a global health concern and is spreading rapidly. At present, the most important issue associated with COVID-19 is the immune system and the factors that affect it. It is well known that cows milk is highly rich in micronutrients that increase and strengthen the immune system. Research shows that the administration of these nutrients is very effective in fighting COVID-19, and a deficiency in any of them can be a weakness in the fight against the virus. On the other hand, cows milk is accessible to the whole population, and drinking colostrum, raw, and micro-filtered milk from cows vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 could provide individuals with short-term protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infection until vaccines become commercially available. This review aimed to discuss the effects of milk vitamins, minerals, and bioactive peptides on general health in humans to combat viral diseases, especially COVID-19, and to what extent cows milk consumption plays a role in providing these metabolites. Cows milk contains many bioactive compounds that include vitamins, minerals, biogenic amines, nucleotides, oligosaccharides, organic acids, and immunoglobulins. Humans can meet a significant portion of their requirements for vitamins and minerals through the consumption of cows milk.

We wanted to conduct a European survey to determine the preference of treatment in different clinical situations. Materials & Methods: A European survey was conducted via the EAU sections (YAU and ESUT) for preference and treatment choices between radiologists and urologists for using PCN or RUS or primary ureteroscopy (URS) in various clinical scenarios. Responders were asked to select urinary drainage for 3 clinical scenarios before and after reading evidence from literature on use of PCN or RUS. The scenarios were ureteric stone related C infected obstructed kidney (scenario 1), obese patient with pain and hydronephrosis (scenario 2) and solitary kidney with deranged renal function (scenario 3). Results: Of the responses (n=367), there were 15.4% (n=57) radiologists and 310 (84.5%) urologists.

Most of the modeling and predictions were based on compartmental epidemiologic models and a few used advanced machine learning techniques. While some models have accurately predicted the end of the epidemic in some countries, other predictions strongly deviate from reality. Interestingly, some studies showed that combining artificial intelligence with classical compartmental models provides a better prediction of the disease spread. Assumptions made when parameterizing the models might be wrong and might not suit the local contexts and might partly explain the observed deviation from the reality on the ground.

However, conventional PPEs lack virucidal capabilities and arbitrarily discarding used PPEs may cause a high risk for cross-contamination and environmental pollution. Recently reported photothermal or photodynamic-mediated self-sterilizing masks show bactericidal-virucidal abilities but have some inherent disadvantages, such as generating unbearable heat during the photothermal process or requiring additional ultraviolet light irradiation to inactivate pathogens, which limit their practical applications. Here, we report the fabrication of a series of fabrics (derived from various PPEs) with real-time self-antiviral capabilities, on the basis of a highly efficient aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (namely, ASCP-TPA). ASCP-TPA possesses facile synthesis, excellent biocompatibility, and extremely high reactive oxygen species generation capacity, which significantly outperforms the traditional photosensitizers. Meanwhile, the ASCP-TPA-attached fabrics (ATaFs) show tremendous photodynamic inactivation effects against MHV-A59, a surrogate coronavirus of SARS-CoV-2. Upon ultralow-power white light irradiation (3.0 mW cm-2), >99.999% virions (5 log) on the ATaFs are eliminated within 10 min. Such ultralow-power requirement and rapid virus-killing ability enable ATaFs-based PPEs to provide real-time protection for the wearers under indoor light irradiation. ATaFs' virucidal abilities are retained after 100 washings or continuous exposure to office light for 2 weeks, which offers the benefits of reusability and long-term usability. Furthermore, ATaFs show no toxicity to normal skin, even upon continuous high-power light illumination.

Since the last systematic review has been published in 2008, which didnt find conclusive evidence favoring its use, two more RCTs have also been completed. METHODS: Relevant electronic databases were searched with a suitable combination of Medical Subject Headings terms to detect publications describing RCTs exploring the safety and efficacy of vinpocetine in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The risk of bias was determined by using the Cochrane Collaborations tool for assessing the risk of bias in RCTs after full-text review and relevant data extraction. Higgins and Thompsons I(2) method was used to assess heterogeneity in studies. The presence of publication bias was assessed by Eggers test. We used a random effect model when I(2) was more than 50% and a fixed-effect model for other parameters. RESULTS: Four placebo-controlled RCTs enrolling a total of 601 and 236 patients in vinpocetine and placebo groups, respectively, were included. The number of patients with death or significant disability was lower in the vinpocetine group than that in the placebo group at both 1 and 3 months (relative risk 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65C0.99 and relative risk 0.67, CI 0.48C0.92, p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). The degree of disability in participants at 1 month and 3 months was also lower in vinpocetine group than that in the placebo group (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.49, 95% CI 0.03C0.95 and SMD 1.22, CI 0.23C2.24, p = 0.001 and 0.04, respectively). Change in mini-mental state examination score compared with baseline at trial enrolment was also better in the vinpocetine group than in the placebo group (pooled weighted mean difference 0.92, 95% CI 0.02C1.82, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Vinpocetine has some promising efficacy in patients with ischemic stroke when used in the acute stage in reducing the disability, but presently there is not enough evidence to suggest that it also reduces case fatality. More double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs of adequate sample size are needed before making recommendations for the routine administration of vinpocetine for all patients with acute ischemic stroke.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-five markers placed in the tumor volumes of 24 esophageal cancer patients were identified in computed tomography (CT) and follow-up cone-beam CT. For each patient we calculated pairwise distances between markers over time to evaluate geometric tumor volume variation. We then quantified marker displacements relative to bony anatomy and estimated the variation of systematic () and random errors (). During bony anatomy-based setup verification, we visually inspected whether the markers were inside the planning target volume (PTV) and attempted marker-based registration. RESULTS Minor time trends with substantial fluctuations in pairwise distances implied tissue deformation. Overall, () in the left-right/cranial-caudal/anterior-posterior direction was 2.9(2.4)/4.1(2.4)/2.2(1.8) mm; for the proximal stomach, it was 5.4(4.3)/4.9(3.2)/1.9(2.4) mm. After bony anatomy-based setup correction, all markers were inside the PTV. However, due to large tissue deformation, marker-based registration was not feasible. CONCLUSIONS Generally, the interfractional position variation of esophageal tumors is more pronounced in the cranial-caudal direction and in the proximal stomach. Currently, marker-based setup verification is not feasible for clinical routine use, but markers can facilitate the setup verification by inspecting whether the PTV covers the tumor volume adequately.","output":"Marker-based quantification of interfractional tumor position variation and the use of markers for setup verification in radiation therapy for esophageal cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put the clinical laboratory in the spotlight.

Patients/Methods An open cohort study was conducted to collect information of the general population during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. We analyzed data from 5011 participants (16 years) who answered a weekly questionnaire about their well-being. Two questions about the frequency of insomnia and nightmares about COVID-19 were consecutively applied during six weeks (March-May 2020). Latent class analysis was conducted and different insomnia and nightmare profiles were identified. Associations between individual characteristics and both profiles were estimated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Five insomnia (No insomnia, Stable-mild, Decreasing-moderate, Stable-severe, Increasing-severe) and three nightmares profiles (Stable-mild, Stable-moderate, Stable-severe) were identified, respectively. Being female, younger, perceiving their income as insufficient and feelings of fear towards COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of insomnia (Women: OR=6.98 95%CI:4.18-11.64;60 years: OR=0.30 95%CI:0.18-0.53);Insufficient income: aOR=8.413 95%CI:3.93-16.84;Often presenting fear of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection: aOR=9.13 95%CI:6.36-13.11), and nightmares (Women: OR=2.60 95%CI:1.74-3.86;60 years: OR=0.45 95%CI:0.28-0.74) Insufficient income: aOR=2.60 95%CI:1.20-5.20;Often/almost always presenting fear of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection: aOR=6.62 95%CI:5.01-8.74).

The objective of this study was to identify the impact of the pandemic on workplace violence at an academic emergency department (ED). METHODS: This mixed-methods study involved a prospective descriptive survey study and electronic medical record review. Within our hospital referral region (HRR), the first COVID-19 case was documented on 3/11/2020 and cases peaked in mid-November 2020. We compared the monthly HRR COVID-19 case rate per 100,000 people to the rate of violent incidents per 1000 ED visits. Multidisciplinary ED staff were surveyed both pre/early-pandemic (April 2020) and mid/late-pandemic (December 2020) regarding workplace violence experienced over the prior 6-months. The study was deemed exempt by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: There was a positive association between the monthly HRR COVID-19 case rate and rate of violent ED incidents (r = 0.24). Violent incidents increased overall during the pandemic (2.53 incidents per 1000 visits) compared to the 3 months prior (1.13 incidents per 1000 visits, p < .001), as well as compared to the previous year (1.24 incidents per 1000 patient visits, p < .001).

We evaluated the feasibility of adding HBV testing and treatment of pregnant women and birth-dose vaccination of HBV-exposed infants to the HIV prevention of MTCT (PMTCT) program infrastructure in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where HBV treatment and birth-dose vaccination programs are not established. Methods: As part of the HIV PMTCT program at two maternity centers in Kinshasa, DRC, pregnant women were screened for HBV at routine prenatal care registration. Pregnant women with high viral load and/or HBeAg positivity were offered tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). HBV-exposed infants received a birth-dose of HBV vaccine within 24 hours of life. The primary endpoint was the feasibility and acceptability of the study. Results: Of 4,016 women screened, 109 (2.7%) were HBsAg-positive. Ten of 91 (11.1%) women evaluated had high-risk disease. Of 88 infants, 60 (68.2%) received a birth-dose vaccine; of these, 46 (76.7%) received a timely birth-dose. No cases of HBV MTCT were observed in our cohort. There were no serious adverse events associated with TDF nor with birth-dose vaccine. The study procedures were highly acceptable (>80%) among mothers. Conclusions: Adding HBV screening and treatment of pregnant women and infant birth-dose vaccination to existing HIV PMTCT platforms is feasible in countries like the DRC.

Smartphone and wearable devices may offer a unique source of data to detect moment by moment changes in risk factors associated with mental disorders that overcome many of the limitations of traditional screening methods. Objective: The current study aimed to explore the extent to which data from smartphone and wearable devices could predict symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: A total of N = 60 adults (ages 24C68) who owned an Apple iPhone and Oura Ring were recruited online over a 2-week period. At the beginning of the study, participants installed the Delphi data acquisition app on their smartphone. The app continuously monitored participants' location (using GPS) and smartphone usage behavior (total usage time and frequency of use). The Oura Ring provided measures related to activity (step count and metabolic equivalent for task), sleep (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and time in bed) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, participants were prompted to report their daily mood (valence and arousal). Participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21) at baseline, midpoint and the end of the study. Results: Multilevel models demonstrated a significant negative association between the variability of locations visited and symptoms of depression (beta = ?0.21, p = 0.037) and significant positive associations between total sleep time and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.023), time in bed and depression (beta = 0.26, p = 0.020), wake after sleep onset and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.035) and HRV and anxiety (beta = 0.26, p = 0.035).

The medical charts of 72 transgender men with 147 urethral strictures were reviewed. The primary outcomes were the success and recurrence rates after surgical treatment for urethral strictures. RESULTS At last follow-up (median of 61 (IQR 25-202) months), 50/72 (69%) were able to void while standing (after one (60%), two (20%), three (6%), four (8%), five (4%), or seven (2%) procedures), 10/72 (14%) awaited further treatment, 2/72 (3%) sat to void in despite of good urodynamic function, and 10/72 (14%) had a definitive urethrostomy. Of 104 surgical treatments included in separate success rate analysis, 65 (63%) were successful (43/75 (57%) after phalloplasty, 22/29 (76%) after metoidioplasty). Highest success rates in short urethral strictures were seen after Heineke-Mikulicz procedure (6/7, 86%), and in longer or more complicated urethral strictures after two-stage with graft (4/6, 67%), two-stage without graft (10/12, 83%), pedicled flap (11/15, 73%), and single-stage graft (7/7, 100%) urethroplasties.

Transcription factors share their binding sites with other factors, co-factors and/or DNA-binding proteins. These proteins form complexes which bind to the DNA as one-units. The binding of two factors to a shared site does not always lead to a functional interaction. RESULTS: We propose a method to predict the combined functions of two factors using comparable binding and expression data (target). We based this method on binding and expression target analysis (BETA), which we re-implemented in R and extended for this purpose. target ranks the factor's targets by importance and predicts the dominant type of interaction between two transcription factors. We applied the method to simulated and real datasets of transcription factor-binding sites and gene expression under perturbation of factors. We found that Yin Yang 1 transcription factor (YY1) and YY2 have antagonistic and independent regulatory targets in HeLa cells, but they may cooperate on a few shared targets.

Bulk material handling is ideal when the bulk material is loaded centrally onto the downstream conveyor. Furthermore, feeding in conveying direction of the downstream belt conveyor and a material deflection by the chute with minimum wear are also required for ideal bulk material handling.

It is more commonly known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); the pandemic threat continues to spread aroundthe world with the fluctuating emergence of its new variants. The severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to serious acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has led to a high human mortality rate and disruption of socioeconomic well-being. For the restoration of pre-pandemic normalcy, the international scientific community has been conducting research on a war footing to limit extremely pathogenic COVID-19 through diagnosis, treatment, and immunization. Since the first report of COVID-19 viral infection, an array of laboratory-based and point-of-care (POC) approaches have emerged for diagnosing and understanding its status of outbreak. The RT-PCR-based viral nucleic acid test (NAT) is one of the rapidly developed and most used COVID-19 detection approaches. Notably, the current forbidding status of COVID-19 requires the development of safe, targeted vaccines/vaccine injections (shots) that can reduce its associated morbidity and mortality. Massive and accelerated vaccination campaigns would be the most effective and ultimate hope to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak, emerging biotechnologies and their multidisciplinary approaches have accelerated the understanding of molecular details as well as the development of a wide range of diagnostics and potential vaccine candidates, which are indispensable to combating the highly contagious COVID-19. Several vaccine candidates have completed phase III clinical studies and are reported to be effective in immunizing against COVID-19 after their rollout via emergency use authorization (EUA). However, optimizing the type of vaccine candidates and its route of delivery that works best to control viral spread is crucial to face the threatening variants expected to emerge over time.

The reported prevalence is 17-39% in ill referral patients. While the aetiology is poorly understood, it is known to include infectious, autoimmune and physical components. What is not known is whether different organs are affected by different diseases, or the same process; indeed, triaditis may be part of a multiorgan inflammatory disease. Feline gastrointestinal tract anatomy plays its role too. Specifically, the short small intestine, high bacterial load and anatomic feature whereby the pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct before entering the duodenal papilla all increase the risk of bacterial reflux and parenchymal inflammation. Inflammation may also be a sequela of bowel bacterial translocation and systemic bacteraemia. DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES Cholangitis, pancreatitis and IBD manifest with overlapping, vague and non-specific clinical signs. Cholangitis may be accompanied by increased serum liver enzymes, total bilirubin and bile acid concentrations, and variable ultrasonographic changes. A presumptive diagnosis of pancreatitis is based on increased serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity or feline pancreas-specific lipase, and/or abnormal pancreatic changes on ultrasonography, though these tests have low sensitivity. Diagnosis of IBD is challenging without histopathology; ultrasound findings vary from normal to mucosal thickening or loss of layering. Triaditis may cause decreased serum folate or cobalamin (B12) concentrations due to intestinal disease and/or pancreatitis. Triaditis can only be confirmed with histopathology; hence, it remains a presumptive diagnosis in most cases. EVIDENCE BASE The literature on feline triaditis, pancreatitis, cholangitis and IBD is reviewed, focusing on histopathology, clinical significance and diagnostic challenges. Current management recommendations are provided.

METHODS: Between April 23-May 7, 2020, we electronically administered a survey to physicians, nurses, respiratory therapist (RTs) and advanced practice providers (APPs) caring for COVID-19 patients in the US. We conducted multivariate regression to assess associations between concerns, reported lack of resources and three outcomes: emotional distress/burnout (primary outcome), and two secondary outcomes: 1) fear that hospital is unable to keep providers safe, and 2) concern about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community. RESULTS: We included 1,651 respondents from all 50 states; 47% nurses, 25% physicians, 17% RTs, 11% APPS. Shortages of intensivists and ICU nurses were reported by 12% and 28% of providers, respectively. The largest supply restrictions reported were for powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs); (56% reporting restricted availability). Provider concerns included worries about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community (66%), emotional distress/burnout (58%), and insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) (40%). After adjustment, emotional distress/burnout was significantly associated with insufficient PPE access (aRR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.32 - 1.55), stigma from community (aRR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.24 - 1.41), and poor communication with supervisors (aRR:1.13, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.21).

This pandemic also represents a major challenge for statisticians involved in quantifying the phenomenon and in offering timely tools for the monitoring and surveillance of critical pandemic parameters. In a recent paper, Alleva et al. (2020) proposed a two-stage sample design to build a continuous-time surveillance system designed to correctly quantify the number of infected people through an indirect sampling mechanism that could be repeated in several waves over time to capture different target variables in the different stages of epidemic development. The proposed method exploits the indirect sampling (Lavalle, 2007;Kiesl, 2016) method employed in the estimation of rare and elusive populations (Borchers, 2009;Lavalle and Rivest, 2012) and a capture/recapture mechanism (Sudman, 1988;Thompson and Seber, 1996). In this paper, we extend the proposal of Alleva et al. (2020) to include a spatial sampling mechanism (Mller, 1998;Grafstr?m et al., 2012, Jauslin and Till, 2020) in the process of data collection to achieve the same level of precision with fewer sample units, thereby facilitating the process of data collection in a situation where timeliness and costs are crucial elements.

Third, network analyses show increasingly diverse and multi\\\\centred communities behind ordinance proposals;this suggests a move from personalistic politics to institutionalised politics.","output":"Local government performance and democratic consolidation: Explaining ordinance proposal in Busan Metropolitan Council"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has a serious impact on health care workers both physically and psychologically since they become more susceptible to COVID-19 infection due to frequent exposure to individuals infected by COVID-19, work pressure, inadequate conditions of protective equipment, and the accuracy of decision making. This study aims to identify factors affecting the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. Methods: The study used the literature review method, with article searches on five databases, namely PubMed, EBSCOhost, MEDLINE, ProQuest, and google scholar. The searching process for articles used keywords, including related word synonyms and MESH. The number of the research articles identified included PubMed, EBSCOhost, MEDLINE, ProQuest and google scholar, with 1302. The next step was to use prism chart analysis and select 15 journals that met the inclusion and predefined exclusion criteria. Results: The research analysis results showed that the health workers who were most affected by the COVID-19 transmission were the nursing profession. Factors that influenced the message of COVID-19 in hospitals included internal factors, such as comorbidities, work experience, education and training, stress, hand hygiene, and external factors: hospital environmental design, reduction of personal protective equipment, culture and ethnicity, government policies. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic that has not ended requires changes in the design of care facilities, culture, the behavior of health workers, government policies that can break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 to health workers in hospitals.","output":"Factors affecting the occurrence of covid-19 transmission on health workers: a literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleoside analogues are at the forefront of antiviral therapy for last decades. To circumvent some of their limitations, based on their metabolism, and in order to improve their anti-viral potency and selectivity, several families of nucleoside analogues have been described through structural modifications at the sugar and heterocycles. The replacement of the oxygen of the nucleoside by a methylene has led to the family of carbocyclic (or cyclopentane) nucleoside analogues. Various potent anti-HIV and anti-HBV drugs belong to this family. Main syntheses of carbocyclic analogues of nucleosides used Diels-Alder reactions (in racemic or asymmetric series), but also started from carbohydrates (ribose, glucose), as a source of optically active compounds, which then had to be transformed into carbacycles under various conditions. The growing interest in carbocyclic nucleosides has led several groups, including ours, to develop new analogues and to explore novel routes. This article will review some of the recent chemistry developed on selected five-membered ring carbocyclic nucleosides.","output":"Chemical Approaches to Carbocyclic Nucleosides."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the prevalence of dust events has increased in the region and the world.

We created a risk prediction model for AN to help decide which test might be preferred, a use not considered for existing models. DESIGN Average-risk 50-to-80-year olds undergoing first-time screening colonoscopy were recruited from endoscopy units in Indiana. We measured sociodemographic and physical features, medical and family history and lifestyle factors and linked these to the most advanced finding. We derived a risk equation on two-thirds of the sample and assigned points to each variable to create a risk score. Scores with comparable risks were collapsed into risk categories. The model and score were tested on the remaining sample. RESULTS Among 3025 subjects in the derivation set (mean age 57.3 (6.5) years; 52% women), AN prevalence was 9.4%. The 13-variable model (c-statistic=0.77) produced three risk groups with AN risks of 1.5% (95% CI 0.72% to 2.74%), 7.06% (CI 5.89% to 8.38%) and 27.26% (CI 23.47% to 31.30%) in low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk groups (p value <0.001), containing 23%, 59% and 18% of subjects, respectively. In the validation set of 1475 subjects (AN prevalence of 8.4%), model performance was comparable (c-statistic=0.78), with AN risks of 2.73% (CI 1.25% to 5.11%), 5.57% (CI 4.12% to 7.34%) and 25.79% (CI 20.51% to 31.66%) in low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk subgroups, respectively (p<0.001), containing proportions of 23%, 59% and 18%. CONCLUSION Among average-risk persons, this model estimates AN risk with high discrimination, identifying a lower risk subgroup that may be screened non-invasively and a higher risk subgroup for which colonoscopy may be preferred. The model could help guide patient-provider discussions of screening options, may increase screening adherence and conserve colonoscopy resources.","output":"Derivation and validation of a predictive model for advanced colorectal neoplasia in asymptomatic adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Remote spirometry measures performed by means of handheld spirometers connected to smartphone applications have gained increased attention as a convenient data collection technique for patients. Additionally, this method provides more frequent data than clinical visits and allows researchers to control for data variability (diurnal variation, seasonal/environmental changes) by increasing statistical degrees of freedom. Moreover, remote and clinic spirometry data was shown to be comparable in patients with asthma and COPD. The need for remote assessments became more acute during the COVID-19 pandemic when healthcare professionals were urged to keep clinic visits to an absolute minimum to minimize the risk of infection to patients. However, a concern about remote spirometry modality is related to patient compliance remains valid: will patients perform spirometry maneuvers remotely while unsupervised? METHODS We analyzed remote spirometry compliance data from 2 clinical trials of patients with mild to moderate asthma conducted in the US and 1 in the UK. The former were single centers studies of 28-day duration and recruited 32 subjects. The latter was a multicenter study which recruited 39 subjects for 5-6 months;however only the first 28-day treatment data was analyzed to match the timeframe of the other studies. The study subjects received both experimental and standard of care treatments. All study subjects were instructed to perform pulmonary function tests at home twice daily, received a handheld spirometer, a dedicated smart phone along with training how to perform spirometry maneuvers remotely. All studies deployed mobile spirometer devices that synchronize with the smartphone application. Patients were asked to contribute spirometry data at predefined time windows (morning and evening). Compliance rates were calculated as a percentage of pulmonary function tests comprising a minimum of 2 complete maneuvers twice daily versus twice days on study. RESULTS The twice daily data compliance across three studies was 88.9%, the compliance for performing spirometry maneuvers within the specified time windows was 85% and compliance for no missing day during the study period was 83%. Additionally, we analyzed the number of compliant subjects over time across all studies: the number of compliant subjects did not decline over the period of 28 days. Moreover, the compliance analysis stratified by the time of the day and weekday/weekend demonstrated no difference in compliance. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate good compliance for remote spirometry data collection for 28-day period indicating that remote spirometry data collection is feasible in the multi-center clinical trials recruiting asthma patients. .","output":"Compliance analysis for remote spirometry in subjects with mild to moderate asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to explore student and staff perceptions and experiences of a pilot COVID-19 asymptomatic testing service (P-ATS) in a UK university campus setting.

Ninety-nine students (84.8% female, 70% first year;93.9% P-ATS participants) completed an online survey, 41 individuals attended interviews or focus groups, including 31 students (21 first year;10 final year) and 10 staff. All types of testing and logistics were highly acceptable (virus: swab, saliva;antibody: finger prick) and 94.9% would participate again. Reported adherence to weekly virus testing was high (92.4% completed 6 tests;70.8% submitted all 10 swabs;89.2% completed 1 saliva sample) and 76.9% submitted 3 blood samples. Students tested to keep campus safe, contribute to national efforts to control COVID-19, and protect others. 31.3% had high anxiety as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) (27.1% of first year). Students with lower levels of anxiety and greater satisfaction with university communications around P-ATS were more likely to adhere to virus and antibody tests. Increased adherence to testing was associated with higher perceived risk of COVID-19 to self (virus) and others (antibody). Qualitative findings revealed 5 themes and 13 sub-themes: emotional responses to COVID-19, university life during COVID-19, influences on testing participation, testing physical and logistical factorsand testing effects on mental wellbeing. Asymptomatic COVID-19 testing (virus/antibodies) is highly acceptable to students and staff in a university campus setting.

However, most overdose prevention interventions, such as supervised consumption services (SCS), prohibit inhalation. In addition, women are underrepresented at SCS and are disproportionately impacted by socio-structural violence. This study examines womens experiences smoking illicit drugs during an overdose epidemic, including their utilization of a women-only supervised inhalation site. METHODS: Qualitative research methods included on-site ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews with 32 participants purposively recruited from the women-only site. Data were coded and analyzed using NVivo 12 and thematic analysis was informed by gendered and socio-structural understandings of violence. RESULTS: Participants had preferences for smoking drugs and these were shaped by their limited income, inability to inject, and perceptions of overdose risk. Participants expressed the need for services that attend to womens specific experiences of gendered, race-based, and structural violence faced within and outside mixed-gender social service settings. Results indicate a need for sanctioned spaces that recognize polysubstance use and drug smoking, accommodated by the women-only SCS. The smoking environment further fostered a sociability where participants could engage in perceived harm reduction through sharing drugs with other women/those in need and were able to respond in the event of an overdose. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate the ways in which gendered social and structural environments shape womens daily experiences using drugs and the need for culturally appropriate interventions that recognize diverse modes of consumption while attending to overdose and violence. Women-only smoking spaces can provide temporary reprieve from some socio-structural harms and build collective capacity to practice harm reduction strategies, including overdose prevention. Women-specific SCS with attention to polysubstance use are needed as well as continued efforts to address the socio-structural harms experienced by women who smoke illicit drugs.","output":"Hoots and harm reduction: a qualitative study identifying gaps in overdose prevention among women who smoke drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 infections among healthcare workers were widely reported in China and Europe as the pandemic expanded to the United States.

The engineering performance of the prototypes was measured and safety validated using National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-equivalent tests on apparatus available under pandemic conditions at university laboratories. Feedback was obtained from four individuals; two clinicians working in ambulatory clinical care and two research technical staff for whom PAPR use is standard occupational PPE; these individuals were asked to compare PanFab prototypes to commercial PAPRs from the perspective of usability and suggest areas for improvement. Respondents rated the PanFab Custom PAPR a 4 to 5 on a 5 Likert-scale 1) as compared to current PPE options, 2) for the sense of security with use in a clinical setting, and 3) for comfort compared to standard, commercially available PAPRs.

While little research has been conducted to understand the impacts of different travel modes on the transmission of COVID-19, without an explicit understanding of the travel mode effects, many people intuitively perceive non-motorized travel modes to be safer than public transit as passengers in public transit are confined to small, enclosed spaces where the virus can transmit more easily. During the period when urban mobility gradually returns towards what was called normal and transit systems and urban facilities reopen, new waves of the pandemic might be generated as travel mode choices significantly differ across cities and different travel behaviors are associated with diverse infectious sources. Thus, the current study focuses on understanding the impact of different travel modes on the transmission of COVID-19 in the long-term and at world-wide scales, aspects that have not received much attention in the research literature. Accordingly, a multivariate time series analysis has been developed to examine the impacts of daily confirmed cases and travel modes, based on driving, public transit, and walking as recorded in the Apple Mobility Trends Reports on COVID-19 transmission risks in 71 cities throughout the world from January to November 2020. The impact of population density in built-up areas and the degree to which the \`wearing' of facemasks affects infections are also investigated. Among the three travel modes we examine, driving is the safest way to commute because drivers are physically separate from crowds. Unexpectedly, walking has a relatively low risk when the population density in built-up areas is high, which suggests that, globally, people have increased awareness of pandemic prevention. Although the general public is more worried about using public transit, this mode can still be safe in many large cities, a factor that is vital for informing policy making and developing trust among citizens so they will continue to commute using public transit when strict preventative measures are in place. From another perspective, infectious sources make the largest contribution to daily confirmed cases, thus demonstrating the importance of strict quarantine measures to block the source of infection. The results and conclusions presented herein are based on an analysis of spatio-temporal data that helps inform policy making and enable cities to be kept open when controlling the pandemic, which has become an urgent task for the international community when rebuilding the economy.","output":"The effects of different travel modes on COVID-19 transmission in global cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kurikulum merupakan fondasi yang digunakan dalam melaksanakan pembelajaran di PAUD.

Lifestyle behaviors were self-reported by a multidimensional scale (SMILE-C). Two separate samples of respondents were analyzed. A multivariate regression model was performed to evaluate the association of SMILE-C scores with demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: The sample comprised, 3412 participants from the first survey (S1) and in the S1 and 3635 from the second (S2). SMILE-C score decreased across surveys (p < 0.001). The rates of positive screenings for depression and anxiety were similar between the surveys, whereas those for alcohol abuse decreased (p < 0.001).

The most affected countries of the world are USA, Brazil, India, Italy, Iran, Spain, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom and Peru. In Pakistan, the pilgrims from Iran became the major source of spread of the virus in the country, as the Government did not impose quarantine measures to restrict their movement. In Pakistan, the most affected province was Sindh followed by Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. According to WHO, the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue and diarrhea and shortness of breath in severe cases. The virus attacks throat, lungs and trachea converting them to virus factories to infect more cells. It attacks not only lungs but also other vital organs of the body like kidneys and heart. It is spread from human to human through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Moreover, there have been reports of the mixed infection of coronavirus with other bacteria, fungi and viruses. Various methods are used for the detection of the virus such as nucleic acid and immunological methods but RT-PCR is considered as the most reliable. Some antiviral drugs have shown to be effective against the virus like Favilavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, hydroxy-chloroquine, Tocilizumab etc. but further clinical studies are required to confirm their efficacy. In Pakistan, blood plasma therapy is in high demand but involves the risk of transmission of blood borne pathogens. As Pakistan lacks medical facilities. the government has to get testing kits and primers from other countries. Only few quarantine centers are available and there is shortage of drugs, beds, trained doctors and paramedical staff. Unfortunately, no vaccine is available yet so the only management strategy is the prevention of infection by wearing masks and following social distancing.

Newborn screening and timely galactose-restricted diet can resolve acute symptoms and decrease fatalities. However, despite this, significant chronic, progressive morbidities remain which have a real impact upon daily life. To better understand the burden of disease, 20 in-depth qualitative interviews were undertaken with adult patients (n = 12), and their caregivers (n = 8), enrolled in the ACTION-Galactosemia trial, part of a clinical program designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of AT-007 (govorestat) in reducing toxic galactitol and long-term clinical outcomes in Classic Galactosemia. RESULTS: Interviews revealed the substantial burden of Classic Galactosemia on patients and families. Most adults were not able to live independently, and all required support with day-to-day activities. Short- and long-term memory difficulties and tremors were identified as the most frequently experienced and challenging symptoms. Other difficulties such as fine motor skills and slow/slurred speech contribute to the significant impact on daily activities, affecting ability to communicate and interact with others. Symptoms were first noticed in early childhood and worsened with age. Classic Galactosemia impacted all areas of daily functioning and quality of life, leading to social isolation, anxiety, anger/frustration and depression. This demonstrates the significant burden of disease and challenges associated with Classic Galactosemia. CONCLUSIONS: The impact on both patients and caregivers underscores the severity of the unmet medical need and the importance of pharmacological intervention to halt or prevent disease progression. Any treatment that could reduce symptoms or slow functional decline would ease the burden of this condition on patients and caregivers.","output":"Qualitative interviews with adults with Classic Galactosemia and their caregivers: disease burden and challenges with daily living"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drake TM, Riad AM, Fairfield CJ, et al.

METHODS: We included 257 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from three teaching hospitals in Rhode Island. We extracted data from within the first 24 hours of admission. Variables were excluded if values were missing in >20% of cases, otherwise missing values were imputed. 115 patients with complete data after imputation were used for primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis was done after exclusion of one variable (LDH) in the complete dataset (n=257). Primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and critical illness (mechanical ventilation or death), respectively. RESULTS: Only the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (RO-AUC) of COVID-GRAM (0.775, 95%CI 0.525-0.915) for in-hospital death, and CURB65 for in-hospital death (RO-AUC 0.842, 95%CI 0.674-0.932) or critical illness (RO-AUC=0.766, 95%CI 0.584-0.884) were significantly better than random.

Design: Synthetic control analysis comparing hospital admissions for small areas in the intervention population to a group of control areas weighted to be similar in terms of prior COVID-19 hospital admission rates and socio-demographic factors. Intervention: COVID-SMART (Systematic Meaningful Asymptomatic Repeated Testing), a national pilot of large-scale, voluntary rapid antigen testing for people without symptoms of COVID-19 living or working in the City of Liverpool, deployed with the assistance of the British Army from the 6th November 2020 in an unvaccinated population. This pilot informed the UK roll-out of SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid testing, and similar policies internationally. Main outcome measure: Weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions for neighbourhoods in England. Results: The intensive introduction of COVID-SMART community testing was associated with a 43% (95% confidence interval: 29% to 57%) reduction in COVID-19 hospital admissions in Liverpool compared to control areas for the initial period of intensive testing with military assistance in national lockdown from 6th November to 3rd December 2020. A 25% (11% to 35%) reduction was estimated across the overall intervention period (6th November 2020 to 2nd January 2021), involving fewer testing centres, before England's national roll-out of community testing, after adjusting for regional differences in Tiers of COVID-19 restrictions from 3rd December 2020 to 2nd January 2021.

In this paper, we analyze the emergence and large-scale expansion of a community-based environmental protection system (the Voluntary Environmental Agents Program - VEA Program) in the Brazilian Amazon and identify factors that have determined its success since its inception, 25 years ago. Collective actions to protect the environment in the region have been undertaken by local people for at least 40 years, before their legal regulation in 2001 by the federal government of Brazil, and by the Amazonas state in 2007. The system is based on territorial surveillance and monitoring, and on guidelines for the better use of the territory and its natural resources. Between 1995 and 2020, the VEA Program expanded into the two protected areas where it was first implemented reaching approximately 9 thousand km2 of area protected by the system. The number of people participating also grew in this period by around 2050%, as did the participation of women, which grew by 5600%. The system was replicated in 37 protected areas in central Amazonia, and currently covers almost 200 thousand km2 of Amazon rainforest. From our analyses we unveil four main factors that may have allowed the VEA Program to expand and flourish: (a) the communities' previous demand for an effective control system, (b) its legal formalization and regulation, (c) the support from external institutions, and (d) the consolidation of community-based management programs to fund actions. These factors shall be further investigated as to confirm their critical role in the success of the VEA Program. We demonstrate that this community-based environmental protection system has established itself as a legitimate form of social control, and as a mechanism of socio-environmental governance in the areas in which it operates. By allowing more effective protection of territories, it generates consensus amongst users for the adequate management of natural resources, especially in contexts where government's actions are absent or inefficient. We claim that this system can be replicated in various parts of the world.","output":"Community-based environmental protection in the Brazilian Amazon: Recent history, legal landmarks and expansion across protected areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Team-based learning (TBL) currently relies on single best answer questions (SBAQs) to provide immediate feedback. Very short answer questions (VSAQs) are a reliable and discriminatory alternative that encourage learners to use more authentic clinical reasoning strategies compared to SBAQs. However, the challenge of marking VSAQs has limited their integration into TBL; we therefore explored the feasibility of VSAQs within a TBL session. METHODS An online platform was developed to allow immediate marking of VSAQs during the TBL sessions. As part of the readiness assurance process, students completed VSAQs and SBAQs, which were marked in real time. RESULTS Instructors were able to mark all VSAQs during the individual readiness assurance test (iRAT), which facilitated the provision of immediate feedback during the team readiness assurance test (tRAT). The mean time to mark five VSAQs was 422 seconds (SD 73 seconds). For VSAQs, the number of attempts to reach the correct answer ranged from 1 to 38, compared to 1 to 4 for SBAQs. In total, 71.6% of students agreed that using VSAQs in TBL helped to emphasise group discussions. DISCUSSION The wide range of attempts at, and students' perspectives of VSAQs are suggestive of their positive impact on student discussion during TBL.

For the variant VOC 202012/01 (also referred to as B.1.1.7), however, preliminary reports indicate it may be more transmissible. Here we use a simulation model calibrated to the inherent random fluctuating transmission pattern of COVID-19 to investigate what the probability may be for detecting more transmissible virus variants post facto. We find that post facto identification of successful virus variants of SARS-COV-2 are likely to exhibit growth rates that are substantially larger than the average growth rate.

Results: respiratory samples from 991 individuals were collected, and 62 were positive by PCR. Inconclusive PCR results were observed in 19 samples and were excluded. The median age of participants was 40.2 years (IQR 32.3C47.8), and 932 (94%) were males. Most (77.4%) of infections were asymptomatic. The sensitivity and the specificity of the LIAISON assay were 43.3% (95%CI 30.6C56.8) and 99.9% (95%CI 99.3C100). The Standard Q assay had lower sensitivity (30.6%, 95%CI 19.6C43.7) but similar specificity (98.8%, 95%CI, 97.8C99.4). Similarly, the LIAISON assay had higher positive predictive value (96.3%, 95%CI 81C99.9% vs. 63.3%, 95%CI, 43.9C80.1%). Both assays performed better in symptomatic patients and among samples with a low-cycle threshold (Ct < 25). Conclusion: In our setting of random community surveillance, rapid antigen testing of nasopharyngeal swabs by either LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag (DiaSorin) or Standard Q COVID-19 Ag (SD Biosensor) was less sensitive to detecting SARS-CoV-2 than the TaqPath COVID-19 RT-PCR.","output":"The Performance of Two Rapid Antigen Tests During Population-Level Screening for SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid exaggeration of host and pathogen traits via arms race dynamics is one possible outcome of host-pathogen coevolution. However, the exaggerated traits are expected to incur costs in terms of resource investment in other life-history traits. The current study investigated the costs associated with evolved traits in a host-pathogen coevolution system. We used the Drosophila melanogaster (host)-Pseudomonas entomophila (pathogen) system to experimentally derive two selection regimes, one where the host and pathogen both coevolved, and the other, where only the host evolved against a non-evolving pathogen. After 17 generations of selection, we found that hosts from both selected populations had better post-infection survivorship than controls. Even though the coevolving populations tended to have better survivorship post-infection, we found no clear evidence that the two selection regimes were significantly different from each other. There was weak evidence for the coevolving pathogens being more virulent than the ancestral pathogen. We found no major cost of increased post-infection survivorship. The costs were not different between the coevolving hosts and the hosts evolving against a non-evolving pathogen. We found no evolved costs in the coevolving pathogens.

Particularly for such challenging situations the handling of an SAD requires sufficient training. We hypothesized that the feasibility of manikin-based airway management with second generation SADs depends on the type of manikin. Methods Two airway manikins (TruCorp AirSim? and Laerdal Resusci Anne? Airway Trainer?) were evaluated by 80 experienced anesthesia providers using 5 different second generation SADs (LMA? Supreme? [LMA], Ambu? AuraGain?, i-gel?, KOO?-SGA and LTS-D?). The primary outcome of the study was feasibility of ventilation measured by assessment of the manikins' lung distention. As secondary outcome measures, oropharyngeal leakage pressure (OLP), ease of gastric tube insertion the insertion time, position and subjective assessments were evaluated. Results Ventilation was feasible with all combinations of SAD and manikin. By contrast, an OLP exceeding 10 cm H2O could be reached with most of the SADs in the TruCorp but with the LTS-D only in the Laerdal manikin. Gastric tube insertion was successful in above 90% in the Laerdal vs 87% in the TruCorp manikin (P<0.009). Insertion times differed significantly between manikins. The SAD positions were better in the Laerdal manikin for LMA, Ambu, i-gel and LTS-D. Participant's assessments were superior in the Laerdal manikin for LMA, Ambu, i-gel and KOO-SGA. Conclusions Ventilation is possible with all combinations. However, manikins are variable in their ability to adequately represent additional functions of second generation SADs.

The authors conducted a web-based cross-sectional study using Google search engine to identify vendor websites selling fish antibiotics in the United States. Vendor websites were included if product information, consumer reviews, and comments were publicly available. Nine fish antibiotics were chosen due to their possibility of having consequences to human misuse. The cost and availability of fish antibiotics was recorded. The proportion of reviews and comments related to human consumption was calculated. Consumer review traffic based on likes and dislikes received was compared between human- and non-human consumption-related reviews. Selected fish antibiotics were purchased and evaluated for physical appearance and compared to FDA-approved available equivalents. We found 24 website vendors with online ordering available for OTC fish antibiotics. Cost varied significantly by antibiotic and quantity ranging from USD $8.99 to $119.99. There were 2,288 reviews documented for the 9 selected antibiotics being sold. Among consumer reviews, 2.4% were potentially associated with human consumption. Human consumption-related reviews constituted 30.2% of all likes received and 37.5% of all dislikes received. Human consumption-related reviews received an average of 9.2 likes compared to 0.52 likes for non-human consumption-related reviews.

METHODS: A total of 212 participants with Acute Febrile Illness were tested for Covid-19 and dengue at the secondary care hospital, Civil Hospital Narwana, Haryana, India. The Covid-19 and dengue diagnosis were performed using standard tests followed by hematological profiling which included neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet count, Vitamin D3 assessment, SGOT, SGPT, and SPO2 concentration levels. RESULTS: Out of 212 participants, 118 were diagnosed with Covid-19 positive only, 18 dengue positive only, 5 co-infected with Covid-19 and dengue, and 71 persons with Acute Febrile Illness (control group). ANOVA revealed that mean SPO2 was significantly lower in Covid-19 and dengue than control, while SGPT and SGOT levels of Covid-19 and dengue patients were significantly higher than the control group.

However, current bioaerosol sampling approaches have reported low detection yields in sputum-positive TB cases. To increase the utility of bioaerosol sampling, we present advances in bioaerosol collection and Mtb identification that improve detection yields. Methods: A previously described Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC) protocol, or 'RASC-1', was modified to incorporate liquid collection of bioaerosol using a high-flow wet-walled cyclone (RASC-2). Individuals with GeneXpert-positive pulmonary TB were sampled pre-treatment over 60-minutes. Putative Mtb bacilli were detected in collected fluid by fluorescence microscopy utilising DMN-Trehalose. Exhaled air and bioaerosol volumes were estimated using continuous CO2 monitoring and airborne particle counting, respectively. Mtb capture was calculated per exhaled air volume sampled and bioaerosol volume for RASC-1 (n=35) and for RASC-2 (n=21). Empty chamber samples were collected between patients as controls. Results: The optimised RASC-2 protocol sampled a median of 258.4L (IQR: 226.9-273.6) of exhaled air per patient compared with 27.5L (IQR: 23.6-30.3) for RASC-1 (p<0.0001). Bioaerosol volume collection was estimated at 2.3nL (IQR: 1.1-3.6) for RASC-2 compared with 0.08nL (IQR: 0.05-0.10) for RASC-1 (p<0.0001). The detection yield of viable Mtb improved from 43% (median 2 CFU, range: 1-14) to 95% (median 20.5 DMN-Trehalose positive bacilli, range: 2-155). These improvements represent a lowering of the limit of detection in the RASC-2 platform to 0.9 Mtb bacilli per 100L of exhaled air from 3.3 Mtb bacilli per 100L (RASC-1). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that technical improvements in particle collection together with sensitive detection enable rapid quantitation of viable Mtb in bioaerosols of sputum positive TB cases. Increased sampling sensitivity may allow future TB transmission studies to be extended to sputum-negative and subclinical individuals, and suggests the potential utility of bioaerosol measurement for rapid intervention in other airborne infectious diseases.","output":"Sensitivity Optimisation of Tuberculosis Bioaerosol Sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The purpose was to evaluate central pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with Covid-19.

METHODS From 1 March until 31 May 2020, all in-hospital patients with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2-RNA and PE diagnosed with computed tomography pulmonary angiography were identified through diagnostic codes in medical charts. PE was characterised as central/peripheral and unilateral/bilateral. Covid-19 related lung changes were evaluated scoring the proportion of affected lung (max-score score 25) for all five lobes in both lungs. ICU and non-ICU patients were included and anticoagulant regimens were assessed. RESULTS Of 1162 patients with Covid-19, 41 were diagnosed with PE (cumulative incidence 3.5%), and of these 63.4% (=overall 2.2%) had central PE. PE on admission was present in 46.3%. No differences were seen in the distribution of central vs. peripheral PE in relation to prophylactic anticoagulation (p=.317). Of ICU patients 82.4% were diagnosed with central PE compared to 50.0% among non-ICU patients (p=.05).

Nuclear import factors function as key gatekeepers that regulate the transport of innate immune regulatory cargo to the nucleus of cells to activate the antiviral response. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model, we demonstrate that SARS-COV ORF6 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi membrane in infected cells, where it binds to and disrupts nuclear import complex formation by tethering karyopherin alpha 2 and karyopherin beta 1 to the membrane. Retention of import factors at the ER/Golgi membrane leads to a loss of STAT1 transport into the nucleus in response to interferon signaling, thus blocking the expression of STAT1-activated genes that establish an antiviral state. We mapped the region of ORF6, which binds karyopherin alpha 2, to the C terminus of ORF6 and show that mutations in the C terminus no longer bind karyopherin alpha 2 or block the nuclear import of STAT1. We also show that N-terminal deletions of karyopherin alpha 2 that no longer bind to karyopherin beta 1 still retain ORF6 binding activity but no longer block STAT1 nuclear import. Recombinant SARS-CoV lacking ORF6 did not tether karyopherin alpha 2 to the ER/Golgi membrane and allowed the import of the STAT1 complex into the nucleus.

In this study, we used our newly developed anti-human resistin (hResistin) antibody to immunohistochemically detect the expression, localization, and intracellular/extracellular compartmentalization of hResistin in a full human tissue panel from healthy individuals.

Seven of these fetuses underwent surgery for tracheal balloon insertion at 118-120 days gestational age (GA) under 1.5-2.0% isoflurane for 2-3 h. Two weeks afterward, at balloon retrieval, a repeat anesthetic: 1.5-2% isoflurane for 6 h was administered. Five of these fetuses were also exposed to dexmedetomidine concurrently. Immunohistochemistry of fetal brains for apoptotic neurons using activated caspase-3 antibodies was compared to that of an unexposed control group at GA 109 and 122 days. RESULTS Neuroapoptosis was detected in the ovine fetus with GA- dependent variation observed in the hippocampus. Increased neuroapoptosis occurred in the isoflurane-only group. Fetuses with isoflurane-dexmedetomidine exposure exhibited decreased neuroapoptosis compared to isoflurane-only group.

We study whether COVID-19 and the public health response to it affected CAN-related pediatric emergency department (ED) visits in the southeastern United States (US). METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on medical records of ED visits from a level I pediatric hospital system serving one of the largest metropolitan areas in the southeastern US from January through June 2018C2020. We used multivariate Poisson regression and linear regression to compare professionally identified CAN-related ED visits before and after a COVID-19 public health emergency declaration in 2020, relative to trends over the same period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Although the number of both overall pediatric ED visits and CAN-related ED visits declined, the number of CAN-related ED visits due to neglect from inadequate adult supervision increased by 62 % (p < 0.01). The number of CAN visits per 1,000 pediatric ED visits also increased by 97 % (p < 0.01). Finally, the proportion of CAN-related ED visits due to neglect from inadequate supervision increased by 100 % (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be aware that patients who present with injuries during a pandemic may be victims of neglect due to changes in social structures in their households. In particular, maltreatment presenting to the ED shifted toward treating injuries and abuse resulting from inadequate supervision.

However, the indirect effects of Covid-19 on pregnancy outcomes remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to compare pregnancy outcomes before and after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Iran. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 2,503 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies, admitted to the maternity department of a womens hospital in Tehran, Iran, during the pre-Covid-19 pandemic (February 19 to April 19, 2019) and the intra-Covid- 19 pandemic (February 19 to April 19, 2020) period. RESULTS: We included 2,503 women admitted to the hospital; 1,287 (51.4 %) were admitted before the Covid-19 lockdown and 1,216 (48.6 %) during the Covid-19 lockdown. There were no significant differences in stillbirth rates (p = 0.584) or pregnancy complications (including preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes) (p = 0.115) between pregnant women in the pre- and intra-pandemic periods. However, decreases in preterm births (p = 0.001), and low birth weight (p = 0.005) were observed in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period. No significant difference in the mode of delivery, and no maternal deaths were observed during the two time periods. CONCLUSIONS: In our study we observed a decrease in preterm births and low birth weight, no change in stillbirths, and a rise in the admission rates of mothers to the ICU during the initial Covid-19 lockdown period compared to pre-Covid-19 lockdown period.

Inappropriate complement activation underlies the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases. Complement component 5 (C5) is a validated therapeutic target for complement-mediated diseases, but the development of new therapeutics has been limited by a paucity of preclinical models to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of candidate therapies. The present report describes a novel humanized C5 mouse and its utility in evaluating a panel of fully human anti-C5 antibodies. Surprisingly, humanized C5 mice revealed marked differences in clearance rates amongst a panel of anti-C5 antibodies. One antibody, pozelimab (REGN3918), bound C5 and C5 variants with high affinity and potently blocked complement-mediated hemolysis in vitro. In studies conducted in both humanized C5 mice and cynomolgus monkeys, pozelimab demonstrated prolonged PK and durable suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo. In humanized C5 mice, a switch in dosing from in-house eculizumab to pozelimab was associated with normalization of serum C5 concentrations, sustained suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo, and no overt toxicity. Our findings demonstrate the value of humanized C5 mice in identifying new therapeutic candidates and treatment options for complement-mediated diseases.","output":"Inhibition of complement pathway activation with Pozelimab, a fully human antibody to complement component C5"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In June 2021, United Nations (UN) Member States committed to ambitious targets for scaling up community-led responses by 2025 toward meeting the goals of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. These targets build on UN Member States 2016 commitments to ensure that 30% of HIV testing and treatment programmes are community-led by 2030. At its current pace, the world is not likely to meet these nor other global HIV targets, as evidenced by current epidemiologic trends. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further slow momentum made to date. The purpose of this paper is to review available evidence on the comparative advantages of community-led HIV responses that can better inform policy making towards getting the world back on track. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to gather available evidence on peer- and community-led HIV responses. Using UNAIDS definition of community-led and following PRISMA guidelines, we searched peer-reviewed literature published from January 1982 through September 2020. We limited our search to articles reporting findings from randomized controlled trials as well as from quasi-experimental, prospective, pre/post-test evaluation, and cross-sectional study designs. The overall goals of this scoping review were to gather available evidence on community-led responses and their impact on HIV outcomes, and to identify key concepts that can be used to quickly inform policy, practice, and research. FINDINGS: Our initial search yielded 279 records. After screening for relevance and conducting cross-validation, 48 articles were selected. Most studies took place in the global south (n = 27) and a third (n = 17) involved youth. Sixty-five percent of articles (n = 31) described the comparative advantage of peer- and community-led direct services, e.g., prevention and education (n = 23) testing, care, and treatment programs (n = 8). We identified more than 40 beneficial outcomes linked to a range of peer- and community-led HIV activities. They include improved HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy, risk behaviours, risk appraisals, health literacy, adherence, and viral suppression. Ten studies reported improvements in HIV service access, quality, linkage, utilization, and retention resulting from peer- or community-led programs or initiatives. Three studies reported structural level changes, including positive influences on clinic wait times, treatment stockouts, service coverage, and exclusionary practices. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Findings from our scoping review underscore the comparative advantage of peer- and community-led HIV responses. Specifically, the evidence from the published literature leads us to recommend, where possible, that prevention programs, especially those intended for people living with and disproportionately affected by HIV, be peer- and community-led. In addition, treatment services should strive to integrate specific peer- and community-led components informed by differentiated care models. Future research is needed and should focus on generating additional quantitative evidence on cost effectiveness and on the synergistic effects of bundling two or more peer- and community-led interventions.","output":"Peer- and community-led responses to HIV: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measles (rubeola) is a highly contagious airborne disease that was declared eliminated in the U.S. in the year 2000.

BACKGROUND: Whilst policy is recognised as an important component in determining the effectiveness of EOLC, there is scant literature which attempts to interrogate how this happens or to hypothesise the mechanisms linking policy to better outcomes. METHOD: This article reports on the second phase of a realist evaluation comprising three case studies of clinical commissioning groups, including 98 in-depth interviews with stakeholders, meeting observation and documentary analysis. FINDINGS: This study reveals the key contextual factors which need to be in place at micro, meso and macro levels if good quality EOLC for older people is to be achieved. The findings provide insight into rising local inequalities and reveal areas of dissonance between stakeholder priorities. Whilst patients privilege the importance of receiving care and compassion in familiar surroundings at EOL, there remains a clear tension between this and the medical drive to cure disease and extend life. The apparent devaluing of social care and subsequent lack of resource has impacted significantly on the way in which dying is experienced. Patient experience at EOL, shaped by the care received both formally and informally, is driven by a fragmented health and social care system. Whilst the importance of system integration appears to have been recognised, significant challenges remain in terms of shaping policy to adequately reflect this. This study highlights the priority attached by patients and their families to the social and relational aspect of death and dying and shines a light on the stark disparities between the health and social care systems which became even more evident at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"How does English national end-of-life care policy impact on the experience of older people at the end of life?

METHODS: This prospective study included 204 patients from a single tertiary-care hospital, hospitalized with COVID-19, of whom 102 were treated with CP administration and standard care (PG) and 102 others who received standard care only (CG). The CG was selected from 336 hospitalized patients using the propensity-score matching (PSM) technique using age, MEWS score, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was mortality rate; secondary outcomes were the requirement of a ventilator, length of ventilator need, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and length of overall hospital confinement. Additionally, parameters predicting death in COVID-19 patients were identified. RESULTS: Findings confirmed a significantly lower mortality rate in the PG versus the CG (13.7% vs. 34.3 %, p = 0.001) and a significant difference in the cumulative incidence of death between the two groups (p < 0.001). CP treatment was associated with lower risk of death (OR = 0.25 CI95 [0.06; 0.91], p = 0.041). There were no significant differences in ICU stay, ventilator time, and hospitalization time between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly lower mortality rate was observed in the group of patients treated with CP.

By employing a novel bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag approach on annual data from 1985 to 2016, the empirical findings and discussions represent the first contribution to the energy economics literature. The findings of this research confirm that the US interest rate has a significant spillover effect on the use of renewable energy in Turkey through the channels of income and local interest rate. Due to limited foreign exchange reserves, high foreign debt, low international reserves, and devaluation of the local currency, the Turkish economy is highly intertwined with the US economy through international investment and trade. All these factors reinforce the spillover influence of the US interest rate on energy consumption in Turkey. Moreover, this study affirms that the price of oil has a negative impact on renewable energy use through the real income channel. In order for Turkey to realize its investments in renewable energy resources more reliably and sustainably, the study suggests that policymakers should revise the current economic growth model by making it more resilient to external shocks such as the US interest rate, exchange rate, and oil prices.","output":"The impact of the US interest rate and oil prices on renewable energy in Turkey: a bootstrap ARDL approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Susceptible - Infected - Recovered (SIR) model is used in this research to analyze and predict the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Kuwait.

Therefore, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19 infection? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for original studies on chest CT imaging findings in patients with COVID-19. Methodologic quality of studies was evaluated. Pooled prevalence of chest CT imaging findings were calculated with the use of a random effects model in case of between-study heterogeneity (predefined as I2 &#8805;50); otherwise, a fixed effects model was used. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included. The median number of patients with COVID-19 per study was 124 (range, 50-476), comprising a total of 3,466 patients. Median prevalence of symptomatic patients was 99% (range, >76.3%-100%). Twenty-seven of the studies (96%) had a retrospective design. Methodologic quality concerns were present with either risk of or actual referral bias (13 studies), patient spectrum bias (eight studies), disease progression bias (26 studies), observer variability bias (27 studies), and test review bias (14 studies). Pooled prevalence was 10.6% for normal chest CT imaging findings. Pooled prevalences were 90.0% for posterior predilection, 81.0% for ground-glass opacity, 75.8% for bilateral abnormalities, 73.1% for left lower lobe involvement, 72.9% for vascular thickening, and 72.2% for right lower lobe involvement. Pooled prevalences were 5.2% for pleural effusion, 5.1% for lymphadenopathy, 4.1% for airway secretions/tree-in-bud sign, 3.6% for central lesion distribution, 2.7% for pericardial effusion, and 0.7% for cavitation/cystic changes. Pooled prevalences of other CT imaging findings ranged between 10.5% and 63.2%. INTERPRETATION: Studies on chest CT imaging findings in COVID-19 suffer from methodologic quality concerns. More high-quality research is necessary to establish diagnostic CT criteria for COVID-19. Based on the available evidence that requires cautious interpretation, several chest CT imaging findings appear to be suggestive of COVID-19, but normal chest CT imaging findings do not exclude COVID-19, not even in symptomatic patients.","output":"Chest CT Imaging Signature of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: In Pursuit of the Scientific Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) continue to reshape the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consequently, it has been extensively studied for its therapeutic potential in several diseases such as insomnia, cardiovascular, Alzheimer, and certain types of cancers. Recently, it has been used to adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 patients. It is well-known that melatonin is highly hydrophobic, resulting in lower solubility. However, the molecular structure and dynamic behavior of the formation of melatonin in an aqueous solution and at the water-air interface have not yet been clearly explained. This information is necessary for the melatonin formulation in drug delivery systems. The present work focuses on the molecular structure and dynamics of melatonin molecules in the aqueous solution and at the water-air interface based on using a molecular dynamics simulation study. The results showed that most melatonin molecules were aggregated in an aqueous solution while they were formed a self-assembled monolayer with the ordered structure at the water-air interface. The strong interaction of melatonin depends on their functional group which showed a similar trend for both systems and was sequenced as follows: carbonyl O > indole NH > amide NH > methoxy OA, respectively. However, the carbonyl O and the indole NH groups exhibit strong interactions with water molecules at the interface. Consequently, the two preferred orientations of the melatonin head group can be observed at the water-air interface (i.e., one is to turn the head group to the water surface with the tilted angle of ~40-60 and the second one is to turn the head group away from the water surface with the tilted angle of ~130). The longer lifetime of hydrogen bonds formed between melatonin themselves in the bulk water reveals that the stability of melatonin aggregation in an aqueous solution is more stable. Therefore, melatonin has less soluble in an aqueous solution.","output":"Molecular insight on the formation structure and dynamics of melatonin in an aqueous solution and at the Water-Air interface: A molecular dynamics study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) The aim of the study was to explore the lung recruitability, individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and prone position in COVID-19-associated severe ARDS Methods: Twenty patients who met the inclusion criteria were studied retrospectively (PaO(2)/FiO(2) 68 0  10 3 mmHg) The patients were ventilated under volume-controlled mode with tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight The lung recruitability was assessed via the improvement of PaO(2), PaCO(2), and static respiratory system compliance (C(stat)) from low to high PEEP (5-15 cmH(2)O) Patients were considered recruitable if two out of three parameters improved Subsequently, PEEP was titrated according to the best C(stat) The patients were turned to prone position for further 18-20 h Results: For recruitability assessment, average value of PaO(2) was slightly improved at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O (68 0  10 3 vs 69 7  7 9 mmHg, baseline vs PEEP 15 cmH(2)O;p = 0 31) However, both PaCO(2) and C(stat) worsened (PaCO(2): 72 5  7 1 vs 75 1  9 0 mmHg;p &lt; 0 01 C(stat): 17 5  3 5 vs 16 6  3 9 ml/cmH(2)O;p = 0 05) Only four patients (20%) were considered lung recruitable Individually titrated PEEP was higher than the baseline PEEP (8 0  2 1 cmH(2)O vs 5 cmH(2)O, p &lt; 0 001) After 18-20 h of prone positioning, investigated parameters were significantly improved compared to the baseline (PaO(2): 82 4  15 5 mmHg PaCO(2): 67 2  6 4 mmHg C(stat): 20 6  4 4 ml/cmH(2)O All p &lt; 0 001 vs baseline) Conclusions: Lung recruitability was very low in COVID-19-associated severe ARDS Individually titrated PEEP and prone positioning might improve lung mechanics and blood gasses","output":"Lung Recruitment, Individualized PEEP, and Prone Position Ventilation for COVID-19-Associated Severe ARDS: A Single Center Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on a virtual ethnography, we explore how the increase in remote working has created unequal domestic rearrangements of parenting duties with respect to gender relations during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy.

Results: 29 infants were studied, with mean gestational age of 26.7 weeks and birthweight of 956g.Median day of life of PDA diagnosis was 4. Seven infants (24.1%) underwent PDA ligation. There was significant reduction in FTOE before treatment till after last dose of medication or ligation by a mean difference of 7.27% (p < 0.05). Reduction in FTOE was also found between the first dose of medication till after the last dose or ligation. Cerebral SrO2 significantly increased between first dose of medication till last dose of medication by a mean difference of 3.09% (p = 0.034). RrSO2 values were not significantly affected. No correlation between NIRS values and PDA size was found. Conclusion: Significant increase in cerebral SrO2 and reduction in FTOE by NIRS post PDA closure in hemodynamically significant PDAs suggest that PDA closure may reduce cerebral hypoxia burden.","output":"Cerebral perfusion and assessing hemodynamic significance for patent ductus arteriosus using near infrared red spectroscopy in very low birth weight infants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To inform clinical practice and policy, it is essential to understand the lived experience of health and social care policies, including restricted visitation policies towards the end of life. AIM: To explore the views and experiences of Twitter social media users who reported that a relative, friend or acquaintance died of COVID-19 without a family member/friend present. DESIGN: Qualitative content analysis of English-language tweets. DATA SOURCES: Twitter data collected 7-20th April 2020. A bespoke software system harvested selected publicly-available tweets from the Twitter application programming interface. After filtering we hand-screened tweets to include only those referring to a relative, friend or acquaintance who died alone of COVID-19. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: 9328 tweets were hand-screened; 196 were included. Twitter users expressed sadness, despair, hopelessness and anger about their experience and loss. Saying goodbye via video-conferencing technology was viewed ambivalently. Clinicians' presence during a death was little consolation. Anger, frustration and blame were directed at governments' inaction/policies or the public. The sadness of not being able to say goodbye as wished was compounded by lack of social support and disrupted after-death rituals. Users expressed a sense of political neglect/mistreatment alongside calls for action. They also used the platform to reinforce public health messages, express condolences and pay tribute. CONCLUSION: Twitter was used for collective mourning and support and to promote public health messaging. End-of-life care providers should facilitate and optimise contact with loved ones, even when strict visitation policies are necessary, and provide proactive bereavement support.","output":"Sadness, despair and anger when a patient dies alone from COVID-19: A thematic content analysis of Twitter data from bereaved family members and friends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic can be considered the biggest global health problem and also the biggest health challenge of the present times;its repercussions and impacts directly affect the health professionals involved in dealing with it. Doctors are among the health professional categories involved in coping with it and with a high risk of infection and a higher probability of more severe clinical presentations and mortality. The objective of this study was to compare the mortality due to Covid-19 among physicians in Brazil and the general population during the pandemic. A descriptive study was carried out using secondary data related to the number of deaths from Covid-19 in the general population and among doctors in Brazil, from March 2020 to July 2021. The profile of deaths of physicians showed a higher mortality among men, between 60 and 79 years of age. The temporal analysis of the number of physicians who died from Covid-19 in Brazil in the period analyzed shows a higher number of deaths at the beginning of the pandemic, with a peak in May 2020 (N=107) and a fall after vaccination beginning. Regarding the Covid-19 crude deaths rate, it was found that physicians had a lower risk of dying than the general population, even with greater exposure to the virus. Only in the North and Northeast regions these rates were higher than the general population. The findings of the study indicate the need for interventions in the levels of protection offered to professionals, as well as confirming the negative impacts of the unequal distribution of these professionals, pointed out by medical demography studies carried out in Brazil.","output":"Mortality among Brazilian doctors in Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Unsafe pregnancy termination is a major public health concern among reproductive-aged women in many developing countries. This study evaluated the socio-demographic characteristics, as well as residual spatial correlation in pregnancy termination among Bangladeshi women. METHODS Secondary data was obtained from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey for the survey year 2014. Data included 17,863 samples of ever-married women between the ages of 15-49 years, which is a national representative sample in Bangladesh. Bayesian spatial logistic regression was used to assess the associations between socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy termination. We flexibly modeled the non-linear effects of the continuous covariates while accounting for residual spatial correlation at the district level. RESULTS Our findings revealed that about 19% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported ever had a pregnancy terminated. The risk of pregnancy termination was higher among women who had been working, had a higher wealth index, were in a conjugal relationship, had no children, were older and started their cohabitation earlier. Residual spatial patterns revealed the areas at a higher risk of pregnancy termination, including Panchagarh, Habiganj, and Sylhet after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of pregnancy termination remains considerably high in Bangladesh. The study revealed significant associations of women's age at survey time, age at first cohabitation, occupational status, socio-economic status, marital status and the total number of children ever born with reporting having a history of terminated pregnancy among Bangladeshi ever-married women. The identified socio-demographic characteristics and districts at an increased likelihood of pregnancy termination can inform localized intervention and prevention strategies to improve the reproductive healthcare of women in Bangladesh.","output":"Bayesian spatial analysis of socio-demographic factors influencing pregnancy termination and its residual geographic variation among ever-married women of reproductive age in Bangladesh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinomas are salivary tumors that are low-grade malignant and prone to recurrence and metastasis.

Methods: Retrospective reviews and case series were examined to provide an overview of the management of viral infections in the burn patient. Results: The most common viral pathogens in these patients are the herpesviruses, which include herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6. Established viral infections that may complicate patient management include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C, and, more recently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Herpesvirus infections can occur as primary or nosocomial pathogens but clinical manifestations most commonly are re-activation of latent viral infection. Because of the paucity of data in the burn population, much of the evidence for specific treatments is extrapolated from patients with severe immunosuppression or critical illness. Antiviral therapy is employed for the burn patient with herpesvirus infections. This is an area of active study, and further research is needed to better understand the risks, clinical manifestations, and attributable morbidity and mortality of viral infections.

Identifying and isolating infectious individuals by using screening testing is one such a measure that can contribute to reducing spread. Here, we propose a hybrid stochastic model for infectious disease transmission in a university campus with screening testing and its surrounding community. Based on a compartmental modeling strategy, this hybrid stochastic model represents the evolution of the infectious disease and its transmission using continuous-time stochastic dynamics, and it represents the screening testing as discrete stochastic events. We also develop, in a Bayesian framework, the identification of parameters of this hybrid stochastic model, including transmission rates. These parameters were identified from the screening test data for the university population and observed incidence counts for the surrounding community. We implement the exploration of the Bayesian posterior using a machine-learning simulation-based inference approach. The proposed methodology was applied in a retrospective modeling study of a massive COVID-19 screening conducted at the University of Lige in Fall 2020. The emphasis of the paper is on the development of the hybrid stochastic model to assess the impact of screening testing as a measure to reduce spread. The hybrid stochastic model allows various factors to be represented and examined, such as interplay with the surrounding community, variability of the transmission dynamics, the rate of participation in the screening testing, the test sensitivity, the test frequency, the diagnosis delay, and compliance with isolation. The application in the retrospective modeling study suggests that a high rate of participation and a high test frequency are important factors to reduce spread.","output":"A hybrid stochastic model and its Bayesian identification for infectious disease screening in a university campus with application to massive COVID-19 screening at the University of Lige"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected individuals that have hypertension or cardiovascular comorbidities have an elevated risk of serious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease and high rates of mortality but how COVID-$19$ and cardiovascular diseases interact are unclear. We therefore sought to identify novel mechanisms of interaction by identifying genes with altered expression in SARS-CoV-$2$ infection that are relevant to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Some recent research shows the SARS-CoV-$2$ uses the angiotensin converting enzyme-$2$ (ACE-$2$) as a receptor to infect human susceptible cells. The ACE2 gene is expressed in many human tissues, including intestine, testis, kidneys, heart and lungs. ACE2 usually converts Angiotensin I in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to Angiotensin II, which affects blood pressure levels. ACE inhibitors prescribed for cardiovascular disease and hypertension may increase the levels of ACE-$2$, although there are claims that such medications actually reduce lung injury caused by COVID-$19$. We employed bioinformatics and systematic approaches to identify such genetic links, using messenger RNA data peripheral blood cells from COVID-$19$ patients and compared them with blood samples from patients with either chronic heart failure disease or hypertensive diseases. We have also considered the immune response genes with elevated expression in COVID-$19$ to those active in cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to COVID-$19$ and chronic heart failure, and common to COVID-$19$ and hypertension, were identified; the involvement of these common genes in the signalling pathways and ontologies studied. COVID-$19$ does not share a large number of differentially expressed genes with the conditions under consideration. However, those that were identified included genes playing roles in T cell functions, toll-like receptor pathways, cytokines, chemokines, cell stress, type 2 diabetes and gastric cancer. We also identified protein-protein interactions, gene regulatory networks and suggested drug and chemical compound interactions using the differentially expressed genes.

However, in many network contexts, the structure of network connections is unknown, leading to a challenge. We develop and examine the mathematical properties of two distinct informationally light strategies, a novel global strategy and local strategy, that yield higher degree nodes in virtually any network structure. We further identify a novel network property called Inversity, whose sign determines which of the two strategies, local or global, will be most effective for a network. We demonstrate that local and global strategies obtain a several-fold improvement in node degree relative to a random selection benchmark for generated and real networks (including contact, affiliation and online networks). In some networks, they achieve a 100-fold improvement. We show how these new strategies can be used to control contagion of an epidemic spreading across a set of village networks, finding that the strategies developed here require far fewer ($<50\\\\%$) nodes to be immunized, relative to the random strategy baseline. Prior research has typically used the complete network structure to choose nodes for optimal seeding. The relevant network is often costly to collect, and is privacy-invasive, requiring knowing each person's network neighbors, and might not be possible to obtain for time-sensitive interventions. Our interventions are less invasive of individual privacy, since each selected node only needs to nominate some network neighbors for intervention, while mathematically guaranteed to provide better connected nodes.","output":"Interventions with Inversity in Unknown Networks Can Help Regulate Contagion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND LY03004, a novel investigational risperidone long-acting injection (LAI) microsphere formulation, can release risperidone more quickly after injection than Risperdal Consta?. This study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of LY03004 compared with those on Risperdal Consta?. METHODS A total of 100 Chinese patients with stable schizophrenia were randomly assigned to the LY03004 or Risperdal Consta? treatment group. Each patient received five biweekly intramuscular injections of 25 mg risperidone long-acting injection microspheres. A total of 34 blood samples before and after injections from Day 1 to Day 113 were collected from each patient, and polymorphic alleles of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 (*4, *10, *14), CYP3A5 (*3), and ABCB1 (C1236 > T, G2677T/A, and C3435T) were analyzed using Sanger sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS The risperidone Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, AUC0-tau,ss, and the ratio of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-R) in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs) were significantly different compared with those in normal metabolizers (NMs) in both the LY03004 and Risperdal Consta? groups (P < 0.05). However, 9-OH-R was not significantly different between IMs and NMs (P > 0.05). The AUC0-tau,ss of the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-OH-R) was 6.51  3.34 in NMs and 7.00  1.81 in IMs (P = 0.071) in the LY03004 group and 6.07  2.31 and 7.95  3.42 (P = 0.053) in NMs and IMs, respectively, in the Risperdal Consta? group. In the LY03004 group, the Cmax,ss of risperidone in carriers of the ABCB1-C3435T TT variant was significantly lower than that in CC and CT carriers (TT 7.76  4.23 ng/mL, CT 11.6  8.27 ng/ml, CC 14.3  7.66 ng/ml; P = 0.045), but no significant differences were found in the active moiety. In the Risperdal Consta? group, C3435T TT carriers had significantly lower Cmin,ss of the active moiety (TT 5.09  4.38 ng/ml, CT 11.4  8.42 ng/ml, CC 14.3  6.43 ng/ml; P = 0.007). Furthermore, Cmin,ss of the active moiety was significantly different among all ABCB1-G2677T/A genotypes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The pharmacokinetics of risperidone and the ratio of risperidone to 9-OH-R were highly dependent on CYP2D6 activity. However, there was no significant effect in 9-OH-R.

There was effect modification by age and BMI in the association of history of suicide attempt with COVID-19 positivity such that the association was only significant in patients younger than 59 years and in obese (BMI [] 30) patients respectively (adjusted OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.02 - 5.79 and OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.65 - 4.94 respectively). Conclusions: Young or obese suicide attempters with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have higher rates of COVID-19 diagnosis; due to possible long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of infection with SARS-CoV-2, such patients should be monitored closely.","output":"History of suicide attempts and COVID-19 infection in Veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: effect modification by age and obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two different sarbecoviruses have caused major human outbreaks in the last two decades1,2. Both these sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, engage ACE2 via the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)2-6. However, binding to ACE2 orthologs from humans, bats, and other species has been observed only sporadically among the broader diversity of bat sarbecoviruses7-11. Here, we use high-throughput assays12 to trace the evolutionary history of ACE2 binding across a diverse range of sarbecoviruses and ACE2 orthologs. We find that ACE2 binding is an ancestral trait of sarbecovirus RBDs that has subsequently been lost in some clades. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that bat sarbecoviruses from outside Asia can bind ACE2. In addition, ACE2 binding is highly evolvable: for many sarbecovirus RBDs there are single amino-acid mutations that enable binding to new ACE2 orthologs. However, the effects of individual mutations can differ markedly between viruses, as illustrated by the N501Y mutation which enhances human ACE2 binding affinity within several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern12 but severely dampens it for SARS-CoV-1. Our results point to the deep ancestral origin and evolutionary plasticity of ACE2 binding, broadening consideration of the range of sarbecoviruses with spillover potential.","output":"ACE2 binding is an ancestral and evolvable trait of sarbecoviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein ubiquitination regulates important innate immune responses. The discovery of viruses encoding deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) suggests they remove ubiquitin to evade ubiquitin-dependent antiviral responses; however, this has never been conclusively demonstrated in virus-infected cells. Arteriviruses are economically important positive-stranded RNA viruses that encode an ovarian tumor (OTU) domain DUB known as papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). This enzyme is essential for arterivirus replication by cleaving a site within the viral replicase polyproteins and also removes ubiquitin from cellular proteins. To dissect this dual specificity, which relies on a single catalytic site, we determined the crystal structure of equine arteritis virus PLP2 in complex with ubiquitin (1.45 ?). PLP2 binds ubiquitin using a zinc finger that is uniquely integrated into an exceptionally compact OTU-domain fold that represents a new subclass of zinc-dependent OTU DUBs. Notably, the ubiquitin-binding surface is distant from the catalytic site, which allowed us to mutate this surface to significantly reduce DUB activity without affecting polyprotein cleavage. Viruses harboring such mutations exhibited WT replication kinetics, confirming that PLP2-mediated polyprotein cleavage was intact, but the loss of DUB activity strikingly enhanced innate immune signaling. Compared with WT virus infection, IFN- mRNA levels in equine cells infected with PLP2 mutants were increased by nearly an order of magnitude. Our findings not only establish PLP2 DUB activity as a critical factor in arteriviral innate immune evasion, but the selective inactivation of DUB activity also opens unique possibilities for developing improved live attenuated vaccines against arteriviruses and other viruses encoding similar dual-specificity proteases.","output":"Deubiquitinase function of arterivirus papain-like protease 2 suppresses the innate immune response in infected host cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute cycling exercise can modulate motor cortical circuitry in the non-exercised upper-limb. Within the primary motor cortex, measures of intracortical inhibition are reduced and intracortical facilitation is enhanced following acute exercise. Further, acute cycling exercise decreases interhemispheric inhibition between the motor cortices and lowers cerebellar-to-motor cortex inhibition. Yet, investigations into the effects of acute exercise on sensorimotor integration, referring to the transfer of incoming afferent information from the primary somatosensory cortex to motor cortex, are lacking. The current work addresses this gap in knowledge with two experimental sessions. In the first session, we tested the exercise-induced changes in somatosensory and motor excitability by assessing somatosensory (SEP) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs). In the second session, we explored the effects of acute cycling exercise on short- (SAI) and long-latency afferent inhibition (LAI), and afferent facilitation. In both experimental sessions, neurophysiological measures were obtained from the non-exercised upper-limb muscle, tested at two time-points pre-exercise separated by a 25-min period of rest. Next, a 25-minute bout of moderate-intensity lower-limb cycling was performed with measures assessed at two time-points post-exercise. Acute lower-limb cycling increased LAI, without modulation of SAI or afferent facilitation. Further, there were no exercise-induced changes to SEP or MEP amplitudes. Together, these results suggest that acute exercise has unique effects on sensorimotor integration, which are not accompanied by concurrent changes in somatosensory or motor cortical excitability.","output":"The influence of an acute bout of moderate intensity cycling exercise on sensorimotor integration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although extensive research is being done to combat SARS-CoV-2, we are yet far away from a robust conclusion or strategy.

Earlier studies have highlighted the effectiveness of the trauma-focused preventive group intervention Mein Weg (English My Way), and the feasibility of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for UYRs. Both interventions are deemed to be empirically supported treatments (ESTs). However, UYRs seldom receive ESTs or, in fact, any treatment at all. In view of the high need and the limited treatment resources available, a stepped-care approach is indicated but has not been evaluated so far. The purpose of this trial is to compare the stepped-care approach BETTER CARE with usual care enhanced with screening and indication (usual care+). METHODS: In a cluster randomized controlled trial involving N = 540 UYRs living in up to N = 54 child and youth welfare service (CYWS) facilities, BETTER CARE will be compared with usual care+. We will randomize clusters comprising a CYWS facility with at least one eligible psychotherapist. BETTER CARE consists of step (1) screening and indication and either step (2) preventive trauma-focused group intervention Mein Weg delivered by trained CYWS staff or step (3) TF-CBT delivered by trained community therapists and supported by trained translators if necessary. Participants will be assessed 6 and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome is the severity of PTSS after 12 months. Secondary outcomes are depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and proxy reported PTSS. Furthermore, drug use, health costs, benefits, and long-term effects on integration/acculturation will be assessed. DISCUSSION: The trial will directly integrate a stepped-care approach into existing structures of the German child welfare and (mental) health system. It could, therefore, serve as a blueprint for how to implement ESTs for UYRs. If successful, screening, prevention, and intervention will be sustainably implemented in CYWS in southern Germany.

Significant variation for carotenoid (provitamin A, lutein, zeaxanthin) and tocochromanol (vitamin E, antioxidants) levels is present in temperate sweet corn germplasm, yet previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits have been limited by low statistical power and mapping resolution. Here, we employed a high-quality transcriptomic dataset collected from fresh sweet corn kernels to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and transcriptome prediction studies for 39 carotenoid and tocochromanol traits. In agreement with previous GWAS findings, TWAS detected significant associations for four causal genes, -carotene hydroxylase (crtRB1), lycopene epsilon cyclase (lcyE), -tocopherol methyltransferase (vte4), and homogentisate geranylgeranyltransferase (hggt1) on a transcriptome-wide level. Pathway-level analysis revealed additional associations for deoxy-xylulose synthase2 (dxs2), diphosphocytidyl methyl erythritol synthase2 (dmes2), cytidine methyl kinase1 (cmk1), and geranylgeranyl hydrogenase1 (ggh1), of which, dmes2, cmk1, and ggh1 have not previously been identified through maize association studies. Evaluation of prediction models incorporating genome-wide markers and transcriptome-wide abundances revealed a trait-dependent benefit to the inclusion of both genomic and transcriptomic data over solely genomic data, but both transcriptome- and genome-wide datasets outperformed a priori candidate gene-targeted prediction models for most traits. Altogether, this study represents an important step towards understanding the role of regulatory variation in the accumulation of vitamins in fresh sweet corn kernels.

The mathematical rationale underlying the building of the animal health status indicator ranks properties on a 0 - 100% scale in terms of disease positivity in the herd, with the lowest indicator value indicating the highest cumulative disease frequency (0% = all animals tested positive for the three diseases, 100% = all animals tested negative for all diseases). Anti-T. gondii, anti-N. caninum and anti-CAEV antibodies were tested using indirect immunofluorescence reaction (IIFR 16), Neospora agglutination test (NAT 25) and agarose gel immunodiffusion (AGID positive or negative), respectively. The animal health status of the farms ranged from 32.38% to 96.40% according to disease positivity.

The collaboration of the Occupational Health Units of the companies and the Health Authorities has been fundamental in the investigation of COVID-19 outbreaks secondary to international travel of workers on mission. The objective of this study was to describe the process of detection and follow-up of cases in an outbreak of COVID-19 in repatriated workers after a six-month mission in a factory of aircraft components in Poland. METHODS A case series study was conducted. Data on sociodemographic, epidemiological and clinical course variables of the cases were collected by telephone clinical interview. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. RESULTS The outbreak involved 20 workers who shared the workplace and made the repatriation trip together. The outbreak investigation was initiated after detecting that a worker presented symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during the 4 days prior to the return trip, which was later confirmed by PCR. During follow-up, 40% (n=8) of the workers were considered cases confirmed by PCR. Of these, only 62.5% (n=5) presented symptoms. Fifty percent (n=4) had fever, 25% (n=2) had cough, respiratory distress, general malaise, and diarrhea, and 12.5% (n=1) had anosmia, ageusia, and conjunctivitis. All of them underwent home isolation with outpatient telephone follow-up. At the end of the follow-up, all were asymptomatic and returned to work. The mean close contact was 1.85 per case within the group (SD=3.13), with a range of 0-11, occurring primarily during attendance at extra work social events that were limited to members of the workers' own group and/or during the return flight. The health authorities were informed through established channels so that they could proceed with the detection and tracking of close contacts with people outside the group of workers that occurred during the flight and after arrival to Spain.

First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels. The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far. As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis.

AIM: This study aimed to report the status of NIs and to evaluate the Iranian nosocomial infection surveillance system (INISS) in a teaching hospital in the south of Iran. METHODS: This is a comparative historical study on the records of hospital admitted patients from 2018 to 2019. Data on patients who were diagnosed with NI was extracted from the INISS database. The database includes data on the incidence of different types of NIs in each hospital ward, the patients infection outcome, the agents involved, and the site of infection. RESULTS: The results indicated that the rate of NI (cases of NI/ 100 admissions) in the hospital was %2.95. The highest rate of NIs was reported from ICUs. Of the infected patients, 45.61% were female, 98.95% had underlying diseases, and 30.88% died due to nosocomial infections. The median (IQR) of the duration of hospital stay among infected patients was 13 (7C18). The most common site of infection was VAE (ventilator-associated events) (39.40%) and the most common isolated agent, irrespective of the organ involved, was Acinetobacter (spp.) (22.75%). CONCLUSIONS: We reported ICU and Acinetobacter (spp.) as the most affected ward and most common agent involved in recorded NIs respectively. The rate of NI in the study hospital was exceptionally low when compared to its counterparts in a few other developed countries. The INISS needs to be further evaluated with regard to the completeness and representativeness of the surveillance system.

It is unknown whether patients with VLD constitute a high-risk population for complications and greater COVID-19-related mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to assess the prevalence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with VLD, as well as to assess its impact on hepatic decompensation and survival. Methods This is a observational international study analyzing the prevalence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VLD between March 2020CMarch 2021 comparing with the general population (GP). Patients from Spain (5 centers, n = 493) and France (1 center, n = 475) were included. Results Nine hundred and sixty-eight patients were included: 274 PSVD, 539 SVT and 155 BCS. Among them, 138 (14%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2: 53 PSVD, 77 SVT and 8 BCS. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PSVD (19%) and SVT (14%) was significantly higher than in GP (6.5%, p < 0.05), while it was very similar in BCS (5%). In terms of infection severity, patients with VLD also presented a higher need of hospital admission (14% vs 7.3%, p<0.01), ICU admission (2% vs 0.7%, p< 0.01) and mortality (4% vs 1.5%, p < 0.05) than GP. Previous history of ascites (50% vs 8%, p < 0.05) and post-COVID-19 hepatic decompensation (50% vs 4%, p < 0.05) were associated to COVID-19 mortality.

Although evidence suggests that masks help to curb the spread of the disease, there is little empirical research at the population level. We investigate the association between self-reported mask-wearing, physical distancing, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA, along with the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. METHODS: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered via a web platform to randomly surveyed US individuals aged 13 years and older, to query self-reports of face mask-wearing. Survey responses were combined with instantaneous reproductive number (Rt) estimates from two publicly available sources, the outcome of interest. Measures of physical distancing, community demographics, and other potential sources of confounding (from publicly available sources) were also assessed. We fitted multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask-wearing and community transmission control (Rt<1). Additionally, mask-wearing in 12 states was evaluated 2 weeks before and after statewide mandates. FINDINGS: 378a??207 individuals responded to the survey between June 3 and July 27, 2020, of which 4186 were excluded for missing data. We observed an increasing trend in reported mask usage across the USA, although uptake varied by geography. A logistic model controlling for physical distancing, population demographics, and other variables found that a 10% increase in self-reported mask-wearing was associated with an increased odds of transmission control (odds ratio 353, 95% CI 203-643). We found that communities with high reported mask-wearing and physical distancing had the highest predicted probability of transmission control. Segmented regression analysis of reported mask-wearing showed no statistically significant change in the slope after mandates were introduced; however, the upward trend in reported mask-wearing was preserved. INTERPRETATION: The widespread reported use of face masks combined with physical distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Self-reported mask-wearing increased separately from government mask mandates, suggesting that supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximise adoption and help to curb the ongoing epidemic.

This study was conducted to clarify the patient's characteristics whose disease progressed to severe status. METHODS: The medical records of all consecutive 300 Japanese patients hospitalized at our institution between February and November 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics were evaluated to compare between mild (no oxygen needed), moderate (oxygen needs of 1-4 L/min), and severe diseases (oxygen needs of 5 L/min or more). RESULTS: The median age was 68 years old, with 123 (41.0%) males and 177 (59.0%) females. Of these, 199 patients (66.3%), 55 patients (18.3%), 46 patients (15.3%) patients were in the mild disease, moderate disease, severe disease groups, respectively. Patients with severe disease were more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, and tended to have higher body mass index. In laboratory data, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), LDH, and AST on admission were significantly associated with the severity. In multivariate analysis, age and CRP were the independent risk factors for severe disease (OR = 1.050, 1.130, respectively). The optimal cut-off value for age was 74 years old and that for CRP was 3.15 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Age and CRP were independently associated with disease severity of COVID-19 in multivariate analysis. Additionally, the numbers of underlying disease, lymphocyte count, and inflammatory markers such as LDH and D-dimer may also be related to disease severity.","output":"Clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with moderate to severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flexible optoelectronic devices attract considerable attention due to their prominent role in creating novel wearable apparatus for bionics, robotics, health care, and so forth.

With the global spread of COVID-19 throughout the world and the need to have a real-time screening of the population, especially in crowded places, this study aimed to investigate the applicability of sniffer dogs to carry out such a task. METHODS: Firstly, three male and female dogs from German shepherd (Saray), German black (Kuzhi) and Labrador (Marco) breeds had been intensively trained throughout the classical conditioning method for 7 weeks. They were introduced to human specimens obtained from the throat and pharyngeal secretions of participants who were already reported positive or negative for SARS-COV-2 infection be RT-PCR. Each dog underwent the conditioning process for almost 1000 times. In the meantime another similar condition process was conducted on clothes and masks of COVID-19 patient using another three male and female dogs from Labrador (Lexi), Border gypsy (Sami), and Golden retriever (Zhico) breeds. In verification test for the first three dogs, 80 pharyngeal secretion samples consisting of 26 positive and 54 negative samples from different medical centers who underwent RT-PCR test were in a single-blind method. In the second verification test for the other three dogs, masks and clothes of 50 RT-PCR positive and 70 RT-PCR negative cases from different medical center were used. RESULTS: In verification test using pharyngeal secretion, the sniffer dogs' detection capability was associated with a 65% of sensitivity and 89% of specificity and they amanged to identify 17 out of the 26 positive and 48 out of the 54 true negative samples. In the next verification test using patients' face masks and clothes, 43 out of the 50 positive samples were correctly identified by the dogs. Moreover, out of the 70 negative samples, 65 samples were correctly found to be negative. The sensitivity of this test was as high as 86% and its specificity was 92.9%. In addition, the positive and negative predictive values were 89.6 and 90.3%, respectively.

We exploit exhaustive loan-level data from the credit register with unique information on the provision of COVID-19 public loan guarantees in Spain. We find that firms are more likely to obtain a public guaranteed loan from banks to which they have larger pre-COVID credit exposures, measured as the share of the firms total credit outstanding with the bank before the shock. This effect is more pronounced for risky firms and for firms in more pandemic-affected sectors, especially for weaker ex-ante banks, with lower capital and higher nonperforming loans. Effects operate both at the intensive and extensive margin of lending. Moreover, we show that the guarantee scheme results in credit substitution at the firm-bank level, with the share and amount of nonguaranteed (private) credit declining for firms that obtain guaranteed loans, in part reflecting early prepayment of outstanding private credit. Further, banks that grant guaranteed loans are less prone to recognize loan impairment, consistent with the public guarantee acting as a protection against (private) credit risk. Finally, we find that banks that participate more in the public credit guarantee scheme gain market share by increasing their portfolio of loans to existing but also to (less risky) new borrowers. These results show that government guaranteed credit has relevant economic effects on the structure of the banking system by affecting both existing and new borrower-lender relationships.","output":"Public Guarantees, Relationship Lending and Bank Credit: Evidence from the COVID-19 Crisis (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Shoulder range-of-motion (ROM) assessment is vital for the follow-up evaluation of operated patients and for the outcome-based research studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy and reliability of a remote on-screen application (app)-based method of shoulder ROM measurement through a telehealth medium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consultant shoulder surgeon, a board-certified orthopedic resident, and a graduate medical doctor served as the examiners. The cohort consisted of 24 healthy volunteers and 16 symptomatic patients with expected shoulder ROM deficits. Shoulder ROM was first examined physically using a goniometer in the clinic and then over Zoom remote conferencing using the protractor extension app of the Chrome browser. RESULTS: Instrument validity was examined by comparing the goniometer method with the protractor app-based method of the expert shoulder consultant using Bland-Altman analysis. It showed only minor mean differences between the healthy volunteers and the patients in elevation (2.0 and 5.0, respectively), abduction (2.0 and 3.0, respectively), external rotation with the elbow adducted (1.9 and 0.2, respectively), external rotation with the elbow abducted at 90 (0.4 and 4, respectively), and internal rotation with elbow abducted at 90 (2.3 and 1.2, respectively), with limits of agreement that were below the well-established minimal clinically important difference values. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values varied between 0.83 and 0.96 for the volunteers and between 0.90 and 0.98 for the patients, indicating excellent correlation between the 2 methods. The interobserver reliability between 2 examiners for the protractor app-based method as evaluated by ICC scores was excellent; it ranged between 0.86 and 0.98 for the volunteers and between 0.88 and 0.99 for the patients. Comparison of the protractor app-based method with the gold-standard goniometer method for the resident and the graduate doctor showed excellent ICC values. CONCLUSION: A protractor app-based method of measuring shoulder ROM over a telehealth medium is accurate and reliable compared with a clinical goniometer method.

However, individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance. Article summary We performed linkage mapping on a panel of recombinant lines generated between two genetically divergent strains of Caenorhabditis elegans and identified a bleomycin-response QTL. We generated CRISPR-Cas9 deletions and reciprocal allele-replacement strains for all six candidate genes across the QTL confidence interval. Deletions of one gene, H19N07.3, caused increased bleomycin sensitivity in both divergent genetic backgrounds. This gene might act in stress responses and detoxification in nematodes. We further compared our linkage mapping to a genome-wide association mapping and showed that a rare expression variant in the CB4856 strain likely underlies bleomycin-response differences.","output":"A nematode-specific gene underlies bleomycin-response variation in Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term care for older adults is highly affect by the COVID-19 outbreak The objective of this rapid review is to understand what we can learn from previous crises or disasters worldwide to optimize the care for older adults in long term care facilities during the outbreak of COVID-19 We searched five electronic databases to identify potentially relevant articles In total, 23 articles were included in this study Based on the articles, it appeared that nursing homes benefit from preparing for the situation as best as they can For instance, by having proper protocols and clear division of tasks and collaboration within the organization In addition, it is helpful for nursing homes to collaborate closely with other healthcare organizations, general practitioners, informal caregivers and local authorities It is recommended that nursing homes pay attention to capacity and employability of staff and that they support or relieve staff where possible With regard to care for the older adults, it is important that staff tries to find a new daily routine in the care for residents as soon as possible Some practical tips were found on how to communicate with people who have dementia Furthermore, behavior of people with dementia may change during a crisis We found tips for staff how to respond and act upon behavior change After the COVID-19 outbreak, aftercare for staff, residents, and informal caregivers is essential to timely detect psychosocial problems The consideration between, on the one hand, acute safety and risk reduction (e g by closing residential care facilities and isolating residents), and on the other hand, the psychosocial consequences for residents and staff, were discussed in case of other disasters Furthermore, the search of how to provide good (palliative) care and to maintain quality of life for older adults who suffer from COVID-19 is also of concern to nursing home organizations In the included articles, the perspective of older adults, informal caregivers and staff is often lacking Especially the experiences of older adults, informal caregivers, and nursing home staff with the care for older adults in the current situation, are important in formulating lessons about how to act before, during and after the coronacrisis This may further enhance person-centered care, even in times of crisis Therefore, we recommend to study these experiences in future research","output":"[COVID-19 outbreak in nursing homes: what can be learned from the literature about other disasters or crisis situations?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent months, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a worldwide threat with about 4.2 million confirmed cases and almost 300 000 deaths.

The variability in the occurrence of AKI has been attributed to the difference in geographic locations, race/ethnicity, and severity of illness. AKI among hospitalized patients is associated with increased length of stay and in-hospital deaths. Even patients with AKI who survive to hospital discharge are at risk of developing chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease. An improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19 is crucial to mitigate and manage AKI and to improve the survival of patients who developed AKI during COVID-19. The goal of this article is to provide our current understanding of the etiology and the pathophysiology of AKI in the setting of COVID-19.","output":"Pathophysiology and Pathology of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To compare the effects of coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), on pregnant women in Saudi Arabia, and to understand the disease dynamics of these coronaviruses so as to konw how to provide care and management of infected pregnant women and infants. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of all published papers on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnant women in Saudi Arabia to identify knowledge gaps. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on the PRISMA system. The search included all papers which were published between September 1, 2012 and November 29, 2020 on pregnant women with MERS-CoV and/ or COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Of 26 papers screened, five were included in the analysis. Results: A total of 11 pregnant women with MERS-CoV and four with COVID-19 were reported in Saudi Arabia in the medical literature during the review period. The mean ages of the women were 33 and 31 years old for MERS-CoV and COVID-19, respectively. Maternal and fetal mortality in cases of MERS-CoV were 35% and 30%, respectively, while no maternal or fetal mortalities were reported in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Very limited data has emerged from Saudi Arabia on pregnant women MERS-CoV and COVID-19. With such high mortality observed with MERS-CoV compared to COVID-19, there is a need for greater reporting of cases to truly grasp the extent of these infections in pregnant women in a country where both coronaviruses are circulating.","output":"Coronaviruses in pregnant women in Saudi Arabia: A systematic comparative review of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to bring quantum computing to robotics.

Methods: All persons with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result from a combined nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab (first samples from unique persons only) that was collected between March 17, 2020, and March 31, 2021, in Public Health testing facilities in the region Kennemerland, province of North Holland, the Netherlands were included. Data on hospital (and ICU) admission were collected from the two large teaching hospitals in the region Kennemerland. Results: In total, 20,207 SARS-CoV-2 positive persons were included in this study, of whom 310 (1.5%) were hospitalized in a regional hospital within 30 days of their positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. When persons were categorized in three SARS-CoV-2 viral load groups, the high viral load group (Cp < 25) was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization as compared to the low viral load group (Cp > 30) (ORadjusted [95%CI]: 1.57 [1.11-2.26], p-value=0.012), adjusted for age and sex. The same association was seen for ICU admission (ORadjusted [95%CI]: 7.06 [2.15-43.57], p-value=0.007). For a subset of 243 of the 310 hospitalized patients, the association of initial SARS-CoV-2 Cp-value with in-hospital mortality was analyzed. The initial SARS-CoV-2 Cp-value of the 17 patients who deceased in the hospital was significantly lower (indicating a higher viral load) compared to the 226 survivors: median Cp-value [IQR]: 22.7 [3.4] vs. 25.0 [5.2], OR[95%CI]: 0.81 [0.68-0.94], p-value = 0.010. Conclusions: Our data show that higher initial SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality. We believe that our findings emphasize the added value of reporting SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on Cp-values to identify persons who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes such as hospital or ICU admission and who therefore may benefit from more intensive monitoring.","output":"Initial SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with disease severity: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical malpractice litigation in the United States has resulted in the widespread adoption of defensive medicine practices. Orthopaedic surgery is among the specialties most likely to face a malpractice lawsuit, and hip-related surgeries are commonly involved. This study aimed to analyse malpractice litigation as it relates to hip surgery in the United States. The purpose of this study was to seek answers to the following questions: Has there been an increase or a decrease in the number of hip surgery malpractice cases in recent years? What are the most common reasons for a patient to pursue litigation? Which surgical complications are most likely to result in a lawsuit? What trends do we see in terms of outcomes? The Westlaw legal database was queried for all relevant cases from 2008 to 2018. A retrospective review of cases was conducted and descriptive analyses were performed in order to identify factors associated with hip surgery malpractice litigation. A total of 82 cases were analysed. There was a downtrend in the number of cases per year. Total hip arthroplasty (47 cases, 57.3%) was the procedure most often involved. Procedural error was noted as a reason for litigation in 71 (86.6%) cases. Neurological injury (22 cases, 26.8%), malpositioned hardware (15 cases, 18.3%) and leg length discrepancy (8 cases, 9.8%) were the most common complications listed. The majority of cases resulted in a verdict in favour of the defendant orthopaedic surgeon (48 cases, 58.5%). The mean payout for a plaintiff verdict (20 cases, 24.4%) was $1,647,981 (range, $1,852-$7,000,000) and the mean payout for a settlement (13 cases, 15.9%) was $657,823 (range, $49,000-$3,000,000) (p = 0.063). The study concluded that, within the 10-year period, there was a significant downtrend in hip surgery malpractice cases filed per year. Orthopaedic surgeons were found liable in the minority of cases.

Our objective is to characterize the decline of premature NCD mortality in Brazil based on Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study 2019 estimates. METHODS: We used GBD 2019 data to estimate death rates of the four main NCDs - cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. We estimated the unconditional probability of death between ages 30 to 69, as recommended by the World Health Organization, as well as premature crude- and age-standardized death rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost for these conditions. We also estimated trends in suicide (self-harm) death rates. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2019, the age-standardized unconditional probability of premature death declined -1.4%/year (UI: -1.7%;-1.0%) . Age-standardized death rates declined -1.5%/year (UI: -1.9%; -1.2%), and crude death rates -0.6%/year (UI: (-1.0%; -0.2%). Level of development correlated strongly with the rate of decline, with greatest declines occurring in the Southeast, Center West and South regions. Age-standardized mortality from self-harm declined, most notably in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Premature mortality due to the main NCDs has declined from 1990 in Brazil, although at a diminishing rate over time. The unconditional probability of death and the age-standardized mortality rate produced similar estimates of decline for the four main NCDs, and mirror well decline in mortality from all NCDs. Declines, especially more recent ones, fall short of the international goals. Strategic public health actions are needed. The challenge to implement them will be great, considering the political and economic instability currently faced by Brazil.","output":"Premature mortality due to four main non-communicable diseases and suicide in Brazil and its states from 1990 to 2019: A Global Burden of Disease Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsIn the early days of the first global wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential for a post-viral syndrome to manifest following COVID-19 infection was highlighted.It was pointed out that an early intervention applying management techniques used in patients with CFS/ME appeared to help reduce the fatigue related symptoms of Long COVID.Here we present an analysis of a consecutive case series of the first twenty patients data collected. Our aim was to evaluate the potential of this mode of treatment for Long COVID.MethodFace to face treatment sessions with the practitioners occurred once a week, involving effleurage and other manual articulatory techniques.The individuals being treated also undertook a daily self-massage along with gentle mobility exercises and alternating warm and cool gel packs on the upper spine, to encourage a reduction of spinal inflammation and further aid lymph drainage of the brain and spine.Symptom severity was recorded using the self-reported 54-item Profile of Fatigue Related States (PFRS).ResultThe mean age of the men was 41.8 years with a range of 29.1-53.1 years with the corresponding mean age for women being 39.3 years with a range of 28.3-50.4 years.The average time interval between onset of Coronavirus symptoms and start of treatment for Long COVID was just over 20 weeks.

These studies were designed to examine the changes in the function of the bladder that may underlie neurogenic bladder dysfunction using a mouse model of demyelination in the CNS. METHODS: Bladders from 12 week old male C57BL/6J mice with coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (CIE, a chronic, progressive demyelinating disease model of human MS), and age-matched controls, were cut into 5C7 strips and suspended in physiological muscle baths for tension measurement in response to agonists and electric field stimulation (EFS). Experiments were performed on intact and denuded (with mucosa removed) bladder strips. RESULTS: The maximum effect of EFS was not significantly different between CIE and control bladders. Nerve-evoked EFS contractions (tetrodotoxin-sensitive) were blocked by a combination of atropine (cholinergic antagonist) and ,-methylene ATP (an ATP analog that desensitizes purinergic receptors). In response to EFS, the ,-methylene ATP-resistant (cholinergic) component of contraction was significantly reduced, while the atropine-resistant (purinergic) component was significantly increased in CIE bladders. Removal of the mucosa in CIE bladders restored the cholinergic component. Bethanechol (muscarinic receptor agonist) potency was significantly increased in CIE bladders. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a deficit in the nerve-evoked cholinergic component of contraction that is not due to the ability of the smooth muscle to respond to acetylcholine. We conclude that neurodegenerative bladder dysfunction in this model of multiple sclerosis may be due, in part, to pathologic changes in the mucosa that causes suppression of muscarinic receptor-mediated contractile response and augmentation of purinergic response of the underlying muscle. Further studies utilizing CIE mice should help elucidate the pathological changes in the mucosa resulting from demyelination in the CNS.","output":"Alterations in Nerve-Evoked Bladder Contractions in a Coronavirus-Induced Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infections was found in a cargo ship under repair in Zhoushan, China.

METHODS We tried to identify the most difficult differential diagnoses encountered in a tertiary center of pancreatology and to guide the reader as how to reach the correct strategy and diagnosis in these situations. RESULTS We identified eight clinically difficult situations: i) chronic pancreatitis versus intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, ii) serous versus mucinous cystic neoplasms, iii) serous cystic neoplasms versus branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, iv) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms versus acinar cell cystadenoma, v) (pseudo-) solid serous cystic neoplasm versus neuroendocrine tumor, vi) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors versus solid pseudopapillary tumors, vii) cystic forms of a solid tumor, and viii) rare pancreatic or peripancreatic cystic lesions. The work-up should rely on computed tomography scan, pancreatic magnetic resonance imaging, and, only if necessary, endoscopic ultrasound with or without fine needle aspiration.

We expected that distinct clusters would emerge, with securely attached children more likely showing constructive and successful coping strategies than insecurely attached children. Middle-class children (N = 191) aged 7C11 years old from four private elementary schools were asked to talk about a sad event they experienced using open-ended questions from the Sadness Interview. The answers were coded into different categories of sad events and associated coping strategies. Finally, children were assessed on their security attachment using the Security Scale. Cluster analyses identified a four-cluster solution. Children in the Clusters 1 and 2 were characterized by a perceived successful constructive coping strategy while describing minor events (in the first Cluster), and very painful events (in the second). Furthermore, in the third Cluster children overcame sad events using a perceived successful disengagement coping strategy, whereas children in the fourth Cluster are characterized by perceived unresolved sadness. ANCOVA testing showed that children in the first cluster had significantly higher attachment security compared to Clusters 3 and 4, which did not significantly differ from each other.

Procedural and follow-up outcomes were collected prospectively, and compared with 90 propensity-matched patients undergoing contemporaneous catheter ablation (CA). Six (20.0%) patients undergoing VATS ablation experienced 1 major complication (death n = 1, stroke n = 2, conversion to sternotomy n = 3, and phrenic nerve injury n = 2). This was significantly higher than the 1.1% major complication rate (tamponade requiring drainage n = 1) seen with CA (P < 0.001).

The concept that nucleic acid could modulate the activity of target protein as ligand emerged from basic science studies of viruses. Aptamers are short nucleic acid sequences capable of specific, high-affinity molecular binding, which allow for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Compared to traditional antibodies, aptamers have several advantages, including small size, flexible structure, good biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity. In vitro selection method is used to isolate aptamers that are specific for a desired target from a randomized oligonucleotide library. The first aptamer drug, Macugen, was approved by FDA in 2004, which was accompanied by many studies and clinical investigations on various targets and diseases. Despite much promise, most aptamers have failed to meet the requisite safety and efficacy standards in human clinical trials. Amid these setbacks, the emergence of novel technologies and recent advances in aptamer and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) design are fueling hope in this field. The unique properties of aptamer are gaining renewed interest in an era of COVID-19.

The COVID-19 outbreak is unique in its rapid transmission and results in heavy stress for the front-line health care workers (HCWs). The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) of HCWs fighting for the COVID-19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after 1-month stressful suffering. Three hundred seventy-seven HCWs working in different provinces of China participated in the survey between February 1 and 5. The demographic information was collected first. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure PTSSs and sleep quality. Results showed that 1 month after the outbreak, the prevalence of PTSSs was 3.8% in HCWs. Female HCWs were more vulnerable to PTSSs with hazard ratio of 2.136 (95% CI = 1.388-3.286). HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyperarousal symptoms (hazard ratio = 4.026, 95% CI = 1.233-13.140). There was a significant difference of sleep quality between participants with and without PTSSs (z value = 6.014, p < .001) and among different groups with various contact frequencies (chi-square = 7.307, p = .026). Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSSs through sleep quality (coefficient = 1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543-2.998). In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID-19.

According to Attention Restoration Theory (ART), the positive impact of nature on cognition is mainly driven by fascination. Fascinating properties of nature such as water or a winding hiking trail may capture involuntary attention, allowing the directed form of attention to rest and to recover. This claim has been supported by studies relying on eye-tracking measures of attention deployment, comparing exposure to urban and nature settings. Yet, recent studies have shown that promoting higher engagement with a nature setting can improve restorative benefits, hence challenging ARTs view that voluntary attention is resting. Besides, recent evidence published by Szolosi et al. (2014) suggests that voluntary attention may be involved during exposure to high-mystery nature images which they showed as having greater potential for attention restoration. The current study explored how exposure to nature images of different scenic qualities in mystery (and restoration potential) could impact the engagement of attention. To do so, participants were shown nature images characterized by either low or high mystery properties (with allegedly low or high restoration potential, respectively) and were asked to evaluate their fascination and aesthetic levels. Concurrently, an eye tracker collected measures of pupil size, fixations and spontaneous blinks as indices of attentional engagement. Results showed that high-mystery nature images had higher engagement than low-mystery images as supported by the larger pupil dilations, the higher number of fixations and the reduced number of blinks and durations of fixations. Taken together, these results challenge ARTs view that directed attention is merely resting during exposure to restorative nature and offer new hypotheses on potential mechanisms underlying attention restoration.","output":"The Differential Impact of Mystery in Nature on Attention: An Oculometric Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Innovative analyses of cardiovascular (CV) risk markers and health behaviors linked to neighborhood stressors are essential to further elucidate the mechanisms by which adverse neighborhood social conditions lead to poor CV outcomes. We propose to objectively measure physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and neighborhood stress using accelerometers, GPS, and real-time perceived ecological momentary assessment via smartphone apps and to link these to biological measures in a sample of White and African American women in Washington, DC, neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that living in adverse neighborhood social conditions is associated with higher stress-related neural activity among 60 healthy women living in high or low socioeconomic status neighborhoods in Washington, DC. Sub-aim 1 of this study is to test the hypothesis that the association is moderated by objectively measured PA using an accelerometer. A secondary objective is to test the hypothesis that residing in adverse neighborhood social environment conditions is related to differences in vascular function. Sub-aim 2 of this study is to test the hypothesis that the association is moderated by objectively measured PA. The third aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that adverse neighborhood social environment conditions are related to differences in immune system activation. METHODS: The proposed study will be cross-sectional, with a sample of at least 60 women (30 healthy White women and 30 healthy Black women) from Wards 3 and 5 in Washington, DC. A sample of the women (n=30) will be recruited from high-income areas in Ward 3 from census tracts within a 15% of Ward 3s range for median household income. The other participants (n=30) will be recruited from low-income areas in Wards 5 from census tracts within a 15% of Ward 5s range for median household income. Finally, participants from Wards 3 and 5 will be matched based on age, race, and BMI. Participants will wear a GPS unit and accelerometer and report their stress and mood in real time using a smartphone. We will then examine the associations between GPS-derived neighborhood variables, stress-related neural activity measures, and adverse biological markers. RESULTS: The National Institutes of Health Institutional Review Board has approved this study. Recruitment will begin in the summer of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this research could inform the development of multilevel behavioral interventions and policies to better manage environmental factors that promote immune system activation or psychosocial stress while concurrently working to increase PA, thereby influencing CV health.

OBJECTIVE: To measure inequality in COVID-19 mortality jointly by race and ethnicity and educational attainment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data on COVID-19 mortality from the 50 US states and the District of Columbia for the full calendar year 2020. It included all persons in the United States aged 25 years or older and analyzed them in subgroups jointly stratified by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Population-based cumulative mortality rates attributed to COVID-19.F RESULTS: Among 219.1 million adults aged 25 years or older (113.3 million women [51.7%]; mean [SD] age, 51.3 [16.8] years), 376 125 COVID-19 deaths were reported. Age-adjusted cumulative mortality rates per 100 000 ranged from 54.4 (95% CI, 49.8-59.0 per 100 000 population) among Asian women with some college to 699.0 (95% CI, 612.9-785.0 per 100 000 population) among Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander men with a high school degree or less. Racial and ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality rates remained when comparing within educational attainment categories (median rate ratio reduction, 17% [IQR, 0%-25%] for education-stratified estimates vs unstratified, with non-Hispanic White individuals as the reference). If all groups had experienced the same mortality rates as college-educated non-Hispanic White individuals, there would have been 48% fewer COVID-19 deaths among adults aged 25 years or older overall, including 71% fewer deaths among racial and ethnic minority populations and 89% fewer deaths among racial and ethnic minority populations aged 25 to 64 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Public health research and practice should attend to the ways in which populations that share socioeconomic characteristics may still experience racial and ethnic inequity in the distribution of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection fatality rates (eg, housing, occupation, and prior health status). This study suggests that a majority of deaths among racial and ethnic minority populations could have been averted had all groups experienced the same mortality rate as college-educated non-Hispanic White individuals, thus highlighting the importance of eliminating joint racial-socioeconomic health inequities.","output":"Variation in COVID-19 Mortality in the US by Race and Ethnicity and Educational Attainment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunotherapy and vaccines have revolutionized disease treatment and prevention.

Participants in the divided-attention conditions of Experiment 1 completed auditory tone-distractor tasks that required them to discriminate between tones of different pitches (audio-nonspatial) or auditory channels (audio-spatial), while studying items in different locations in a grid (visual-spatial) differing in reward value.

Participants in Experiment 2 studied the same important visual-spatial information while completing demanding color (visual-nonspatial) or pattern (visual-spatial) discrimination tasks during study. While the cross-modal visual-nonspatial task did not influence memory selectivity, the intra-modal visual-spatial secondary task eliminated participants' sensitivity to item value.

However, many of these have been deposited in GenBank without annotations, severely limiting their value to researchers. While maintaining comprehensive genomic databases for a set of virus families at the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center and Viral Bioinformatics C Canada , we found that researchers were unnecessarily spending time annotating viral genomes that were close relatives of already annotated viruses. We have therefore designed and implemented a novel tool, Genome Annotation Transfer Utility (GATU), to transfer annotations from a previously annotated reference genome to a new target genome, thereby greatly reducing this laborious task. RESULTS: GATU transfers annotations from a reference genome to a closely related target genome, while still giving the user final control over which annotations should be included. GATU also detects open reading frames present in the target but not the reference genome and provides the user with a variety of bioinformatics tools to quickly determine if these ORFs should also be included in the annotation. After this process is complete, GATU saves the newly annotated genome as a GenBank, EMBL or XML-format file. The software is coded in Java and runs on a variety of computer platforms. Its user-friendly Graphical User Interface is specifically designed for users trained in the biological sciences. CONCLUSION: GATU greatly simplifies the initial stages of genome annotation by using a closely related genome as a reference. It is not intended to be a gene prediction tool or a \\"complete\\" annotation system, but we have found that it significantly reduces the time required for annotation of genes and mature peptides as well as helping to standardize gene names between related organisms by transferring reference genome annotations to the target genome.

However, the level of physical activity and adherence to exercise programs are low in people with these diseases. Active video games (AVGs) may provide a more engaging alternative to traditional forms of exercise. OBJECTIVE This review examines the effectiveness of game-based interventions on physiological outcome measures, as well as adherence and enjoyment in subjects with chronic respiratory diseases. METHODS A systematic search of the literature was conducted, with full texts and abstracts included where they involved an AVG intervention for participants diagnosed with respiratory conditions. A narrative synthesis of included studies was performed. Additionally, meta-analysis comparing AVGs with traditional exercise was undertaken for 4 outcome measures: mean heart rate (HR) during exercise, peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) during exercise, dyspnea induced by the exercise, and enjoyment of the exercise. RESULTS A total of 13 full-text papers corresponding to 12 studies were included in the review. Interventions predominantly used games released for the Nintendo Wii (8 studies) and Microsoft Xbox Kinect (3 studies). There were 5 studies that examined the acute effects of a single session of AVGs and 7 studies that examined the long-term effects after multiple sessions of AVGs. Trials conducted over more than 1 session varied in duration between 3 and 12 weeks. In these, AVG interventions were associated with either similar or slightly greater improvements in outcomes such as exercise capacity when compared with a traditional exercise control, and they also generally demonstrated improvements over baseline or nonintervention comparators. There were a few studies of unsupervised AVG interventions, but the reported adherence was high and maintained throughout the intervention period. Additionally, AVGs were generally reported to be well liked and considered feasible by participants. For outcome measures measured during a single exercise session, there was no significant difference between an AVG and traditional exercise for HR (mean difference 1.44 beats per minute, 95% CI -14.31 to 17.18), SpO2 (mean difference 1.12 percentage points, 95% CI -1.91 to 4.16), and dyspnea (mean difference 0.43 Borg units, 95% CI -0.79 to 1.66), but AVGs were significantly more enjoyable than traditional exercise (Hedges g standardized mean difference 1.36, 95% CI 0.04-2.68). CONCLUSIONS This review provides evidence that AVG interventions, undertaken for several weeks, can provide similar or greater improvements in exercise capacity and other outcomes as traditional exercise. Within a single session of cardiovascular exercise, an AVG can evoke similar physiological responses as traditional exercise modalities but is more enjoyable to subjects with chronic respiratory diseases. However, there is very limited evidence for adherence and effectiveness in long-term unsupervised trials, which should be the focus of future research.","output":"Active Video Games for Rehabilitation in Respiratory Conditions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a novel event of the twenty-first century.

However, a lack of data from original studies was reported until May 2020. AIM: To identify studies published from May 2020 until January 2021 that quantitatively assessed the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults using validated psychometric tools. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search of original research articles was conducted using specific terms. The screening procedure was conducted stepwise. RESULTS: Among the 18 included studies, cross-sectional online surveys indicated that older adults were less psychologically distressed than younger ones. A longitudinal study revealed that COVID-19 did not have a major impact on loneliness and satisfaction with life. On the contrary, studies comparing pre- with peri-pandemic data revealed that older adults experienced more severe depressive/anxiety/stress symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. Several studies reported though only subclinical symptoms, as well as low loneliness levels during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Research studies suggested that older age may buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health. Despite evidence against generalised perceptions of vulnerability, older adults' ability to adapt to adversity may be uneven, depending on cultural, social, economic and other individual factors. Taken together, the impact, moreover the long-term impact of COVID-19, is expected to vary across countries and older subpopulations, and remains to be evaluated by prospective, longitudinal studies.","output":"A review on the COVID-19-related psychological impact on older adults: vulnerable or not?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teachers working in institutions like to affiliate themselves with their organizations taking into account their efficacy toward jobs along with encouraging students in studies. The main objective of the present study is to identify the teachers self-efficacy on collective self-efficacy, academic psychological capital, and students engagement which consequently affect brand-based equity. The population taken in this study is college students across China, deriving a sample size of 316. The sample has been selected on the basis of the convenience sampling technique. Smart PLS 3.3.5 software has been used in the present study to analyze data for structural equation modeling. The findings of the study had shown that teachers self-efficacy does not have any impact on employee-based brand equity, however, significantly affects collective self-efficacy, academic psychological capital, and student engagement. Further, strong and moderate mediations have also been confirmed in the study for collective self-efficacy, academic psychological capital, student engagement between the relationships between teachers self-efficacy and brand based equity, however, collective self-efficacy and academic psychological capital could not find any mediating significance. The results have identified the significant role of teachers self-efficacy for collective self-efficacy, academic psychological capital, and student engagement. These empirical findings suggest policy implications for the retention of students in colleges across China.","output":"Teachers Self-Efficacy and Employee Brand Based Equity: A Perspective of College Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the growing excitement of the potential benefits of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in medicine, the number of published clinical prediction models that use these approaches has increased. However, there is evidence (albeit limited) that suggests that the reporting of machine learningCspecific aspects in these studies is poor. Further, there are no reviews assessing the reporting quality or broadly accepted reporting guidelines for these aspects. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a systematic review that will assess the reporting quality of machine learningCspecific aspects in studies that use machine learning to develop clinical prediction models. METHODS: We will include studies that use a supervised machine learning algorithm to develop a prediction model for use in clinical practice (ie, for diagnosis or prognosis of a condition or identification of candidates for health care interventions). We will search MEDLINE for studies published in 2019, pseudorandomly sort the records, and screen until we obtain 100 studies that meet our inclusion criteria. We will assess reporting quality with a novel checklist developed in parallel with this review, which includes content derived from existing reporting guidelines, textbooks, and consultations with experts. The checklist will cover 4 key areas where the reporting of machine learning studies is unique: modelling steps (order and data used for each step), model performance (eg, reporting the performance of each model compared), statistical methods (eg, describing the tuning approach), and presentation of models (eg, specifying the predictors that contributed to the final model). RESULTS: We completed data analysis in August 2021 and are writing the manuscript. We expect to submit the results to a peer-reviewed journal in early 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This review will contribute to more standardized and complete reporting in the field by identifying areas where reporting is poor and can be improved.

A dynamic model of COVID-19 is constructed and the parameters are further optimized using trust region method to match the reported cases trend in the US. Next, Lyapunov stability based controllers are designed that prescribe the amount of daily positive tests to be done in order to eradicate the infections in a much shorter time span without any further social restrictions. The results show a dramatic reduction in the number of cases and span of COVID-19 can be obtained doubling the number of daily quarantines.","output":"Stabilizing COVID-19 Infections in US by Feedback Control based Test and Quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human infections caused by Aeromonas spp. are being reported with increased frequency. We examined 1012 unselected stool specimens from 799 children for various pathogens, including Aeromonas spp., to evaluate the clinical associations of Aeromonas spp. in the stools of children in the East End of London. A total of 33 children had positive cultures for Aeromonas spp. These were identified as: Aeromonas hydrophila (16), A. sobria (9), A. caviae (8). Aeromonas spp. were identified by being oxidase positive in character, a property that distinguishes Aeromonas spp. from Enterobacteriaceae. Associated pathogens included Salmonella typhimurium (1), Campylobacter spp. (3), Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (2), and Giardia lamblia (1). Electron microscopic examination of the stool of 13 children revealed viral particles in two, rotavirus (1), and coronavirus-like particles (1). The associated clinical features in the 25 children with only Aeromonas excretion were diarrhea (21), vomiting (10), abdominal pain (9), fever (4), and mild dehydration (2).

METHODS: Fracture cases admitted to our emergency department and consulted to the orthopedic clinic were included in this study two months before pandemic (Group 1) and after the first (Group 2) two months. The number of cases, types of fractures, duration of hospitalization, waiting times for surgery and post-surgery discharge times were compared between the two groups. Approach to fracture, operating room usage and equipment selection were compiled after the pandemic. The number of cases with COVID-19 positive infection detected by PCR was recorded. Data were compared. RESULTS: The number of patients included in our study was 388. Patients were divided as Group 1 for two months before Pandemic and Group 2 for two months after. 292 (75.3%) patients were included in Group 1 and 96 (24.7%) patients were included in Group 2. Of the patients being operated, 102 (75%) were Group 1, 34 (25%) were Group 2. The duration of hospitalization was 9.544.28 days in Group 1 and 7.823.64 days in Group 2. The waiting time for surgery was 7.283.79 days in Group 1 and 7.234.37 days in Group 2. The discharge times were 3.021.75 days in Group 1 and 2.621.54 days in Group 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in all evaluated parameters (p=0.14), (p=0.97) (p=0.42). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our approach to fracture cases should be applied more rationally, optimally and rapidly within the principles of orthopedics. We must strictly follow the precautions to protect against COVID-19 infection.Alternate abstract: G&Iacute;R&Iacute;? ve AMA?: Hastanemizde COVID-19 pandemisinden ?nceki ve sonraki 2 ay i?indeki vakalar? kar??la?t?rarak artan COVID-19 tan?lar? ile ortopedik k?r??a multidisipliner yakla??m?m?z? bildirmek.

This phenomenon is not surprising since both the innate immunity and the hemostatic systems are two ancestral mechanisms which closely cooperate favoring host's defense against foreign invaders. However, the excessive response of these systems may be dangerous for the host itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched and retrieved the articles, using the following electronic database: MedLine and Embase. We limited our search to articles published in English, but no restrictions in terms of article type, publication year, and geography were adopted. RESULTS The hemostatic phenotype of the infectious diseases is variable depending on the points of attack of the different involved pathogens. Infectious diseases which show a prothrombotic phenotype are bacterial sepsis, SARS-CoV-2 and malaria. However, among the bacterial sepsis, Yersinia Pestis is characterized by a profibrinolytic behavior. On the contrary, the hemorrhagic fevers, due to Dengue and Ebola virus, mainly exploit the activation of fibrinolysis secondary to a huge endothelial damage which can release a large amount of t-PA in the early phase of the diseases. CONCLUSIONS Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis are greatly activated based on the strategy of the different infectious agents which exploit the excess of response of both systems to achieve the greatest possible virulence.","output":"Infectious agents including COVID-19 and the involvement of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.
