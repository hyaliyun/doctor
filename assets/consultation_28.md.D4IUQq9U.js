Methods: Blood from COVID-19 recovered individuals (5 months after infection) and negative subjects was stimulated for 24 hours with HLA predicted peptide megapools of the Spike and Nucleoprotein, or the mixture of them. After stimulation, cytokines were quantified using a beads-based multiplex assay. Results: Interleukin-2 and IFN-{gamma} were found to be specific biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 cellular response. Using the Spike and Nucleoprotein mixture, 91.3% of COVID-19 recovered individuals presented an IL-2 stimulation index over the cut-off, while 82.6% showed IFN-{gamma}. All the negative individuals presented an IL-2 response under the cut-off, while 5.3% of these subjects presented positive IFN-{gamma} stimulation indexes. Moreover, IL-2 production correlated with IgG levels for Spike 1, RBD, and Nucleocapsid.

Conjugating the peptide to an inert chemical moiety is a strategy that has repeatedly proven to be successful in extending the half-life of some therapeutics. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the available literature and assess it in an unbiased manner to determine which conjugates, both biological and synthetic, provide the greatest increase in therapeutic peptide half-life. Systematic searches run on PubMed, Scopus and SciFinder databases resulted in 845 studies pertaining to the topic, 16 of these were included in this review after assessment against pre-specified inclusion criteria registered on PROSPERO (#CRD42020222579). The most common reasons for exclusion were non-IV administration and large peptide size. Of the 16 studies that were included, a diverse suite of conjugates that increased half-life from 0.1 h to 33.57 h was identified. Amongst these peptides, the largest increase in half-life was seen when conjugated with glycosaminoglycans. A meta-analysis of studies that contained fatty acid conjugates indicated that acylation contributed to a statistically significant extension of half-life. Additionally, another meta-analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis suggested that conjugation with specifically engineered recombinant peptides might contribute to a more efficient extension of peptide half-life as compared to PEGylation. Moreover, we confirmed that while polyethylene glycol is a good synthetic conjugate, its chain length likely has an impact on its effectiveness in extending half-life. Furthermore, we found that most animal studies do not include as much detail when reporting findings as compared to human studies.

Our results suggest that thermodynamic predictions for secondary structure stability of solution-phase MB can guide probe design for nanowire-based assays. Dengue virus-specific probes with predicted solution-phase DeltaG of folding in 500 mM buffered NaCl of approximately -4 kcal/mol performed better than those with DeltaG > -2 or < -6 kcal/mol.

Across the United States, Latinx and Indigenous populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 cases and death rates. An examination of the perceptions and beliefs about the spread of the virus, COVID-19 testing, and vaccination amongst racial-ethnic minority groups, specifically Latinx and Indigenous Latin American immigrant communities, is needed to alleviate the widespread disparity in new cases and deaths. METHODS: This study was carried out from August 2020 to January 2021 and used community-based participatory research to engage community partners and build the capacity of community health workers (i.e., promotores de salud) and pre-medical and medical students in conducting qualitative research. The objective of the study was to examine the structural and social determinants of health on perceptions of the coronavirus, its spread, and decisions around COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Data collection included ethnography involving observations in public settings and focus groups with members of Latinx and Indigenous Mexican farm-working communities in the Eastern Coachella Valley, located in the Inland Southern California desert region. A total of seven focus groups, six in Spanish and one in Purpecha, with a total of 55 participants were conducted. Topics covered include perceptions of the coronavirus and its spread, as well as COVID-19 testing and vaccination. RESULTS: Using theme identification techniques, the findings identify structural and social factors that underly perceptions held by Latinx and Indigenous Mexican immigrants about the virus and COVID-19, which, in turn, shape attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Common themes that emerged across focus groups include misinformation, lack of trust in institutions, and insecurity around employment and residency. CONCLUSIONS: This immigrant population is structurally vulnerable to historical and present-day inequalities that put them at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, morbidity, and mortality. Study findings indicate a significant need for interventions that decrease structural vulnerabilities by addressing issues of (dis)trust in government and public health among this population.","output":"Perceptions of the Coronavirus and COVID-19 testing and vaccination in Latinx and Indigenous Mexican immigrant communities in the Eastern Coachella Valley"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: (1) To demonstrate how a risk assessment tool modified to account for the COVID-19 virus during the current global pandemic is able to provide risk assessment for low-energy geriatric hip fracture patients. (2) To provide a treatment algorithm for care of COVID-19 positive/suspected hip fractures patients that accounts for their increased risk of morbidity and mortality. SETTING: One academic medical center including 4 Level 1 trauma centers, 1 university-based tertiary care referral hospital, and 1 orthopaedic specialty hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One thousand two hundred seventy-eight patients treated for hip fractures between October 2014 and April 2020, including 136 patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic between February 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020. INTERVENTION: The Score for Trauma Triage in the Geriatric and Middle-Aged ORIGINAL (STTGMAORIGINAL) score was modified by adding COVID-19 virus as a risk factor for mortality to create the STTGMACOVID score. Patients were stratified into quartiles to demonstrate differences in risk distribution between the scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Inpatient and 30-day mortality, major, and minor complications. RESULTS: Both STTGMA score and COVID-19 positive/suspected status are independent predictors of inpatient mortality, confirming their use in risk assessment models for geriatric hip fracture patients. Compared with STTGMAORIGINAL, where COVID-19 patients are haphazardly distributed among the risk groups and COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities comprise 50% deaths in the minimal-risk and low-risk cohorts, the STTGMACOVID tool is able to triage 100% of COVID-19 patients and 100% of COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities into the highest risk quartile, where it was demonstrated that these patients have a 55% rate of pneumonia, a 35% rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a 22% rate of inpatient mortality, and a 35% rate of 30 days mortality. COVID-19 patients who are symptomatic on presentation to the emergency department and undergo surgical fixation have a 30% inpatient mortality rate compared with 12.5% for patients who are initially asymptomatic but later develop symptoms. CONCLUSION: The STTGMA tool can be modified for specific disease processes, in this case to account for the COVID-19 virus and provide a robust risk stratification tool that accounts for a heretofore unknown risk factor. COVID-19 positive/suspected status portends a poor outcome in this susceptible trauma population and should be included in risk assessment models. These patients should be considered a high risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 symptoms on presentation should have surgery deferred until symptoms improve or resolve and should be reassessed for surgical treatment versus definitive nonoperative treatment with palliative care and/or hospice care.

Tumour targeting of the CCK2 receptor-binding minigastrin analogue PP-F11 was determined in a tumour-bearing mouse model at increasing peptide amounts. The optimal therapy was analysed for PP-F11 labelled with (90)Y, (177)Lu or (213)Bi, accounting for the radionuclide specific activities (SAs), the tumour absorbed doses and tumour (radio) biology. METHODS Tumour uptake of (111)In-PP-F11 was determined in nude mice bearing CCK2 receptor-transfected A431 xenografts at 1 and 4 h post-injection for escalating peptide masses of 0.03 to 15 nmol/mouse. The absorbed tumour dose was estimated, assuming comparable biodistributions of the (90)Y, (177)Lu or (213)Bi radiolabelled peptides. The linear-quadratic (LQ) model was used to calculate the tumour control probabilities (TCP) as a function of tumour mass and growth. RESULTS Practically achievable maximum SAs for PP-F11 labelled with (90)Y and (177)Lu were 400 MBq (90)Y/nmol and 120 MBq(177)Lu/nmol. Both the large elution volume from the 220 MBq (225)Ac generator used and reaction kinetics diminished the maximum achieved (213)Bi SA in practice: 40 MBq (213)Bi/nmol. Tumour uptakes decreased rapidly with increasing peptide amounts, following a logarithmic curve with ED50 = 0.5 nmol. At 0.03 nmol peptide, the (300 mg) tumour dose was 9 Gy after 12 MBq (90)Y-PP-F11, and for (111)In and (177)Lu, this was 1 Gy. A curative dose of 60 Gy could be achieved with a single administration of 111 MBq (90)Y labelled to 0.28 nmol PP-F11 or with 4  17 MBq (213)Bi (0.41 nmol) when its -radiation relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was assumed to be 3.4. Repeated dosing is preferable to avoid complete tumour receptor saturation. Tumours larger than 200 mg are curable with (90)Y-PP-F11; the other radionuclides perform better in smaller tumours. Furthermore, (177)Lu is not optimal for curing fast-growing tumours. CONCLUSIONS Receptor saturation, specific radiopharmaceutical activities and absorbed doses in the tumour together favour therapy with the CCK2 receptor-binding peptide PP-F11 labelled with (90)Y, despite its longer -particle range in tissue, certainly for tumours larger than 300 mg. The predicted TCPs are of theoretical nature and need to be compared with the outcome of targeted radionuclide experiments.","output":"Therapeutic application of CCK2R-targeting PP-F11: influence of particle range, activity and peptide amount."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two major casualties to our programme have been the loss of the annual wreath-laying ceremony in Westminster Abbey and the Fellowships London Conference: both of these had a special significance in this 150th anniversary of Dickenss death (which we mark in this issue).

Yet, the pandemic policy development for rural contexts remains poorly defined. This article draws on reflections of the rural PHC response during the COVID-19 pandemic around three elements: risk, resilience, and response. Rural communities have nuanced risks related to their mobility and interaction patterns coupled with heightened population needs, socio-economic disadvantage, and access and health service infrastructure challenges. This requires specific risk assessment and communication which addresses the local context. Pandemic resilience relies on qualified and stable PHC teams using flexible responses and resources to enable streams of pandemic-related healthcare alongside ongoing primary healthcare. This depends on problem solving within limited resources and using networks and collaborations to enable healthcare for populations spread over large geographic catchments. PHC teams must secure systems for patient retrieval and managing equipment and resources including providing for situations where supply chains may fail and staff need rest.

Therefore, the present study is a content analysis of quarantine15 content on Instagram. A total of 668 posts were sampled using the hashtag quarantine15, and systematically analyzed for features related to positive and negative body image, as well as weight stigma. The results showed that the posts containing human figures (57.5 %) showcased individuals who were perceived as lower-weight (88.8 %), White (70.3 %), and women (87 %). Approximately one-third (34.4 %) of the images containing individuals were considered objectifying. Posts also perpetuated the controllability of weight through diet (51.5 %) and physical activity (27.5 %), while 46.9 % expressed dislike towards higher-weight bodies. Future experimental research in this area will be important for understanding both the acute and long-term effects of viewing quarantine15 content on body image, weight stigmatizing attitudes and thoughts, and internalized weight stigma.","output":"#quarantine15: A content analysis of Instagram posts during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Population-based data relating to vitamin D status of children in Northeast Asia are lacking.

Concerns have been raised that masks may hinder effective communication, particularly in patients with hearing loss. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of masks on speech recognition in adult patients with and without self-reported hearing loss in a clinical setting. METHODS: Adult patients presenting to an otolaryngology clinic were recruited. A digital recording of 36 spondaic words was presented to each participant in a standard clinical exam room. Each word was recorded in 1 of 3 conditions: no mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask. Participants were instructed to repeat back the word. The word recognition score was determined by the percent correctly repeated. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants were included in this study. Overall, the mean word recognition score was 87% without a mask, 78% with a surgical mask, and 61% with an N95 mask. Among the 23 subjects (51.1%) with self-reported hearing loss, the average word recognition score was 46% with an N95 mask compared to 79% in patients who reported normal hearing (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that masks significantly decrease word recognition, and this effect is exacerbated with N95 masks, particularly in patients with hearing loss. As masks are essential to allow for safe patient-physician interactions, it is imperative that clinicians are aware they may create a barrier to effective communication.","output":"Impact of Masks on Speech Recognition in Adult Patients with and without Hearing Loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article looks at three primary Head Teachers' experience of working in COVID-19 lockdown in Scotland.

Some viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr Virus infections, are known to cause malignant lymphoproliferation, like certain B-cell lymphomas. However, their role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is still debatable. Here, we report a unique case of Type-1 CG associated to a CLL transformation diagnosed in the course of a human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 91-year-old man was initially hospitalized for delirium. In a context of febrile rhinorrhea, the diagnosis of hMPV infection was made by molecular assay (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab. Owing to hyperlymphocytosis that developed during the course of the infection and unexplained peripheral neuropathy, a type-1 IgG Kappa CG secondary to a CLL was diagnosed. The patient was not treated for the CLL because of Binet A stage classification and his poor physical condition. CONCLUSIONS: We report the unique observation in the literature of CLL transformation and hMPV infection.

Objectives: The aim is to evaluate gender differences on the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the wellbeing, life habits, treatment, and healthcare access of European patients with RMDs. Methods: REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by the Health & Territory Research at the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient organisations and rheumatologists. This cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey gathering data from 1,800 patients with a diagnosis of 15 RMDs, recruited by patient organisations in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom during the first phase of the pandemic (April-July 2020). Mann-Whitney and 2 tests were used to analyse differences between gender regarding sociodemographic characteristics, life style, treatment, healthcare, and patient-reported outcomes. Results: 1,797 patients were included in this analysis. 80.2% were female and a mean age of 52.6 years. The most common diagnosis was inflammatory arthritis (81.7% male vs 73.8% female). There was a higher prevalence of fibromyalgia among females (20% vs 7.0% male). Overall, females reported worse self-perceived health (67.0% vs 51.4%, p<0.001), higher risk of anxiety (59.5% vs 48.1%, p<0.001), and depression (48.0% vs 37.2%, p<0.001). Females reported a greater increase in smoking (26.5% vs 17.5%, p=0.001), although they were less likely to drink alcohol (34.5% vs 25.4%, p=0.013), and also engaged less in physical activity (53.0% vs 60.3%, p=0.045).

Conclusion: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures have worsened self-perceived health status of patients with RMDs, affecting genders differently. Females reported worse psychological health and life habits such as increased smoking and reduced physical activity, while males increased their alcohol consumption and were less likely to attend their rheumatology appointments.","output":"Gender differences on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in patients with rheumatic diseases. results from the reumavid study (phase 1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In general, the method of choice for evaluating immunity against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is detection of antibodies against the virus in patient sera. However, this is not feasible in patients who do not produce antibodies, either due to a primary immunodeficiency or secondary to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. Assessment of the antiviral T cell response is an alternative to serological tests, but most T cell assays are labor-intensive and unsuitable for a clinical routine laboratory. We developed a flow cytometry-based assay for T cell proliferative responses against SARS-CoV-2, based on the detection of blast transformation of activated cells. The assay was validated on previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and healthy seronegative blood donors, displaying 74% sensitivity and 96% specificity for previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. The usefulness of the assay was demonstrated in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency with a history of COVID-19.

More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of NCP to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed NCP, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed NCP should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under-5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with NCP must be protected by three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.

With global distribution, high fatality rate, and no approved vaccine or effective treatment, CCHF constitutes a threat against global health. In the current study, we demonstrate that vaccination with nucleoside-modified mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP), encoding for the CCHFV nucleoprotein (N) or glycoproteins (GcGn) protect IFNAR(?/?) mice against lethal CCHFV infection. In addition, we found that both mRNA-LNP induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in IFNAR(?/?) and immunocompetent mice and that neutralizing antibodies are not necessary for protection. When evaluating immune responses induced by immunization including CCHFV Gc and Gn antigens, we found the Gc protein to be more immunogenic compared with the Gn protein. Hepatic injury is prevalent in CCHF and contributes to the severity and mortality of the disease in humans. Thus, to understand the immune response in the liver after infection and the potential effect of the vaccine, we performed a proteomic analysis on liver samples from vaccinated and control mice after CCHFV infection. Similar to observations in humans, vaccination affected the metabolic pathways. In conclusion, this study shows that a CCHFV mRNA-LNP vaccine, based on viral nucleo- or glycoproteins, mediate protection against CCHFV induced disease. Consequently, genetic immunization is an attractive approach to prevent disease caused by CCHFV and we believe we have necessary evidence to bring this vaccine platform to the next step in the development of a vaccine against CCHFV infection. IMPORTANCE Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a zoonotic pathogen causing Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a severe fever disease. CCHFV has a wide distribution and is endemic in several areas around the world. Cases of CCHF are also being reported in new areas, indicating an expansion of the disease, which is of high concern. Dispersion of the disease, high fatality rate, and no approved vaccine makes CCHF a threat to global health. The development of a vaccine is thus of great importance. Here we show 100% protection against lethal CCHFV infection in mice immunized with mRNA-LNP encoding for different CCHFV proteins. The vaccination showed both robust humoral and cellular immunity. mRNA-LNP vaccines combine the ability to induce an effective immune response, the safety of a transient carrier, and the flexibility of genetic vaccines. This and our results from the current study support the development of a mRNA-LNP based vaccine against CCHFV.","output":"Nucleoside-Modified mRNA Vaccines Protect IFNAR(C/C) Mice against Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to exceptional stress in pregnant women.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study of 150 patients with C2-C4 clinical class of primary chronic venous disease (CVD). Management consisted of initial conservative measures, following which, the patients were given a choice of continuing conservative therapy, or surgical treatment. Patients completed Specific Quality of Life and Outcome Response--Venous (SQOR-V) tool before initial visit, after completion of conservative treatment, and at 1 and 12 month follow up visits after surgical treatment. Management consisted of initial conservative measures. QOL score and symptom score (SS) part of this instrument was analyzed separately. RESULTS Conservative treatment resulted in improvement of symptom score in 85(57%) patients, and the QOL in 111(74%) patients. Despite this improvement, the majority of patients (121) chose surgical option. At the 1-month follow up after surgical treatment 97 (80%) patients reported significant improvement of their symptoms and 114 (94%) in the QOL compare to their status after conservative therapy. The QOL improvement was due mainly to improvement in symptom score. Patients who improved after conservative therapy were more than 15 times more likely to have symptoms relief at 1 month (RR = 15.6, 95% CI 4.3-56.5), and 21 times higher at 1 year after surgery (RR = 21.3, 95% CI 4.7-96.9) compared with those who did not change the SS. CONCLUSIONS Surgical treatment resulted in a better relief of symptoms compare to conservative therapy.

The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19. A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c  69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein > 88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia < 1,000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality.

In this work, we show the essential relationship between emotional regulation and reading comprehension in primary school students. After that, we study the effect of lockdown on these two processes. The aim is to have preliminary information about the challenges and effects of the current situation. To do this, a semi-structured survey has been conducted of parents and teachers in order to assess the psychological and educational effects of the current health situation. The results of 40 semi-structured telephone surveys are analyzed, 20 of parents of children with learning disorders and 20 of their classroom teachers in Traslasierra, Crdoba-Argentina. The results inform that the students and their parents have difficulties to regulate their emotions and this emotional struggle has a negative impact on comprehension of texts. The problems that previously presented in these two areas have increased due to the lack of adaptation of activities by teachers, the lack of knowledge of their parents to help them and the difficulty in accessing digital technologies. Both parents and teachers express that lockdown affects learning processes, although parents are also concerned about the effects on social life.","output":"Theoretical and applied study of the psychological and educational effects of lockdown in primary school students in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report the experience of a quaternary care center on the implementation of a care program for patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 requiring an extracorporeal oxygenation membrane METHOD: This is an experience report with a descriptive approach, analyzing the use of the extracorporeal oxygenation membrane in a quaternary care center in the city of Rio de Janeiro RESULTS: The planning for the use of the extracorporeal oxygenation membrane included training with the professionals and use of the components related to the adaptation of the protocol, equipment, facilities, quality and safety FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: Planning, resource allocation and regular training of the team to offer complex interventions, in line with recommendations for good practices in the care for patients with pulmonary complications related to the new coronavirus were essential for the development of the action plan for the use of extracorporeal oxygenation membrane in this pandemic period","output":"Implementation of care for the use of the extracorporeal oxygenation membrane in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and clinical presentation of conjunctivitis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos of Madrid, Spain. A total of 301 subjects from the COVID admission unit with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The presence and clinical characteristics of conjunctivitis were evaluated. Laboratory, radiological, and clinical results in patients with and without conjunctivitis stratified by sex were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 301 subjects included, 180 patients (59.8%) were male and the median age was 72 years (IQ 59C82). Overall, 35 patients (11.6%) were diagnosed with acute conjunctivitis. We found no relationship between the COVID-19 severity score and the presence of conjunctivitis (P = 0.17). However, conjunctivitis was more frequent in males with moderate clinical severity and in women classified as clinically mild. The natural history of the disease seems to be a rapid self-limited conjunctivitis that improves without treatment and does not affect visual acuity nor associate short-term complications. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, 1 out of 10 hospitalized non-critical COVID-19 patients presents conjunctivitis during the disease. Compared with other viral conjunctivitis, we found distinctive clinical findings that could guide defining and differentiating conjunctivitis in COVID-19 patients.

Based on its nonlinear dependence on the number of fluorophores, the origins of the phenomenon were attributed to a collective relaxation. However, the mechanism remains unknown. We present ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies which shed new light on the collective nature of the relaxation dynamics in such radiation-brightened, multi-fluorophore particles. Our findings indicate that the emission dynamics is consistent with a superradiance mechanism. The ratio between the rates of competing radiative and non-radiative relaxation pathways depends on the number of fluorophores per virus. We also discuss the evidence of coherent oscillations in the transient absorption trace from multi-fluorophore conjugated which last for $\\\\sim100$s of picoseconds, at room temperature. The findings suggest that small icosahedral virus shells provide a unique biological scaffold for developing non-classical, deep subwavelength light sources, and may open new realms for the development of photonic probes for medical imaging applications.","output":"Ultrafast Collective Excited State Dynamics of a Virus-supported Fluorophore Antenna"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the association of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet and Mediterranean-style diet with blood pressure in less-developed ethnic minority regions (LMERs). DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Dietary intakes were assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Dietary quality was assessed by the DASH-style diet score and the alternative Mediterranean-style diet (aMED) score. The association between dietary quality and blood pressure was evaluated using multivariate linear regression model. We further examined those associations in subgroups of blood pressure level. PARTICIPANTS A total of 81433 adults from the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) study were included in this study. RESULTS In the overall population, compared with the lowest quintile, the highest quintile of DASH-style diet score was negatively associated with systolic BP (coefficient: -2.78, 95% CI: -3.15 to -2.41; P-trend<0.001), while the highest quintile of aMED score had a weaker negative association with systolic BP (coefficient: -1.43, 95% CI: -1.81 to -1.05; P-trend<0.001). Both dietary indices also showed a weaker effect on diastolic BP (coefficient for DASH-style diet: -1.06, 95% CI: -1.30 to -0.82; coefficient for aMED: -0.43, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.19). In the subgroup analysis, both dietary indices showed a stronger beneficial effect on systolic BP in the hypertension group than in either of the other subgroups. CONCLUSION Our results indicated that the healthy diet originating from Western developed countries can also have beneficial effects on blood pressure in LEMRs.

The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection.

This in silico investigation explores potential modes of action of ivermectin and 14 related compounds, by which the infectivity and morbidity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be limited. Binding affinity computations were performed for these agents on several docking sites each for models of (1) the spike glycoprotein of the virus, (2) the CD147 receptor, which has been identified as a secondary attachment point for the virus, and (3) the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChr), an indicated point of viral penetration of neuronal tissue as well as an activation site for the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway controlled by the vagus nerve. Binding affinities were calculated for these multiple docking sites and binding modes of each compound. Our results indicate the high affinity of ivermectin, and even higher affinities for some of the other compounds evaluated, for all three of these molecular targets. These results suggest biological mechanisms by which ivermectin may limit the infectivity and morbidity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and stimulate an alpha 7nAChr-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway that could limit cytokine production by immune cells.","output":"In Silico Analysis of the Multi-Targeted Mode of Action of Ivermectin and Related Compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Multiple states have reported increases in opioid overdose deaths during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, however little is known about opioid-related presentations to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a time series analysis of visits to 7 EDs in greater Chicago, Illinois from October 20, 2019 to July 25, 2020. We compared the number of ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses in the time period preceding the World Health Organization pandemic declaration (prepandemic period, October 20, 2019-July 3, 2020) to the time period following the World Health Organization declaration (pandemic period, March 8, 2020 to July 25, 2020) using a single-group interrupted time series analysis with Newey-West standard errors. We also present data on alcohol-related ED visits for comparison. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 177,405 visits across the 7 EDs during the study period. The mean number of weekly ED visits in the prepandemic and pandemic periods was 4841 and 4029 weekly visits, respectively. In the interrupted time series analysis, there was no significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on opioid-related ED visits (-0.44 visits per 1000 ED visits, 95% CI -2.47 to 1.58, Pa??=a??0.66), however, there was a significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on alcohol-related ED visits (-4.1, 95% CI: -8.25 to -0.01, Pa??<a??0.05).

However, specialty medications pose unique barriers to adherence. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether pharmacist interventions improve specialty medication adherence. METHODS: This is a single-center, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial ongoing since 10 May 2019 at an integrated health system specialty pharmacy. This study evaluates usual care compared with usual care plus patient-tailored adherence interventions. Study design and procedures were informed by focus groups with patients and specialty pharmacists. Patients at Vanderbilt Specialty Pharmacy with a proportion of days covered (PDC) < 90% in the previous 4 months are identified by a daily query of the electronic pharmacy database. A pharmacist reviews these patients electronic health records to identify and exclude ineligible patients. Eligible patients are randomized evenly to the control or intervention arm and stratified by historical clinic nonadherence rates. Patients randomized to the intervention arm undergo a baseline assessment to clarify reasons for nonadherence and subsequently receive patient-tailored interventions based on their specific reasons. Interventions and follow-up are provided at the discretion of the intervening pharmacist. The primary outcome is PDC calculated at 8 months post-enrollment. Enrollment of 438 participants will provide 90% power to detect a 5% difference in PDC between the two arms within each nonadherence risk stratum. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the effect of patient-tailored interventions on specialty medication adherence and will inform how often and why patients are misidentified as nonadherent.

Traditional healers are frequently consulted as primary care-givers for snakebite victims in distress. Traditional healers therefore present a valuable source of information about how snakebite is perceived and handled at the community level, an understanding of which is critical to improve and extend snakebite-related healthcare. METHOD: The study was approached from the interpretive paradigm with phenomenology as a methodology. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 traditional healers who treat snakebite patients in two rural settings in Ghana. From the Ashanti and Upper West regions respectively, 11 and 8 healers were purposively sampled. Interview data was coded, collated and analysed thematically using ATLAS.ti 8 software. Demographic statistics were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26. FINDINGS: Snakebite was reportedly a frequent occurrence, perceived as dangerous and often deadly by healers. Healers felt optimistic in establishing a diagnosis of snakebite using a multitude of methods, ranging from herbal applications to spiritual consultations. They were equally confident about their therapies; encompassing the administration of plant and animal-based concoctions and manipulations of bite wounds. Traditional healers were consulted for both physical and spiritual manifestations of snakebite or after insufficient pain control and lack of antivenom at hospitals; referrals by healers to hospitals were primarily done to receive antivenom and care for wound complications. Most healers welcomed opportunities to engage more productively with hospitals and clinical staff. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that traditional healers did sometimes refer victims to hospitals indicates that improvement of antivenom stocks, pain management and wound care can potentially improve health seeking at hospitals. Our results emphasize the need to explore future avenues for communication and collaboration with traditional healers to improve health seeking behaviour and the delivery of much-needed healthcare to snakebite victims.","output":"The medicine is not for sale: Practices of traditional healers in snakebite envenoming in Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Management of the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) remains challenging.

The aim of the present paper is to describe our nMTB, to evaluate its impact on clinical management decisions, and to assess the role of neuroradiologists. Methods: The retrospective evaluation of the cases discussed at our nMTB from March 2017 to March 2020. From the electronic records, we extracted epidemiological, clinical and other specific data of nMTB. From the radiological records, we calculated data relating to the number, time for revision, and other specifications of MRI re-evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: a total of 447 discussions were analyzed, representing 342 patients. The requests for case evaluations came from radiation oncologists (58.8%) and neurosurgeons (40.5%), and were mainly addressed to the neuroradiologist (73.8%). The most frequent questions were about the treatments changes (64.4%). The change in patient treatment was reported in 40.5% of cases, 76.8% of these were based on the neuroradiologic assessment. A total of 1514 MRI examinations were re-evaluated, employing approximately 67 h overall. The median of the MRI exams reviewed per patient was 3 (minCmax 1C12). Conclusions: Our study supported that the multidisciplinary approach to patient care can be particularly effective in managing brain tumors. A review by an expert neuroradiologist impacts patient management in the context of nMTBs, but has costs in terms of the time and effort spent preparing for it.","output":"Neuro-Oncology Multidisciplinary Tumor Board: The Point of View of the Neuroradiologist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Many mental health conditions are associated with loneliness, which is both a potential trigger and an exacerbating factor in mental health conditions. Richer evidence about how people with mental health problems experience loneliness, and about what exacerbates or alleviates it, is needed to underpin research on strategies to help with loneliness in this context. Methods Our aim was to explore experiences of loneliness, as well as what contributes to or helps address it, among a diverse sample of adults living with mental health problems in the UK. We recruited purposively via online networks and community organisations. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 59 consenting participants by video call or telephone. Researchers with relevant lived experience were involved at all stages, including design, data collection, analysis and writing up of results. Findings Analysis led to identification of four overarching themes: 1. What the word lonely meant to participants, 2. Contributory factors to ongoing loneliness, 3. Connections between loneliness & mental health, 4. Ways of reducing loneliness. Central aspects of loneliness were lack of meaningful connections with others and lack of a sense of belonging to valued groups and communities. Some drivers of loneliness, such as losses and transitions, were universal, but specific links were made between living with mental health problems and being lonely. These included direct effects of psychiatric symptoms, the need to withdraw to cope with mental health problems, and impacts of stigma and poverty. Conclusions The multiplicity of contributors to loneliness that we identified, and of potential strategies for reducing it, suggest that a variety of approaches are relevant to reducing loneliness among people with mental health problems, including peer support and supported self-help, psychological and social interventions, and strategies to facilitate change at community and societal levels. The views and experiences of adults living with mental health problems are a rich source for understanding why loneliness is a frequent experience in this context and what may address it. Co-produced approaches to developing and testing interventions have potential to draw on this experiential knowledge in formulating effective approaches to loneliness.","output":"Exploring the experiences of loneliness in adults with mental health problems: a co-produced participatory qualitative interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to distill knowledge gained from the impact of COVID-19 on psychology clinical training and education at the graduate level We explore our experiences as counselling psychology doctoral students who were completing practica when the pandemic occurred, and mental health services were adapting to rapidly changing circumstances We employed a polyethnographic qualitative research design, informed by a developmental lens, to identify ourselves as the site of research and participate in a polyvocal and reflexive conversation Subsequently, using thematic analysis to analyze our conversation, we traced how our growth was influenced during this unprecedented disruption in clinical training Our conversation yielded seven themes and a related emerging conceptual representation that has implications for graduate training and education, with relevance to crisis situations We position structured and ongoing relational support as a core process that helped us address both losses and disappointments while continuing to provide competent care to others (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement This study highlights the impact of COVID-19 on doctoral student clinical training and education The results suggest the importance of reflexivity, flexibility of practice, supervision, peer relationships, contingency planning, and the need for telehealth training to be incorporated into doctoral clinical practica, supervision, and education (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Growth during a global pandemic: A polyethnography among doctoral counselling psychology students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Understanding personal factors that influence diverse responses to health care information, such as preferences for more or less health care, might be beneficial to more effective communication and better involvement in health care choices. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether individuals preferences for more or less health care are associated with informed choice and understanding of overdiagnosis in routine prostate cancer screening and to examine associations among preferences, educational status, and health literacy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study included a community-based sample of men in Australia aged 45 to 60 years eligible for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, recruited via an international social research company. Survey data were collected online from June 27 to July 26, 2018. Data were analyzed in April 2020. EXPOSURES: Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 versions of an online decision aid (full-length or abbreviated) about PSA screening and completed an online survey that included a measure of preference for more or less health care, the Medical Maximizer-Minimizer Scale (MMS), in which higher score indicates preference for more health care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was informed choice; knowledge, attitudes, and intentions about screening for prostate cancer were also measured. RESULTS: Of 3722 participants who began the survey, 2993 (80.4%) completed it (mean [SD] age, 52.15 [6.65] years). Stronger preferences for more heath care were observed in those without tertiary education (mean difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.22; P < .001) and with inadequate health literacy (mean difference, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09-0.22; P < .001). After controlling for health and demographic variables, a 1-unit increase in MMS score was associated with reduced relative risk (RR) of making an informed choice (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74-0.82; P < .001) and of having adequate conceptual knowledge (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.90; P < .001), correct numerical knowledge (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.97; P = .001), and correct understanding of overdiagnosis (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.90; P < .001). A 1-unit increase in MMS score was associated with a more positive attitude toward screening (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15-1.21; P < .001) and more positive intention to screen (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.16-1.25; P < .001) after adjusting for control variables. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study examined associations between preferences for more or less health care and knowledge about overdiagnosis and informed choice among men in Australia. These results may motivate clinicians to elicit individual patient preferences to facilitate tailored discussions with patients about low-value care, such as prostate cancer screening, for which benefit is uncertain.","output":"Preferences for More or Less Health Care and Association With Health Literacy of Men Eligible for Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has gained broad acceptance among pediatric surgeons. Today, VATS can be regarded as a routine approach for various conditions in neonates and infants. However, there is a lack of information concerning the complications of thoracoscopic pulmonary surgery in neonates and infants. We aimed to review the available data. A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed. All publications reporting on VATS for pulmonary procedures in neonates and infants up to the age of 1 year were included. Articles were reviewed in detail for occurrence of perioperative complications and their treatment. Nine case series were eligible for analysis. Entities treated included lung sequestration, congenital pulmonary airway malformation, congenital lobar emphysema, and bronchogenic cyst. Case series reported on a total number of 135 patients. Complications occurred in 14 patients (10.4%). The major complication was an accidental transection of the middle lobar bronchus that concluded in a later resection of a prior unaffected lung lobe. Other relevant complications reported were bleeding in four patients (3.0%) and persistent air leak in four cases (3.0%). Infectious complications were reported in four patients (3.0%). Additionally, iatrogenic phrenic nerve paralysis occurred in one patient. There were no deaths related to the VATS technique. In 11 cases (8.1%), conversion to thoracotomy had been necessary. General recommendations on the treatment of complications could not be derived due to small patient numbers and lack of details of the complications reported. Reports on major complications of pulmonary VATS in neonates and infants below 1 year of age are scarce. As severe complications such as accidental bronchus transection have been described, feasibility of neonatal/infant VATS cannot be unequivocally confirmed.

We evaluated main drivers of distribution of three conspicuous damselfishes, along tropical and subtropical coastal systems, in Brazil. Abundances were assessed against wave exposure, depth (within 1-7 m in tropical and 1-11 m in subtropical reefs) and benthic cover. Despite differences between systems, exposure and depth consistently explained damselfishes distribution. Stegastes fuscus, the larger damselfish species of the genus in the southwestern Atlantic, was dominant in both systems, inhabiting preferably shallow and sheltered reefs. Conversely, Stegastes variabilis occupied shallow habitats with higher exposure. Stegastes pictus was absent from tropical reefs sampled, inhabiting depths >7 m, in subtropical reefs. Species were weakly associated with benthic features, which poorly predicted changes in abundances. Regardless, S. fuscus showed association with articulated calcareous algae, and S. variabilis juveniles associated with erect macroalgae. Despite occurring in very distinctive reef systems, Brazilian damsels habitat requirements are consistent in both tropical and subtropical reefs.

MODIS satellite images are used together with gridded weather data to model biometeorological parameters at the Fruit Circuit region, state of S?o Paulo, Southeast Brazil. This region has experienced some cases of drought, while arising rainfall water excess in some periods, demanding large-scale water and energy balance studies to subsidize water resource policies. The SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm was applied together with the radiation-use efficiency (RUE) model for biometeorological index assessments. The highest latent heat fluxes (&#955;E), above 8.0 MJ m-2 d-1, at the end of the year, coincide with the progressive increases on both rainfall and global solar radiation (RG) levels, and drop to below 5.0 MJ m-2 d-1 in the middle of the year, during the driest conditions. The same tendencies along the year are verified for sensible heat fluxes (H), for which mean pixel values are above 3.5 MJ m-2 d-1 at the end of the year. On the one hand, the highest values for water productivity (WP), which is considered the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ET) to biomass production (BIO), above 4.0 kg m-3, are verified in April, period under increasing BIO and low ET rates. On the other hand, the lowest WP values (below 2.0 kg m-3) occur between August and October, when BIO is low, and ET is high. Although the area featuring good WP levels under high precipitation (P), with rainfalls generally above ET, supplementary irrigation may benefit agriculture in some periods of the year. The results of the large-scale modeling showed applicability of the models for monitoring water and vegetation dynamics over 16-day timescale and at a 250-m spatial resolution in areas experiencing climate and land-use changes by combining climate data and MODIS images. Application of these tools enables to indicate the best options for expanding the agriculture activities, being of great potential for rational natural resources management, in regions under environmental vulnerability conditions.","output":"Modeling large-scale biometeorological indices to monitor agricultural-growing areas: applications in the fruit circuit region, S?o Paulo, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The best way to ensure that preterm infants benefit from relevant neonatal expertise as soon as they are born is to transfer the mother and baby to an appropriately specialised neonatal facility before birth (\\" in utero\\"). This review explores the evidence surrounding the importance of being born in the right unit, the advantages of in utero transfers compared to ex utero transfers, and how to accurately assess which women are at most risk of delivering early and the challenges of in utero transfers. Accurate identification of the women most at risk of preterm birth is key to prioritising who to transfer antenatally, but the administrative burden and pathway variation of in utero transfer in the UK are likely to compromise optimal clinical care. Women reported the impact that in utero transfers have on them, including the emotional and financial burdens of being transferred and the anxiety surrounding domestic and logistical concerns related to being away from home. The final section of the review explores new approaches to reforming the in utero transfer process, including learning from outside the UK and changing policy and guidelines. Examples of collaborative regional guidance include the recent Pan-London guidance on in utero transfers. Reforming the transfer process can also be aided through technology, such as utilising the CotFinder app. In utero transfer is an unavoidable aspect of maternity and neonatal care, and the burden will increase if preterm birth rates continue to rise in association with increased rates of multiple pregnancy, advancing maternal age, assisted reproductive technologies, and obstetric interventions. As funding and capacity pressures on health services increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic, better prioritisation and sustained multi-disciplinary commitment are essential to maximise better outcomes for babies born too soon.","output":"All the right moves: why in utero transfer is both important for the baby and difficult to achieve and new strategies for change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual health, sexual behaviour, well-being, and access to sexual health services among university students in Canada. Between December 2020 and January 2021, 1504 university students across Canada completed an online survey focused on overall sexual health, well-being, solitary sexual behaviours, partnered sexual interactions, and access to sexual health services. The survey was designed by the Sex Information & Education Council of Canada and administered by the Leger polling company. Reported levels of overall sexual health were high. Cisgender women reported significantly greater scores of COVID-19-related stress compared to cisgender men;LGBQ+ students had higher levels of stress compared to heterosexual participants. Overall, solitary sexual behaviours (i.e., masturbation, porn use, vibrator use) remained unchanged or were perceived to increase compared to the time before the pandemic. Cisgender men reported higher scores (i.e., greater perceived increases) on masturbation and porn use than cisgender women. Frequency of sex with casual partners was perceived as similar or lower than what was usual before the pandemic, and most participants did not engage in sex where the close personal contact put them or their partner at risk for COVID-19. Declines in access were reported for all sexual health care services surveyed, with cisgender women and students of colour more likely to report decreased access to services.

However, little is known about the moderating effects of disability on mobile internet use among older adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the levels of mobile internet use and factors associated with this use among older adults according to their disabilities. In addition, moderating effects of disability on mobile internet use were investigated. METHODS: This study consisted of a secondary data analysis using the 2020 Digital Divide Survey conducted in South Korea. The single inclusion criterion was participants being aged 55 years or older; accordingly, 2243 people without disabilities and 1386 people with disabilities were included in the study. Multiple regression analyses considering complex sample designs were conducted to identify mobile internet use factors and to test the moderating effects of disability on mobile internet use. RESULTS: Older adults with disabilities used mobile internet less than older adults without disabilities. However, disability status had moderating effects on the relationships between mobile internet use and (1) operational skills regarding mobile devices (B=0.31, P=.004), (2) internet use skills (B=1.46, P<.001), (3) motivation to use digital devices (B=0.46, P=.01), and (4) attitude toward new technology (B=0.50, P=.002). The results revealed that these positive relationships were stronger among older adults with disabilities than among adults without disabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Although older adults and people with disabilities are considered vulnerable populations regarding technology adoption, disability creates a stronger association between several determinants and actual mobile internet use. Therefore, policy makers and practitioners should pay attention to older adults with disabilities to deliver appropriate information-literacy education.

This complex was characterized by different spectroscopic and physicochemical methods. Single crystal X-ray crystallography study revealed that Cu(II) in complex (1) is five-coordinate and adopts a distorted square pyramidal geometry. A DFT calculation was employed to evaluate the optimized electronic structure, HOMO-LUMO, energy gap, and global parameters. A detailed structural and non-covalent interaction on the complex is investigated by single crystal structure analysis and computational approaches. The strength of the interaction and 3D topology of the crystal packing are visualized through an energy framework. Hirshfeld surface and 2D fingerprint plots have been explored in the crystal structure of the complex. The anticancer properties of copper(II) complex was studied against the selected cancerous cell lines of breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, molecular docking and MD simulations was performed on the complex to predict the binding mode and interactions between the ligand and the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 7CBT and 7D1M).

However, community stakeholders, especially those in low-income settings, are at risk of being excluded from research and community engagement initiatives during and after the COVID-19 pandemic because of the rapid transition to digital operations. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the implementation and feasibility of a program called Addressing the Digital Divide to Improve Patient-Centered Outcomes Research, which was designed to address barriers to technology use, and to examine changes in participants perceived comfort with digital technology before and after the program. METHODS: To promote full engagement, we worked with 20 existing community leaders to cocreate a training course on using digital technology. We assessed the frequency of technology use and comfort with technology through an adapted 8-item version of the Functional Assessment of Comfort Employing Technology Scale and used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for survey analysis. We also conducted a focus group session with 10 participants and then performed reflective journaling and content analysis to determine emergent themes. RESULTS: We found that the program was feasible to implement and worthwhile for participants (15/16, 94%).

Parents responded to questionnaires online about their financial situation, personal well\\\\being, relationship with their oldest typically developing adolescent (12C18 years old;Mage = 14.74;SDage = 1.80;46.4% young women), and their adolescents well\\\\being.Higher levels of financial stress were related to higher levels of parental psychological distress, higher levels of parenting stress, and higher levels of adolescent loneliness. Higher stay\\\\at\\\\home intensity was related to higher levels of parenting stress, higher levels of parentCadolescent conflict, and poorer adolescent adjustment. Several significant indirect paths were identified between financial stress and adolescents adjustment. The relationship between financial stress and adolescents well\\\\being (i.e., internalizing behaviors and loneliness) was mediated by parental psychological distress and parenting stress. When parenting stress was a mediator, the effect was more pronounced the more time families spent at home.Parents who were worried about their financial situation had greater difficulty with psychological distress and parenting stress, especially when parents were spending more time at home.Understanding the way in which financial stress influences parents and adolescents adjustment during the pandemic will inform and prepare practitioners and policymakers for similar situations in the future.

However, tuning of parameters of hierarchical models, including the number of topics on each hierarchical level, remains a challenging task and an open issue. In this paper, we propose a Renyi entropy-based approach for a partial solution to the above problem. First, we propose a Renyi entropy-based metric of quality for hierarchical models. Second, we propose a practical concept of hierarchical topic model tuning tested on datasets with human mark-up. In the numerical experiments, we consider three different hierarchical models, namely, hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (hLDA) model, hierarchical Pachinko allocation model (hPAM), and hierarchical additive regularization of topic models (hARTM).

The ongoing pandemic demonstrates the importance of having an emergency response plan that accounts for the safety of frontline healthcare workers, including those working in critical care settings. OBJECTIVES: To explore Australian critical care nurses knowledge, preparedness and experiences of managing patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. METHODS: An exploratory cross-sectional study of Australian critical care nurses was conducted between June and September 2020. An anonymous online survey was sent to Australian College of Critical Care Nurses (ACCCN) members to collect information about their knowledge, preparedness and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise and report data. RESULTS: A total of 157 critical care nurses participated, with 138 fully complete surveys analysed. Most respondents reported good to very good level of knowledge about COVID-19, and obtained up-to-date COVID-19 information from international and local sources. To manage patients with COVID-19, 82.3% felt sufficiently prepared at the time of data collection, and 93.4% had received specific education, training or instruction. Most participants were involved in assessing (89.3%) and treating (92.4%) COVID-19 patients. Varying levels of concerns about contracting SARS-CoV-2 were expressed by respondents, and 55.7% thought the pandemic had increased their workload. The most frequent concerns expressed by participants were a lack of appropriate PPE and fear of the PPE shortage. CONCLUSIONS: While most nurses expressed sufficient preparedness for managing COVID-19 patients, specific education had been undertaken and experiential learning was evident. Fears of insufficient or appropriate PPE made the response more difficult for nurses and the community. Preparedness and responsiveness are critical to successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.","output":"Australian critical care nurses knowledge, preparedness and experiences of managing SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe immunopathological pathways enabling post-COVID syndrome (PCS) development are not entirely known. We underwent a longitudinal analysis of patients with COVID-19 who developed PCS aiming to evaluate the autoimmune and immunological status associated with this condition. MethodsThirty-three patients were included for longitudinal clinical and autoantibody analyses of whom 12 patients were assessed for cytokines and lymphocyte populations. Patients were followed during 7-11 months after acute COVID-19. Autoimmune profile and immunological status were evaluated mainly by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays and flow cytometry. ResultsLatent autoimmunity and overt autoimmunity persisted over time. A proinflammatory state was observed in patients with PCS characterized by upregulated IFN-, TNF-, G-CSF, IL-17A, IL-6, IL-1{beta}, and IL-13, whereas IP-10 was decreased. In addition, PCS was characterized by increased levels of Th9, CD8+ effector T cells, naive B cells, and CD4+ effector memory T cells. Total levels of IgG S1-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remained elevated over time. DiscussionThe clinical manifestations of PCS are associated with the persistence of a proinflammatory, and effector phenotype induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This long-term persistent immune activation may contribute to the development of latent and overt autoimmunity.

Only limited data have been available to explore this hypothesis. Objective: To assess the interrelationship(s) between COVID-19 and HAE. Methods: Self-reported COVID-19 infection, complications, morbidity, and mortality were surveyed by using an online questionnaire. The participants included subjects with HAE with C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency (HAE-C1INH) and subjects with HAE with normal C1-inhibitor (HAE-nl-C1INH), and household controls (normal controls). The impact of HAE medications was examined. Results: A total of 1162 participants who completed the survey were analyzed, including: 695 subjects with HAE-C1INH, 175 subjects with HAE-nl-C1INH, and 292 normal controls. The incidence of reported COVID-19 was not significantly different between the normal controls (9%) and the subjects with HAE-C1INH (11%) but was greater in the subjects with HAE-nl-C1INH (19%; p = 0.006). Obesity was positively correlated with COVID-19 across the overall population (p = 0.012), with a similar but nonsignificant trend in the subjects with HAE-C1INH. Comorbid autoimmune disease was a risk factor for COVID-19 in the subjects with HAE-C1INH (p = 0.047). COVID-19 severity and complications were similar in all the groups. Reported COVID-19 was reduced in the subjects with HAE-C1INH who received prophylactic subcutaneous C1INH (5.6%; p = 0.0371) or on-demand icatibant (7.8%; p = 0.0016). The subjects with HAE-C1INH and not on any HAE medications had an increased risk of COVID-19 compared with the normal controls (24.5%; p = 0.006). Conclusion: The subjects with HAE-C1INH who were not taking HAE medications had a significantly higher rate of reported COVID-19 infection.

Effects of the lockdown on childbirth outcomes and on the well-being of both the mother and the child have not yet been defined. An inadequate diet during pregnancy and a reduced physical activity can predispose women to become overweight or obese and trigger the development of various complications and maternal-fetal adverse outcomes. METHODS This is a retrospective study including all consecutive patients who delivered at University Hospital Maggiore della Carit in Novara, Italy, in April-May 2017 (group 1, n=294), a period prior to the pandemic, and during the same months in 2020 (group 2, n=256) during and immediately after lockdown. Clinical data were extracted from The Report \\"Childbirth Assistance Certificate (CedAP) - Birth Event Analysis\\". RESULTS Demographic characteristics were similar between the two study groups, except for a decreased number of married couples in group 2 (p-value 0.018) and an increased percentage of patients with clinical checkups at Family Planning facilities in 2020 (p-value 0.04). The number of hospitalizations during pregnancy was 26 (8.9%) vs 10 (3.9%) with a significative reduction during 2020 (p-value 0.004). Regarding obstetric outcomes, we observed a significant increase in induction of labour in 2020 (23.9% vs 35.9%; p-value 0. 002), a reduction of amniorrhexis (11.3% vs 5.5% p-value 0.015), a reduction of supine positions with an increase of vertical and all fours positions in 2020 (49.3% vs 61.9% and 9.5% vs 12.4% respectively, p 0.023), and a reduction of left occipito-anterior presented part (63.2% vs 55.4%) in favor of right occipito-anterior (34.7% vs 41.2%, p-value 0.019).

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a special complex of therapeutic (vestibular) gymnastics and training with biofeedback (BFB) on a stabiloplatform in the rehabilitation of patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy with vestibulo-atactic syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort prospective single-center randomized comparative study of the clinical effectiveness of the author's complex of therapeutic exercises and stabilometric training with BFB in the complex treatment of patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy with vestibulo-atactic syndrome was carried out. The study involved 40 patients aged 65-89 years who were randomized into 2 equal groups. Patients of the 1st group, against the background of drug therapy and physiotherapy, were trained on a stabiloplatform with BFB (a training game according to the manufacturer's instructions). Patients of the 2nd group performed a complex of therapeutic (vestibular) gymnastics specially designed for this study. The effectiveness of physical rehabilitation was assessed by the dynamics of (1) subjective symptoms (complaints of patients), (2) indicators of stabilometry (symmetry index, the sum of the coordination indices for the right and left legs, fluctuation) and (3) the results of functional testing using the Get up and go test, the Berg balance scale and the Tinetti mobility scale. RESULTS: In the group of patients who performed vestibular gymnastics, in contrast to patients who participated in training using a multifunctional stabiloplatform with BFB, a statistically significant improvement was revealed when assessed by the Get up and go test and the Berg balance scale. In none of the groups, a distinct dynamics of stabilometry indicators was registered. No correlation was found between the main indicators of stabilometry and the data of functional tests. CONCLUSION: Thus, vestibular gymnastics has demonstrated greater effectiveness in the rehabilitation of patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy and vestibulo-atactic syndrome in comparison with stabilometric training with biofeedback.

However, relatively little is known about whether resveratrol modulates the ion channels in cortical neurons. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)) and voltage-gated sodium channels were expressed in cortical neurons and play important roles in regulation of neuronal excitability. The present study aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol on BK(Ca) currents and voltage-gated sodium currents in cortical neurons. RESULTS: Resveratrol concentration-dependently increased the current amplitude and the opening activity of BK(Ca) channels, but suppressed the amplitude of voltage-gated sodium currents. Similar to the BK(Ca) channel opener NS1619, resveratrol decreased the firing rate of action potentials. In addition, the enhancing effects of BK(Ca) channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and paxilline on action potential firing were sensitive to resveratrol. Our results indicated that the attenuation of action potential firing rate by resveratrol might be mediated through opening the BK(Ca) channels and closing the voltage-gated sodium channels. CONCLUSIONS: As BK(Ca) channels and sodium channels are critical molecular determinants for seizure generation, our findings suggest that regulation of these two channels in cortical neurons probably makes a considerable contribution to the antiseizure activity of resveratrol.","output":"Resveratrol attenuates cortical neuron activity: roles of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels and voltage-gated sodium channels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), a contagious disease, is a global pandemic affecting the lives and health of individuals across borders, genders and races.

We demonstrated that the protection is mediated by IFN (Interferon) -secreting CD4(+) T-effector cells and multifunctional T cells, which is analogous to leishmanization. In addition, in a leishmanization model, skin tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells were also shown to be crucial for host protection.

METHODS: To evaluate age-related immunologic alterations in MS, we compared immune signatures in peripheral blood (PB) and CSF by flow cytometry in patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) (PB n = 38; CSF n = 51) and primary progressive (PP) MS (PB n = 40; CSF n = 36) and respective controls (PB n = 40; CSF n = 85). RESULTS: Analysis revealed significant age-related changes in blood immune cell composition, especially in the CD8 T-cell compartment of healthy donors (HDs) and patients with MS. However, HDs displayed a strong age-dependent decline in the expression of the immunoregulatory molecules KLRG1, LAG3, and CTLA-4 on memory CD8 T cells, whereas this age-dependent reduction was completely abrogated in patients with MS. An age-dependent increase in the expression of the costimulatory molecule CD226 on memory CD8 T cells was absent in patients with MS. CD226 expression correlated with disability in younger (50 years) patients with MS. CSF analysis revealed a significant age-dependent decline in various immune cell populations in PPMS but not RRMS, suggesting a differential effect of aging on the intrathecal compartment in PPMS. DISCUSSION: Our data illustrate that aging in MS is associated with a dysbalance between costimulatory and immunoregulatory signals provided by CD8 T cells favoring a proinflammatory phenotype and, more importantly, a pattern of premature immune aging in the CD8 T-cell compartment of young patients with MS with potential implications for disease severity.","output":"Evaluation of Age-Dependent Immune Signatures in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads rapidly among people and causes a global pandemic.

As a quick, non-invasive technique of peripheral nerve stimulation, acupuncture has emerged as a promising therapy to provide significant advantages for immunomodulation in acute inflammation. Acupuncture obtains its regulatory effect by activating the somatic-autonomic-immune reflexes, including the somatic-sympathetic-splenic reflex, the somatic-sympathetic-adrenal reflex, the somatic-vagal-splenic reflex and the somatic-vagal-adrenal reflex, which produces a systemic effect.

METHODS: At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic patients admitted to our hospital were treated with the empiric association of HY/RD; one week later the therapeutic protocol was modified with the combination of HY/AZ. Patients underwent an ECG at baseline, then 3 and 7 days after starting therapy. We prospectively enrolled 113 patients (61 in the HY/RD group-52 in the HY/AZ group). RESULTS: A significant increase in median QTc was reported after seven days of therapy in both groups: from 438 to 452 ms in HY/RD patients; from 433 to 440 ms in HY/AZ patients (p = 0.001 for both). 23 patients (21.2%) had a QTc > 500 ms at 7 days.

Although masks can slow down the spread of viruses, their efficacy in gathering environments involving heterogeneous person-to-person contacts remains unknown. Therefore, we aim to investigate the epidemic prevention effect of masks in different real-life gathering environments. This study uses four real interpersonal contact datasets to construct four empirical networks to represent four gathering environments. The transmission of COVID-19 is simulated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The heterogeneity of individuals can cause mask efficacy in a specific gathering environment to be different from the baseline efficacy in general society. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of gathering environments causes the epidemic prevention effect of masks to differ. Wearing masks can greatly reduce the probability of clustered epidemics and the infection scale in primary schools, high schools, and hospitals. However, the use of masks alone in primary schools and hospitals cannot control outbreaks. In high schools with social distancing between classes and in workplaces where the interpersonal contact is relatively sparse, masks can meet the need for prevention. Given the heterogeneity of individual behavior, if individuals who are more active in terms of interpersonal contact are prioritized for mask-wearing, the epidemic prevention effect of masks can be improved. Finally, asymptomatic infection has varying effects on the prevention effect of masks in different environments. The effect can be weakened or eliminated by increasing the usage rate of masks in high schools and workplaces. However, the effect on primary schools and hospitals cannot be weakened. This study contributes to the accurate evaluation of mask efficacy in various gathering environments to provide scientific guidance for epidemic prevention.","output":"Heterogeneous influence of individuals behavior on mask efficacy in gathering environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Appropriate laboratory testing is critical in today's healthcare environment that aims to improve patient care while reducing cost.

To investigate the association of the pandemic-related impacts with the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with melanoma. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to melanoma patients through social media. Demographic and clinical data, and pandemic-related impacts (unemployment and income loss) were collected. HRQoL was determined by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and its disease-specific module (the melanoma subscale, MS). A total of 135 patients with melanoma completed the study. The mean age of the patients was 55.8  14.2 years, 48.1% (65/135) were male, and 17.04% (34/135) were unemployed since the epidemic. Unemployment of the patients and their family members and income loss were significantly associated with a lower FACT-G score, while the MS score was associated with the unemployment of the patients' family members.

Given the unique clinical characteristics of youth with ASD, there have been significant efforts to adapt and test mental health interventions for this population. Yet, characterization of the nature and types of interventions adaptations is limited, especially across the wide range of interventions tested for youth with ASD with a focus on implementation factors. Additionally, understanding how these interventions may be implemented in community services is limited. The aims of this systematic review are to characterize the (1) types of interventions tested for co-occurring mental health conditions for youth with ASD; (2) adaptations to mental health interventions for use with youth with ASD; and (3) implementation strategies, outcomes, and determinants of mental health interventions to inform their translation to community service settings. Eighty-three articles testing interventions targeting mental health symptoms in youth with ASD that included implementation factors in analyses were reviewed. The Stirman et al. (2013; 2019) FRAME adaptation, Powell et al. (2012;2015) implementation strategies, and Proctor et al. (2011) implementation outcomes taxonomies were applied to characterize the nature and types of adaptations for use with youth with ASD and types of implementation strategies, outcomes, and determinants used, when available, respectively. Of the interventions examined, the majority (64.1%) were originally designed to target youth mental health concerns and were then adapted to be used with ASD. The most common adaptations included those to the intervention content, particularly adding elements with tailoring or refining aspects of the intervention while maintaining core functions. Half of the articles described at least one implementation strategy used during intervention testing. Fidelity and acceptability were the most frequently examined implementation outcomes, with some examination of appropriateness and feasibility. Nineteen percent of articles described implementation determinants (i.e. barriers/facilitators) of these implementation outcomes. The common adaptations for ASD provide direction for future intervention development and for training community therapists. Further examination, specification, and reporting of implementation strategies and outcomes within ongoing efforts to adapt and interventions to meet the co-occurring mental health needs of youth ASD are needed to facilitate their translation to community settings.

MEASURES: Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record. The data included: date of birth, gender, ethnicity, race, marital status, medications (active COVID-19 agents), weight and height (from which the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, history of smoking, and comorbid conditions to calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) multi-morbidity score. An additional COVID-19 Risk Score was also included. Outcomes included hospital admission, ICU admission, and death. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the impact on mortality or hospital admission.

METHODS: An online survey was run from February 19 to March 6, 2020; a total of 2,182 Chinese subjects participated. Mental health variables were assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). RESULTS: Compared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p < 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p< 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%; p < 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p  0.01).

The H oilfield in Iraq commenced production curtailment in early March 2020 and then oil production gradually decreased. By the end of 2020, production was less than one-third of the rate before curtailment. There are multiple sets of oil-bearing formations in the H Oilfield vertically. The developed oil reservoirs have a total of more than three hundreds development wells. The reservoir types are diverse, the relationship among multiphase fluids is complex, and the development methods are different. The reduction of the daily production will inevitably require a comprehensive strategy adjustment to cope with the new situation. Any intentional or unintentional shut-in has a price. Therefore, the key is how to reasonably control the production in many oil reservoirs and re-adjust the oil reservoir development plan at the minimum cost while meeting the overall changing production restriction target for each oil reservoir. In this study, the author established a simple and fast process for judging open and closed wells through years of experience in reservoir dynamic analysis and field management. Step 1: Wells are classified according to production characteristics. For pre-selected wells, some wells with unique functions that need to be opened and those that need to be closed for objective reasons should be excluded. Step 2: Conduct single well cost analysis with reference to production status. Respectively evaluate the performance of the production well under the state of opening and closing. Step 3: Establish the model with economic indicators as the objective function. According to different goals, the model established is slightly different. Step 4: Optimize the best solution based on actual needs. Solve the optimal solution under the target and optimize the number of reasonably configured wells in each reservoir. Through this process, combined with historical and current actual production conditions, different types of oil wells in all reservoirs are classified. Their priorities of reopening are evaluated to meet the needs of other production restriction targets and ensure the smooth transition of oilfield development. ?

The foremost predominant complication of SARS-CoV-2 is arterial hypoxemia thereby disturbing lung compliance, requiring mechanical ventilation. The aim of the current research study is to analyze role of ABG as a valuable assessment tool of disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Methods 170 arterial blood samples were collected from patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Sri Guru Ram Das Charitable Hospital, Amritsar. They were analyzed for arterial blood gas using ABG analyzer. Parameters of ABG such as pH, pCO2, HCO3, O2 saturation, ionized calcium (iCa) and calculated ionized calcium (at pH 7.4) was calculated for all the samples. Results Continuous variables were described as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and categorical variables as percentages and frequencies. Spearman correlation test was done for calculation of correlation between pH and other ABG parameters. Analysis of arterial blood gas revealed significant negative correlation (p<0.05) between pH and pCO2 and significant positive correlation (p<0.05) between pH and HCO3 and between pH and delta ionized calcium. Low levels (98.2%) of ionized calcium were observed while monitoring the ABG findings though weak negative correlation (p<0.05) was observed between pH and iCa.

The B.1.1.529 Omicron variant is rapidly emerging and has been designated a Variant of Concern (VOC). The variant is highly transmissible and partially or fully evades a spectrum of neutralising antibodies due to a high number of substitutions in the spike glycoprotein. A major question is the relative severity of disease caused by the Omicron variant compared with previous and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. To address this, a mouse model of infection that recapitulates severe disease in humans, K18-hACE2 mice, were infected with either a Pango B, Delta or Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and their relative pathogenesis compared. In contrast to mice infected with Pango B and Delta variant viruses, those infected with the Omicron variant had less severe clinical signs (weight loss), showed recovery and had a lower virus load in both the lower and upper respiratory tract. This is also reflected by less extensive inflammatory processes in the lungs. Although T cell epitopes may be conserved, the antigenic diversity of Omicron from previous variants would suggest that a change in vaccine may be required to mitigate against the higher transmissibility and global disease burden. However, the lead time to develop such a response may be too late to mitigate the spread and effects of Omicron. These animal model data suggest the clinical consequences of infection with the Omicron variant may be less severe but the higher transmissibility could still place huge burden upon healthcare systems even if a lower proportion of infected patients are hospitalised.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-B.1.1.529 Variant leads to less severe disease than Pango B and Delta variants strains in a mouse model of severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2020, the number of internet users surpassed 4.6 billion. Individuals who create and share digital data can leave a trail of information about their habits and preferences that collectively generate a digital footprint. Studies have shown that digital footprints can reveal important information regarding an individuals health status, ranging from diet and exercise to depression. Uses of digital applications have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic where public health organizations have utilized technology to reduce the burden of transmission, ultimately leading to policy discussions about digital health privacy. Though US consumers report feeling concerned about the way their personal data is used, they continue to use digital technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the extent to which consumers recognize possible health applications of their digital data and identify their most salient concerns around digital health privacy. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with a diverse national sample of US adults from November 2018 to January 2019. Participants were recruited from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, a nationally representative panel. Participants were asked to reflect on their own use of digital technology, rate various sources of digital information, and consider several hypothetical scenarios with varying sources and health-related applications of personal digital information. RESULTS: The final cohort included a diverse national sample of 45 US consumers. Participants were generally unaware what consumer digital data might reveal about their health. They also revealed limited knowledge of current data collection and aggregation practices. When responding to specific scenarios with health-related applications of data, they had difficulty weighing the benefits and harms but expressed a desire for privacy protection. They saw benefits in using digital data to improve health, but wanted limits to health programs use of consumer digital data. CONCLUSIONS: Current privacy restrictions on health-related data are premised on the notion that these data are derived only from medical encounters. Given that an increasing amount of health-related data is derived from digital footprints in consumer settings, our findings suggest the need for greater transparency of data collection and uses, and broader health privacy protections.","output":"Consumer Views on Health Applications of Consumer Digital Data and Health Privacy Among US Adults: Qualitative Interview Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The advent of electronic teaching facilities improves tutor-student communication. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of Phone-Based Audience Response System (PB-ARS), as an adjunctive pedagogy tool to enhance the retention of orthodontic information by dental students; and to explore the students perception of PB-ARS. METHODS: This cross-over clustered randomised control trial included 34 males who were in the final year of their undergraduate dental training. Participants were allocated to one of two event groups (G1 and G2) using computer-generated randomisation. Both groups simultaneously attended two different traditional lectures (L 1 and L2) a week apart. During L1, PB-ARS was used as an adjunct to conventional presentation to teach G1 participants, (PB-ARS group) while G2s participants acted as a control group (CG), and were taught using a traditional presentation. In the second week (L2), the interventions were crossed-over. Participants from both groups completed pre- and post-lecture multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQ) to assess their short-term retention of information. Their performance in the final MCQ exam (10 weeks following L2) was tracked to assess the long-term retention of the information. Participants also completed post-lecture questionnaires to evaluate their perceptions. RESULTS: Twenty-nine and 31 participants from the CG and PB-ARS group completed this trial, respectively. Although 87.5% of students in the PB-ARS group showed an improvement in their immediate post-lecture scores compared with 79.3% for the CG, it was statistically insignificant (p = 0.465). Similarly, the intervention showed an insignificant effect on the long-term retention of the knowledge (p = 0.560). There was a mildly but favourable attitude of students towards the use of PB-ARS. However, the difference in the overall level of satisfaction between both groups was statistically insignificant (p = 0.183). CONCLUSION: PB-ARS has a minimal and insignificant effect on the short- and long-term retention of orthodontic knowledge by male undergraduate dental students.

The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread. Methods We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics. Results Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17 to 20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23 to 24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei. Conclusions The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.","output":"First, second and potential third generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: an early exploratory study incorporating location-based service data of mobile devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be complicated with coagulopathy and high risk of thromboembolic events.

METHODS: We performed a one-year surveillance study (2010) of viral etiology causing ILI and investigated the influence of climate on outbreaks of ILI attributed to viruses at the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal Peoples Hospital in Zhuhai, China. RESULTS: Of the 337,272 outpatients who sought attention in the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal Peoples Hospital in 2010, 3,747 (1.11%) presented with ILI. Of these patients presenting with ILI, 24.66% (924/3,747) had available samples and were enrolled in this study. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 411 patients (44.48%) and 42 (4.55%) were co-infected with two viruses. In patients co-infected with two viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 50% (21/42). Among common viral pathogens detected, significant differences in age distributions were observed in seasonal influenza virus A (sFulA, H3N2) and B (sFluB), pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses (H1N1pdm09), RSV, and adenovirus (ADV).

We present a rare complication of nasoseptal flap (NSF) necrosis associated with COVID-19, further emphasizing the challenges of performing these procedures in this era. Case Description A 78-year-old male underwent an extended endoscopic endonasal transplanum resection of a pituitary macroadenoma for decompression of the optic chiasm. The resulting skull base defect was repaired using a pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF). The patient developed meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak on post-operative day thirteen requiring revision repair of the defect. Twelve days later, he developed persistent fevers and rhinorrhea. The patient was re-explored endoscopically, and the NSF was noted to be necrotic and devitalized with evident CSF leakage. At that time, the patient tested positive for Sars-CoV-2. Post-operatively, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and death.

Results show that trade duration of the agri-food imports is 12.07 months in China. However, 51.69% of disrupted trade relationships would resume after 2 months and 92.68% of temporarily interrupted trade relationships return to the market after 12 months. Empirical estimations show that global EPU has a larger impact on the stability of agricultural imports than Chinese EPU. Although Chinese EPU has heterogeneous effects on imports of different agri-food products in China, global EPU does not. Stabilized domestic food price and improved domestic agricultural productivity would improve stability of the imports significantly. The study concludes that Chinas agricultural imports are less dynamic than previous studies claimed. However, EPU significantly erodes the trade stability. To offset negative effects of EPU on the stability, government should pay more attention on stabilizing domestic food price volatility and increasing food productivity, and therefore improve food security in China.","output":"Does economic policy uncertainty undermine stability of agricultural imports?

We implemented a national, cross-sectional survey in the United States to examine the acceptability of a novel home-based peripheral blood collection device for HIV viral load testing. Between June and August 2021, we distributed an online survey to people with HIV (PWH) and community members, biomedical HIV cure researchers and HIV care providers. We performed descriptive analyses to summarize the results. We received 73 survey responses, with 51 from community members, 12 from biomedical HIV cure researchers and 10 from HIV care providers. Of those, 51 (70%) were cisgender men and 50 (68%) reported living with HIV. Most (>80% overall) indicated that the device would be helpful during ATI trials and they would feel comfortable using it themselves or recommending it to their patients/participants. Of the 50 PWH, 42 (84%) indicated they would use the device if they were participating in an ATI trial and 27 (54%) also expressed a willingness to use the device outside of HIV cure studies. Increasing sensitivity of viral load tests and pluri-potency of the device (CD4 count, chemistries) would augment acceptability. Survey findings provide evidence that viral load home testing would be an important adjunct to ongoing HIV cure-directed trials involving ATIs. Survey findings may help inform successful implementation and uptake of the device in the context of personalized HIV care.","output":"Preliminary Acceptability of a Home-Based Peripheral Blood Collection Device for Viral Load Testing in the Context of Analytical Treatment Interruptions in HIV Cure Trials: Results from a Nationwide Survey in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses, ranging from the common cold to severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The world's media focussed on the spread of this frightening new disease. It was portrayed as an almost unpredictable, random event, a quirk-or as a result of peculiar Chinese eating habits. Yet while the media focus changed from climate crisis to pandemic crisis, it is, nevertheless, the case that there is a link between the two. But both the climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic reveal our problematic relationship with nature. Specifically, they point to the way in which modern industrial capitalism is destroying our planet, our ecological system and creating the conditions for zoonotic transmission of deadly viruses and diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has its roots firmly in the way the present system prioritises profit over people's needs and their health. The crisis exposes a system that is destroying our planet and our ecosystem in the relentless drive to accumulate. It is time to put people and our natural world before profit.

The decision sought to protect vulnerable Israeli individuals who were either not vaccinated with IPV or who suffered from an immune deficiency, to preserve Israels status as a polio-free country, to prevent the virus exportation into vulnerable polio-free countries, and to participate in the global efforts toward the eradication of polio. After a massive public persuasion campaign, 79% of the children born after 2004 were vaccinated as well as 69% of the children residing in central Israel. A 2014 State Comptroller Report stated that the Ministry of Health should draw conclusions from the low compliance rates in certain Israeli regions. GOALS: The article seeks to examine the legal legitimacy of mandatory vaccination in the service of eradicating a contagious disease (as opposed to preventing a pandemic outbreak), which was one of the objectives in the 2013 Polio case. It more specifically relates to current Israeli law as well as to a hypothetical new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination and enforce this through the use of criminal sanctions. METHOD: Qualitative content analysis through the interpretation of court judgements, laws, legislative protocols, health ministry guidelines and documented discussions of the Advisory Committee on Infectious Diseases and Immunization. MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: A mandatory vaccination backed by criminal sanctions in the service of the eradication of contagious diseases would probably be perceived as infringing on the constitutional right to autonomy to a greater extent than necessary according to Israeli law and case law precedents. There may be some added value inherent in a new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination where nonrestrictive measures have been ineffective. However, the law should also specify a variety of sanctions to accompany the enforcement of mandatory vaccinations which would be formulated from least to most restrictive according to the intervention ladder concept. The law should also describe the circumstances which would justify the implementation of each and every sanction as well as the procedural safeguards designed for established decisions and fairness toward the individual(s) whose rights are infringed by the application of these sanctions.","output":"Would it be legally justified to impose vaccination in Israel?

Some patients with DM are diagnosed as diabetes gastroparesis and have several upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as appetite loss and abdominal pain. This study aimed to identify the relationship between gastric motility and upper GI symptoms in patients with long-standing DM. METHOD: This study was conducted among 23 patients with DM and 15 healthy controls. All the patients with DM were receiving insulin treatment and had at least one history of incidence of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy or neuropathy. Gastric motility was evaluated using electrogastrography (EGG) and gastric emptying using the 13C-acetic acid breath test. The most severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed in all patients. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, patients with long-standing DM showed a significantly lower percentage of normogastria at the postprandial state with a lower power ratio in EGG. Gastric emptying was significantly delayed in patients with DM in the overall analysis. Sixteen patients with DM (69.6%) demonstrated abnormalities in either gastric myoelectrical activity or gastric emptying. Among patients with abnormal EGG or delayed gastric emptying, 12 had some GI symptoms, compared with 3 patients with normal gastric motility. No significant correlation was observed between the gastric emptying parameters and HbA1c values. CONCLUSION: Patients with long-standing DM showed gastric dysmotility, including impaired gastric myoelectrical activity and delayed gastric emptying.

Disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with adverse health outcomes, but has not been extensively studied for the muscle disease sarcopenia. We aimed to determine the prevalence of probable sarcopenia, a precursor to sarcopenia diagnosis, based on the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) guidelines overall, and according to SEP. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 3342 community-dwelling older adults [mean age (SD) 68.9  6.3 years] from Wave 1 of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Probable sarcopenia was identified using gender-specific cut-off values for handgrip strength as recommended by EWGSOP2. SEP was defined by educational attainment. Multivariate regression analysis was employed to determine associations between probable sarcopenia and pre-defined risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, 23.4% of the population had probable sarcopenia and was significantly higher in the subset with low compared with high SEP (28.9% vs 18.1%, p<0.001). Consistent with this, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that disadvantaged SEP was a significant determinant of probable sarcopenia [OR, CI 1.48 (1.17, 1.87) p<0.001]. Other known risk factors, namely, increased age, low physical activity, comorbidity, and osteoarthritis were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of probable sarcopenia, while overweight/obesity appeared to be protective. CONCLUSION: Disadvantaged SEP was an independent determinant of probable sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults.

Therefore, the current major focus in China is to prevent the introduction of COVID into China from international arrivals. To achieve this, pre-Hospital COVID-19 Response Teams (pHCRTs) have been established. Context The pHRCTs were established in Xi'an, China in early 2020. During the 12 months covered in this report, there were 356 international flight arrivals with over 5,000 COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) positive people, 500 of them with symptomatic COVID-19 and requiring admission to special hospitals. All other arrivals were managed in dedicated facilities by pHRCTs. The outcome measure of this report was the number of positive cases among the pHRCT members. Details Four hundred forty-two staff worked in the pHCRTs during the reporting period. Despite multiple throat swab PCR tests during their pHRCTs tour of duty, and the subsequent mandatory 14-day quarantine required before return to the general community, no staff became NAT positive. Conclusion The prevention of community transmission from imported cases is a vital part of the strategy to maintain the low numbers of cases in countries which have achieved control, or suppression of local internal cases. The program of pHCRTs described in this article gives successful protocols for transportation of patients who are infectious based on the minimal transmission of virus and staff safety.

METHODS The authors used Pennsylvania Medicaid claims data from 2012 through 2017. They categorized dental procedures into 3 groups of pain (low, moderate, high). Using multivariable logistic regression models with random intercept, the authors estimated the probability of receiving an initial opioid prescription within 7 days before and 3 days after a dental procedure associated with the pain categories and assessed subsequent short- and long-term (4-90 days and 91-365 days, respectively) opioid use. RESULTS The authors identified 1,345,360 index dental procedures (among 912,121 enrollees), of which 67.6% were categorized as low pain, 1.6% as moderate pain, and 30.9% as high pain. Predicted probability of an initial opioid prescription was 2.4% (95% CI, 2.4% to 2.5%) for low-pain, 8.3% (95% CI, 7.9% to 8.6%) for moderate-pain, and 31.8% (95% CI, 31.6% to 31.9%) for high-pain procedures. Predicted probabilities for short-term use for those who did not fill versus those who did fill an opioid prescription were 0.9% (95% CI, 0.9% to 1.0%) versus 25.0% (95% CI, 24.5% to 25.6%) for the low-pain, 1.6% (95% CI, 1.4% to 1.8%) versus 16.6% (95% CI, 14.9% to 18.4%) for moderate-pain, and 2.9% (95% CI, 2.8% to 3.0%) versus 13.5% (95% CI, 13.3% to 13.7%) for the high-pain groups. CONCLUSIONS Although enrollees undergoing high-pain dental procedures were more likely to fill an initial opioid prescription than their counterparts with low- to moderate-pain procedures, the relative risk of experiencing sustained opioid use (4-90 days postprocedure) was highest in the low-pain group.

Submicron particulates FE was measured by particle transmission through face covering samples using a Condensation Particle Counter equipped with differential mobility analyzer and electronic manometer. Flow resistance of 0.1 m-diameter fluorescent nanoparticles in droplets was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity of residual collected at the reverse side of samples. The size-dependent FE (3C94%) and p (0.8C72 mmH2O) varied considerably among fabrics. Of the 16 mask types, 31.25% and 81.25% met the minimum FE and breathability standards in the ASTM F3502-21, respectively. Overall performance (qF) was highest for velcro masks (max qF = 3.36, min qF = 2.80) and lowest for Dutch wax print fabrics (max qF = 0.12, min qF = 0.03).

The fermentation pattern and the composition of the microbial population were also evaluated when operational variations were imposed (increase of substrate concentration or introduction of a second substrate). The experimental results demonstrated that at low and high pH values, a clearly different fermentation pattern was associated with the dominance of a specialised group of clostridiae.

We assessed family disruption and family functioning with measures of key family-level and parenting dimensions, including family cohesion, conflict and routines, and parents' harsh discipline, lax discipline and warmth. In all models, pre-pandemic parent emotional distress, financial strain and child maladjustment were included as covariates. METHODS: The sample included 204 families, comprised of parents who had children (MAge = 4.17; 45.1% girls). Parents (MAge = 27.43) completed the first survey prior to COVID-19 onset in the United States, a second survey after COVID-19 onset in May 2020 and a third survey two weeks later. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted in a model-building fashion, first computing structural equation models for each family and parenting dimension separately, then advancing significant dimensions into one integrated model for the family-level factors and a second model for parenting quality factors. Results provided more support for the family disruption hypothesis across all tests. In the family-level domain, decreases in family cohesion and increases in family conflict each uniquely predicted subsequent child maladjustment. In the parenting domain, increases in harsh discipline and lax discipline each uniquely predicted subsequent child maladjustment. Family routines and parental warmth were not associated with child adjustment. However, parents' emotional distress prior to the pandemic exhibited a robust association with children's internalizing problems.

As such, the present work aims to identify risk factors for mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19. Given that single-centre studies are less likely informative as elderly remains a minority in the total Chinese population, the present study reviewed the clinical data of geriatric COVID-19 patients gathered from different sources in the public domain. Based on the data of 154 individuals from 26 provinces, age remained a key mortality risk factor among geriatric patients of different ages. While dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort were more commonly seen in deceased patients as they represented severe pneumonia, fever was more prominent in surviving patients. This was likely due to the lower baseline body temperature observed in elderly which translated to a lower maximum temperature of fever. However, lowering the threshold temperature for fever is not recommended in surveillance. Instead, baseline body temperature measured on a regular basis should be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. Against mixed results, more research should be done on identifying comorbidities associated with mortality in geriatric patients.","output":"Risk factors for predicting mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19: a review of clinical data in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given an irregular dense tensor, how can we efficiently analyze it? An irregular tensor is a collection of matrices whose columns have the same size and rows have different sizes from each other. PARAFAC2 decomposition is a fundamental tool to deal with an irregular tensor in applications including phenotype discovery and trend analysis. Although several PARAFAC2 decomposition methods exist, their efficiency is limited for irregular dense tensors due to the expensive computations involved with the tensor. In this paper, we propose DPar2, a fast and scalable PARAFAC2 decomposition method for irregular dense tensors. DPar2 achieves high efficiency by effectively compressing each slice matrix of a given irregular tensor, careful reordering of computations with the compression results, and exploiting the irregularity of the tensor. Extensive experiments show that DPar2 is up to 6.0x faster than competitors on real-world irregular tensors while achieving comparable accuracy. In addition, DPar2 is scalable with respect to the tensor size and target rank.","output":"DPar2: Fast and Scalable PARAFAC2 Decomposition for Irregular Dense Tensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Netrin-1 was a laminin-related protein involved in neurovascular protection, and we previously discovered that decreased serum netrin-1 was associated with poor prognosis of ischemic stroke. However, the relationship between serum netrin-1 level and the risk of ischemic stroke remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between netrin-1 level and risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS A case-control study including 591 ischemic stroke patients and 591 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals was conducted, and serum netrin-1 concentrations were quantitatively determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for all participants. The serum netrin-1 levels were significantly lower in the ischemic stroke patients than those in matched controls (median, 496.4 vs 652.1 pg/mL; P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke associated with the highest quartile of netrin-1 was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.01-0.65; Ptrend = 0.018) compared with the lowest quartile of netrin-1. Each 1-standard deviation increase of log-transformed netrin-1 was associated with a lower odds of ischemic stroke (odds ratio: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.22-0.94; P = 0.032), and a dose-response relationship between serum netrin-1 and ischemic stroke was observed (Plinearity = 0.003). Incorporating netrin-1 to conventional risk factors improved the discriminatory power for ischemic stroke (net reclassification index = 98.0%, P < 0.001; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.28%, P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Serum netrin-1 was decreased in patients with ischemic stroke compared with healthy controls, suggesting that there was a potential role of netrin-1 in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.","output":"Decreased serum netrin-1 is associated with ischemic stroke: A case-control study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of college students job search and influencing factors has been an important topic in college students career development.

Hence, the current investigation was designed to compare diagnostic power of immuno-polymerase chain reaction (iPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods for detection of T. gondii IgG antibody. METHODS: Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against T. gondii were measured by the ELISA method in 81 participants. In addition, detection of acute and chronic toxoplasmosis was performed via the ELISA IgG avidity. The set-up of iPCR was carried out and then, serum IgG of subjects were detected using the iPCR method. RESULTS: Of 81 samples, 4 (4.9%) and 30 (37%) cases were be found positive for IgM and IgG against T. gondii in the ELISA method, respectively. Moreover, of 81 specimens, 42 (51.9%) and 39 (48.1%) samples had low-avidity IgG and high-avidity IgG by the IgG avidity kit, respectively. While, 59 (72.8%) of 81 samples were detected positive using the iPCR technique. Kappa () value coefficient, between the iPCR and ELISA (for IgG) showed a strong agreement (0.360, p value < 0.001).

We used telephone surveillance to estimate infection incidence and risk factors in women and newborns following hospital childbirth in Dar es Salaam. METHODS We recruited postnatal women from two tertiary hospitals and conducted telephone interviews 7 and 28 days after delivery. Maternal infection (endometritis, caesarean or perineal wound, or urinary tract infection) and newborn infection (umbilical cord or possible severe bacterial infection) were identified using hospital case-notes at the time of birth and self-reported symptoms. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to assess the association between potential risk-factors and infection. RESULTS We recruited 879 women and interviewed 791 (90%). From day 0-7, 6.7% (49/791) women and 6.2% (51/762) newborns developed infection. Using full follow-up data, the infection rate was higher in women with caesarean childbirth versus women with a vaginal delivery (aHR 1.93, 95%CI 1.11-3.36). Only 24% of women received pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis before caesarean section. Infection was higher in newborns resuscitated at birth versus newborns who were not resuscitated (aHR 4.45, 95%CI 2.10-9.44). At interview, 66% (37/56) of women and 88% (72/82) of newborns with possible infection had sought health-facility care. CONCLUSIONS Telephone surveillance identified a substantial risk of postnatal infection, including cases likely to have been missed by hospital-based data-collection alone. Risk of maternal endometritis and newborn possible severe bacterial infection were consistent with other studies. Caesarean section was the most important risk-factor for maternal infection.

In response to this challenge, The Lancet & Financial Times Commission Governing health futures 2030: Growing up in a digital world is exploring the convergence of digital health (DH), AI, and other frontier technologies with UHC to support attainment of SDG 3. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges, with serious implications for public health and healthcare systems worldwide. With online work and education having become the new norm, the COVID-19 pandemic has exponentially heightened the need to develop digital skills and literacy, while simultaneously revealing and exacerbating existing disparities in digital access and skills, thus widening existing digital divides. That being said, COVID-19 has accelerated the radical implementation and widespread adoption of digital technologies, providing opportunities for improved overall health and well-being outcomes, which may extend well into the future if appropriately and sustainably implemented, evaluated, and most importantly, governed. The findings and recommendations arising from the Commission's report, which will be presented and discussed, are fully aligned with this year's conference theme, Public health futures in a changing world. From the outset, the Commission framed its work through the notion that digital transformations, and the technologies that drive them, must be led by public value and governed to benefit population health and well-being. With growing investment in DH technologies in Europe, and increased recognition of governance challenges related to this field, this workshop offers an important and timely opportunity to present the Commission's work and discuss the implications of its findings and recommendations for European countries. The discussion in this workshop will centre around a set of critical questions, drawing from the experiences of experts involved in governance in the European context: Is the European DH ecosystem fit for purpose? To what extent is Europe's current legislative ecosystem and technical infrastructure capable of hosting digital transformations in health? Will the EHDS succeed in promoting citizens' control over their health data across Europe? How can national/regional approaches to governance of digital technologies and data better support public health outcomes and ensure that all Europeans can benefit from digital transformations in health and that no one is left behind? Workshop format: Opening remarks from each speaker to contextualise their work on DH governance in Europe and respond to the Commission's work (5 mins. each) Moderated roundtable discussion between panellists (15 mins.)

That indoleamine can affect the auto-, para- and endocrine pathways, regulating body functions and affecting the metabolism of animals and humans. In addition to the pineal gland, melatonin can be synthesized in many extra-pineal tissues, mainly in the gastrointestinal tract. Previous studies have shown that melatonin plays an important role in the defense system of the gastrointestinal mucosa, demonstrating a protective effect on the gastrointestinal tract and the acceleration of healing of chronic ulcers through the scavenging of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROS) and the activation of protective nitric oxide (NO) and vasodilator neuropeptides released from the sensory afferent neurons. The process of converting the melatonin precursor L-tryptophan into melatonin is already known, but not all aspects of this process for the synthesis of other metabolites of this pathway have been fully elucidated and this issue remains poorly understood. In this study, the conversion of L-tryptophan to melatonin and other metabolites was determined in gastric mucosa collected from rats with or without intragastric (i.g.) melatonin or L-tryptophan administration, both administered at a single dose of 50 mg/kg. For the determination of five metabolites of L-tryptophan: kynurenine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, anthranilic acid, indole-3-acetic acid together with melatonin, we have modified the previously developed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using a native fluorescence detection system and UV-VIS. The obtained results show that: 1) L-tryptophan is converted into melatonin in the gastric mucosa during the day, e.g. after eating a meal containing L-tryptophan, as it was imitated and confirmed by our study, in which this amino acid was administered directly to the stomach, 2) the gastric mucosa is capable of producing melatonin in much greater amounts than those recorded in the blood serum of rats given a single dose of L-tryptophan, and 3) apart from melatonin, the only serum levels of these five metabolites of the L-tryptophan metabolic pathway are detectable, while their level in the gastric mucosa is low and barely detectable under physiological conditions.

Cost data we presented as overall cost and cost-per-participant adjusted to 2017 US dollars. RESULTS: A total of 452 and 129 participants enrolled in fixed and mobile SSP services, respectively. The total cost associated with implementation and first year operations for the fixed site was $407,217.22 or $729.72 per participant and $311,625.52 or $2415.70 per participant for the mobile unit. The largest cost component for both modalities was time-dependent costs (personnel and overhead), while intervention materials (syringes, injection equipment, naloxone) were less than 15% of the total program cost. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Implementation and operation of new SSP models continue to be low cost compared to treatment for the multitude of harms PWID face without access to evidence-based prevention. Future cost-effectiveness and costCbenefit analyses integrating a comprehensive SSP model within an academic institution, including onsite wound care and other medical services, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of this model, and state-level policy action must be taken to lift the prohibition of state and local funds for the implementation, sustainability, and maintenance of these programs in Florida.","output":"Implementation and first-year operating costs of an academic medical center-based syringe services program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teleconsultation has assumed a central role in the management of chronic and disabling rheumatic diseases, such as the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), during COVID-19. However, the feasibility, challenges encountered, and outcomes remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe our teleconsultation experience in a prospectively followed cohort of adult and juvenile IIM. 250 IIM enrolled into the MyoCite cohort (2017-ongoing) were offered the option of audio/visual teleconsultation using WhatsApp during the nationwide lockdown. Clinical outcomes (major/minor relapse) and prescription changes were compared between IIM subsets. Socio-demographic and clinico-serological characteristics of those who sought teleconsultation were compared with those who did not. 151 teleconsultations were sought over a 93 day period by 71 (52.2%) of 136 IIM (median age 38 years, F:M 4.5:1). Nearly one-third (38%) consulted on an emergency basis, with voice consultations being the primary medium of communication. Over a quarter (26.8%) reported relapse (15.5% minor, 11.3% major), these being more common in JDM [71.4%, OR 8.9 (1.5-51)] as compared with adult IIM, but similar across various antibody-based IIM subtypes. Patients who relapsed required more consultations [2(2-3) vs 1(1-2), p 0.009]. The demographic and socioeconomic profile of the patients seeking consultation (n = 71) was not different from those who did not (n = 65). Voice-based teleconsultations may be useful to diagnose and manage relapses in IIM during the pandemic. Patient education for meticulous and timely reporting may be improve care, and larger multicentre studies may identify subsets of IIM that require greater care and early tele-triage for effective management of the condition.","output":"Teleconsultation experience with the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: a prospective observational cohort study during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of admitted COVID-19 patients in a Danish hospital setting where an early active government intervention was taken.

Many such viral vector vaccines are now at various stages of clinical evaluation. Here, we introduce an attenuated form of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a potential chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1, with implications for use as a vaccine vector for other pathogens. The rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vector was attenuated by combining two major genome modifications. These modifications acted synergistically to greatly enhance vector attenuation and the resulting rVSV vector demonstrated safety in sensitive mouse and non-human primate neurovirulence models. This vector expressing HIV-1 gag protein has completed evaluation in two Phase I clinical trials. In one trial the rVSV/HIV-1 vector was administered in a homologous two-dose regimen, and in a second trial with pDNA in a heterologous prime boost regimen. No serious adverse events were reported nor was vector detected in blood, urine or saliva post vaccination in either trial. Gag specific immune responses were induced in both trials with highest frequency T cell responses detected in the prime boost regimen. The rVSV/HIV-1 vector also demonstrated safety in an ongoing Phase I trial in HIV-1 positive participants. Additionally, clinical trial material has been produced with the rVSV vector expressing HIV-1 env, and Phase I clinical evaluation will initiate in the beginning of 2016. In this paper, we use a standardized template describing key characteristics of the novel rVSV vaccine vectors, in comparison to wild type VSV. The template facilitates scientific discourse among key stakeholders by increasing transparency and comparability of information.

Using PHI-BLAST and the viral protease cleavage site sequences, we searched the human proteome for host targets and analyzed the hit results. Although the polyprotein and host proteins related to the suppression of the innate immune responses may be the primary targets of these viral proteases, we identified other cleavable host proteins. These proteins appear to be related to the virus-induced phenotype associated with Group IV viruses, suggesting that information about viral pathogenesis may be extractable directly from the viral genome sequence.

These patients were tested in the non-acute exacerbation period and the acute exacerbation period, so they were defined as AECOPD group and Non-AECOPD group. Besides, 50 healthy subjects were recruited and defined as control group. Total plasma Hcy levels (antibodies-online, USA) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between serum Hcy level and ventilatory function. Using ROC curve, the diagnostic value of Hcy for the occurrence and acute progression of COPD was explored. RESULTS: In this study, we found that Hcy levels in the Non-AECOPD group or the AECOPD group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, compared with the Non-AECOPD group, the Hcy level in the AECOPD group was significantly higher (P < 0.001). In addition, according to the classification of GOLD grade, there was significant difference in the Hcy level among different GOLD grade groups (P < 0.001). The correlation analysis showed that in the AECOPD group and the Non-AECOPD group, Hcy levels presented a negative correlation with FEV1(r < 0). Meanwhile, FEV1% was also negatively correlated with Hcy level (r < 0). ROC curve analysis showed that when the cutoff value was set to 10.8 g/ml, the specificity, sensitivity and AUC were the best, which were 0.980, 0.800, and 0.945, respectively. Besides, our results showed that when the cutoff value was set to 14.0 g / ml, the specificity, sensitivity and AUC were the best, which were 0.846, 0.680, and 0.802, respectively.

METHODS First, we discuss about the psychological and neuronal features of self and and self-other relation and how they are rooted in a deeper layer of the brain's neural activity complemeting its cognitive surface layer. Secondly, we demonstrate cultural differences of eastern and western concepts of self, i.e., independency and inter-dependency, and how these reflect the manifestation of the brain's neuro-social and -ecological alignment. Finally, we highlight how inter-subjective and cultural nature of self surface in the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS Discussing various lines of empirical data showing the brain's intimate alignment to both social and ecological environmental contexts our results support the assumption of the brain's deep layer features by laying bare a continuum of different degrees of neuro-social and neuro-ecological alignment. This entails a a two-stage model of self with neuro-social-ecological and psychological levels that extends the previously suggested basis model of self-specificity (BMSS). CONCLUSION We conclude that the current pandemic shows the importance of the deeper inter-subjective and cultural layers of both self and brain; their neglect can be life-threatening for self and others and, paradoxically, might reduce, rather than enlarge, the self's sense of freedom and independence.

In addition, the numbers of diabetics are rising, along with its most common complication, diabetic retinopathy (DR). To effectively treat DR within the elderly population, it is essential first to consider the retinal changes that occur due to aging, such as decreased blood flow, retinal thinning, and microglial changes, and understand that these changes can render the retina more vulnerable to oxidative and ischemic damage. Given these considerations, as well as the pathogenesis of DR, specific pathways could play a heightened role in DR progression in elderly patients, such as the polyol pathway and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) axis. Current ocular treatments include intravitreal corticosteroids, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, laser photocoagulation and surgical interventions, in addition to better control of underlying diabetes with an expanding range of systemic treatments. While using therapeutics, it is also essential to consider how pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics change with aging; oral drug absorption can decrease, and ocular drug metabolism might affect the dosing and delivery methods. Also, elderly patients may more likely be nonadherent to their medication regimen or appointments than younger patients, and undertreatment with anti-VEGF drugs often leads to suboptimal outcomes. With a rising number of elderly DR patients, understanding how aging affects disease progression, pharmacological metabolism, and adherence are crucial to ensuring that this population receives adequate care.","output":"Diabetic Retinopathy in the Aging Population: A Perspective of Pathogenesis and Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The twentieth anniversary of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides a timely opportunity to revisit the fundamentalisation of social rights in the European legal system.

Patients and methods Individuals 18 years and older who died from COVID-19 and had an autopsy performed at Mayo Clinic between April 2020 to October 2020 were included. Morphological evaluation of the kidneys of 17 individuals with COVID-19 was performed. In a subset of 7 COVID-19 cases with post-mortem interval of 20 hours, ultrastructural and molecular characteristics (targeted transcriptome & proteomics analyses of tubulointerstitium) were evaluated. Molecular characteristics were compared to archived cases of S-AKI and non-sepsis causes of AKI (NS-AKI). Results The spectrum of COVID-19 renal pathology included macrophage dominant microvascular inflammation (glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis), vascular dysfunction (peritubular capillary congestion & endothelial injury), tubular injury with ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial damage. Investigation of the spatial architecture using a novel imaging mass cytometry revealed enrichment of CD3+CD4+ T cells in close proximity to antigen-presenting cells, and macrophage-enriched glomerular and interstitial infiltrates, suggesting an innate and adaptive immune tissue response. COVID-19 AKI and S-AKI, as compared to NS-AKI, had an enrichment of transcriptional pathways involved in inflammation (apoptosis, autophagy, MHC class I and II, and Th1 differentiation). Proteomic pathway analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 AKI & to a lesser extent S-AKI was enriched in necroptosis and sirtuin signaling pathways, both involved in regulatory response to inflammation. Upregulation of ceramide signaling pathway and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in COVID-19 AKI was noted. Conclusions This data highlights the similarities between S-AKI and COVID-19 AKI and suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a pivotal role in COVID-19 AKI.

IBV causes substantial worldwide economic losses in the poultry industry. Vaccination with live-attenuated viral vaccines, therefore, are of critical importance. Live-attenuated viral vaccines, however, exhibit the potential for reversion to virulence and recombination with virulent field strains. Therefore, alternatives such as subunit vaccines are needed together with the identification of suitable adjuvants, as subunit vaccines are less immunogenic than live-attenuated vaccines. Several glycan-based adjuvants directly targeting mammalian C-type lectin receptors were assessed in vitro using chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs). The -1-6-glucan, pustulan, induced an up-regulation of MHC class II (MHCII) cell surface expression, potentiated a strong proinflammatory cytokine response, and increased endocytosis in a cation-dependent manner. Ex vivo co-culture of peripheral blood monocytes from IBV-immunised chickens, and BM-DCs pulsed with pustulan-adjuvanted recombinant IBV N protein (rN), induced a strong recall response. Pustulan-adjuvanted rN induced a significantly higher CD4 +blast percentage compared to either rN, pustulan or media. However, the CD8 +and TCRæ +blast percentage were significantly lower with pustulan-adjuvanted rN compared to pustulan or media. Thus, pustulan enhanced the efficacy of MHCII antigen presentation, but apparently not the cross-presentation on MHCI. In conclusion, we found an immunopotentiating effect of pustulan in vitro using chicken BM-DCs. Thus, future in vivo studies might show pustulan as a promising glycan-based adjuvant for use in the poultry industry to contain the spread of coronaviridiae as well as of other avian viral pathogens.","output":"Pustulan activates chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in vitro and promotes ex vivo cd4 +t cell recall response to infectious bronchitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza is a burden for emergency departments (ED).

METHODS: Using a cross\\\\over design, the cobas? Liat? Influenza A/B POC PCR test (Liat) was compared with standard clinical practice during the 2019/2020 influenza season. All adult patients (aged  18 years) with fever (38C) and respiratory symptoms were included. Primary end points were the prevalence of influenza infections in the ED and staff sick days. Secondary end points were frequency of antiviral and antibacterial therapy, time between admission and test result or treatment initiation, patient disposition, ED length of stay (LOS), and for inpatients mortality and LOS. Nurses were interviewed about handling and integration of POC testing. The occurrence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infections coincided with the second half of the study. RESULTS: A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study. All 375 patients of the intervention group were tested with Liat, and 103 patients of them (27.6%) tested positive. During the intervention period, staff sick days were reduced by 34.4% (P = .023). Significantly, more patients in the intervention group received antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors (7.2% vs 3.8%, P = .028) and tested patients received antibiotics more frequently (40.0% vs 31.6%, P = .033).

In a substantial number of patients, adequate arterial oxygenation cannot be achieved with supplementary oxygen therapy alone. To date, there has been no clear guideline endorsement of ward-based non-invasive pressure support (NIPS) for severely hypoxic patients who are deemed unlikely to benefit from invasive ventilation. We established a ward-based NIPS service for COVID-19 PCR-positive patients, with severe hypoxia, and in whom escalation to critical care for invasive ventilation was not deemed appropriate. A retrospective analysis of survival in these patients was undertaken. Twenty-eight patients were included. Ward-based NIPS for severe hypoxia was associated with a 50% survival in this cohort. This compares favourably with Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre survival data following invasive ventilation in a less frail, less comorbid and younger population. These results suggest that ward-based NIPS should be considered as a treatment option in an integrated escalation strategy in all units managing respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.","output":"Improved survival following ward-based non-invasive pressure support for severe hypoxia in a cohort of frail patients with COVID-19: retrospective analysis from a UK teaching hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mediatised circulation of narratives that invite or induce strong emotional responses has been a key dimension of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the efficacy of telemedicine for follow-up management after liver transplantation. METHODS: To determine the efficacy of telemedicine for follow-up after liver transplantation, we performed a clinical observation cohort study to evaluate the rate of recovery, readmission rate within 30 days after discharge, mortality, and morbidity. Patients (n=110) who underwent liver transplantation (with livers from organ donation after citizen's death) were randomly assigned to receive either telemedicine-based follow-up management for 2 weeks in addition to the usual care or usual care follow-up only. Patients in the telemedicine group were given a robot free-of-charge for 2 weeks of follow-up. Using the robot, patients interacted daily, for approximately 20 minutes, with transplant specialists who assessed respiratory rate, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and blood glucose level; asked patients about immunosuppressant medication use, diet, sleep, gastrointestinal function, exercise, and T-tube drainage; and recommended rehabilitation exercises. RESULTS: No differences were detected between patients in the telemedicine group (n=52) and those in the usual care group (n=50) regarding age (P=.17), the model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD, P=.14), operation time (P=.51), blood loss (P=.07), and transfusion volume (P=.13). The length and expenses of the initial hospitalization (P=.03 and P=.049) were lower in the telemedicine group than they were in the usual care follow-up group. The number of patients with MELD score 30 before liver transplantation was greater in the usual care follow-up group than that in the telemedicine group. Furthermore, the readmission rate within 30 days after discharge was markedly lower in the telemedicine group than in the usual care follow-up group (P=.02). The postoperative survival rates at 12 months in the telemedicine group and the usual care follow-up group were 94.2% and 90.0% (P=.65), respectively. Warning signs of complications were detected early and treated in time in the telemedicine group. Furthermore, no significant difference was detected in the long-term visit cumulative survival rate between the two groups (P=.50). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid recovery and markedly lower readmission rates within 30 days after discharge were evident for telemedicine follow-up management of patients postCliver transplantation, which might be due to high-efficiency in perioperative and follow-up management. Moreover, telemedicine follow-up management promotes the self-management and medication adherence, which improves patients health-related quality of life and facilitates achieving optimal clinical outcomes in postCliver transplantation.","output":"Telemedicine for Follow-up Management of Patients After Liver Transplantation: Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly develop respiratory failure or even die, underscoring the need for early identification of patients at elevated risk of severe illness. This study aims to quantify pneumonia lesions by computed tomography (CT) in the early days to predict progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, representing the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV) in both lungs. CT features, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and d-dimer, on day 0 (hospital admission) and day 4, were collected to predict the occurrence of severe illness within a 28-day follow-up using both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We included 134 patients, of whom 19 (14.2%) developed any severe illness. CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, showed predictive capability. Changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed the best in the prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87~0.99; C-index=0.88, 95% CI 0.81~0.95). The hazard ratios of PGV and PCV were 1.39 (95% CI 1.05~1.84, P=0.023) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.17~2.38, P=0.005), respectively. CT features, adjusted for age and gender, on day 4 and in terms of changes from day 0 to day 4 outperformed APACHE-II, NLR, and d-dimer.

Even interventions with minor antiviral effect may reduce host exposure if timed correctly. Ivermectin seems to be at least partially effective: given on positivity, peak viral load dropped by 0.3-0.6 log units and exposure by 8.8-22.3%. The other drugs had little to no appreciable effect.

These rumors adversely affect peoples physical and mental health. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between public emotions and rumors during the epidemic may help generate useful strategies for guiding public emotions and dispelling rumors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether public emotions are related to the dissemination of online rumors in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: We used the web-crawling tool Scrapy to gather data published by Peoples Daily on Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China, after January 8, 2020. Netizens comments under each Weibo post were collected. Nearly 1 million comments thus collected were divided into 5 categories: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and neutral, based on the underlying emotional information identified and extracted from the comments by using a manual identification process. Data on rumors spread online were collected through Tencents Jiaozhen platform. Time-lagged cross-correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between public emotions and rumors. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the angrier the public felt, the more rumors there would likely be (r=0.48, P<.001). Similar results were observed for the relationship between fear and rumors (r=0.51, P<.001) and between sadness and rumors (r=0.47, P<.001). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between happiness and rumors, with happiness lagging the emergence of rumors by 1 day (r=0.56, P<.001). In addition, our data showed a significant positive correlation between fear and fearful rumors (r=0.34, P=.02).

We have developed kinase translocation reporters (KTRs), which enable multiplexed measurements of the dynamics of kinase activity at a single-cell level. These KTRs are composed of an engineered construct in which a kinase substrate is fused to a bipartite nuclear localization signal (bNLS) and nuclear export signal (NES), as well as to a fluorescent protein for microscopy-based detection of its localization. The negative charge introduced by phosphorylation of the substrate is used to directly modulate nuclear import and export, thereby regulating the reporter's distribution between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The relative cytoplasmic versus nuclear fluorescence of the KTR construct (the C/N ratio) is used as a proxy for the kinase activity in living, single cells. Multiple KTRs can be studied in the same cell by fusing them to different fluorescent proteins. Here, we present a protocol to execute and analyze live-cell microscopy experiments using KTRs. We describe strategies for development of new KTRs and procedures for lentiviral expression of KTRs in a cell line of choice.

The authors present a regional-based model of a network of clinicians and healthcare managers using a dedicated IT platform to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency objectives, to ensure coordination of the available resources and the most appropriate rehabilitative treatment for patients. The proposed post-acute COVID-19 rehabilitation network has been designed according to the model of a clinical management project within the Italian national healthcare system, and its context is an easily adjustable model for the European healthcare systems. The authors base the project on current laws and scientific guidelines in rehabilitation in Italy and in Europe and use the SWOT analysis technique to assess the proposal feasibility. The primary aims of the project are: (1) standardizing the minimum assessment tools of post-COVID-19 patients with disabilities; (2) ensuring an individual rehabilitation project for each patient with international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF) coding and (3) reporting the activity performance with appropriate indicators. The secondary aims are: (1) developing educational programs for patients and care givers also aimed at acquiring better empowerment and positive behavior; (2) creating a regional database for data collection and (3) improving IT, and specifically tele-rehabilitation, as a suitable approach during the COVID-19 emergency and also in the future. Expected results are: continuum of care; effectiveness, efficacy and appropriateness in the delivery of rehabilitation treatments through a standardized minimum assessment and the wording of the individual rehabilitation project and a precise reporting of performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of clinical activities and the satisfaction of patients and caregivers. The assessment of results will be analyzed at three and six months to implement corrective actions according to the concept of continuous improvement of the Deming cycle.

As examples, we develop three hypotheses: (1) a multicellular signaling cascade among alternatively differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages whose tasks include T cell recruitment and activation; (2) novel platelet subtypes with drastically modulated expression of genes responsible for adhesion, coagulation and thrombosis; (3) a multilineage cell activator network able to drive extrafollicular B maturation via an ensemble of genes extensively associated with risk for developing autoimmunity.","output":"A Web Portal and Workbench for Biological Dissection of Single Cell COVID-19 Host Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also called broken heart syndrome, is an acute and transient cardiac wall motion abnormality of the left ventricle. The patient prototype is a post-menopausal woman with myocardial infarction-like symptoms (angina pectoris, breathlessness, palpitations, etc.) who has experienced sudden emotional or physical stress. Although prognosis is generally considered relatively benign, both complications and recurrence rates are not insignificant. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TTS are not entirely understood, but the sympathetic system over-activity has a leading role. Moreover, since emotional stress frequently triggers TTS and since precedent diagnosis of psychiatric disorders sometimes coexists, the psychological response to stress could be another potential therapeutic target. Indeed, this article aims to explore the association between underlying depression and anxiety disorders and TTS, as well as to find ideal therapeutic options useful to treat and prevent TTS. Thus in our review, we considered case reports, case-control studies, and review articles from PubMed. Papers dealing with Takotsubo syndrome and anxiety disorder or depression were selected. We included papers published since 2010 and whose abstract was in English. We concluded that anxiety disorders, but not depression, are associated with a higher occurrence of TTS. There is a link between anxiety, TTS, and inflammation leading to increased sympathetic activity. Nevertheless, patients with pre-admission psychiatric disorders have a higher risk of recurrent TTS. Importantly, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) could be a potential therapeutic aid in preventing TTS's recurrence in selected patients.","output":"Role of Depression and Anxiety Disorders in Takotsubo Syndrome: The Psychiatric Side of Broken Heart"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to examine whether low intensive care unit (ICU) admission 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia. This was a prospective observational study of SARS-CoV2 positive critically ill patients treated in a multidisciplinary ICU. Thirty (30) Greek patients were included, in whom 25(OH)D was measured on ICU admission. Eighty (80%) percent of patients had vitamin D deficiency, and the remaining insufficiency. Based on 25(OH)D levels, patients were stratified in two groups: higher and lower than the median value of the cohort (15.2 ng/mL). The two groups did not differ in their demographic or clinical characteristics. All patients who died within 28 days belonged to the low vitamin D group. Survival analysis showed that the low vitamin D group had a higher 28-day survival absence probability (log-rank test, p = 0.01). Critically ill COVID-19 patients who died in the ICU within 28 days appeared to have lower ICU admission 25(OH)D levels compared to survivors. When the cohort was divided at the median 25(OH)D value, the low vitamin D group had an increased risk of 28-day mortality. It seems plausible, therefore, that low 25(OH)D levels may predispose COVID-19 patients to an increased 28-day mortality risk.","output":"Low 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels on Admission to the Intensive Care Unit May Predispose COVID-19 Pneumonia Patients to a Higher 28-Day Mortality Risk: A Pilot Study on a Greek ICU Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: : Worldwide the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the health and psychosocial lives of people. International guidelines recommend special attention to pregnant women during pandemics and national emergencies. This study aimed to report the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic curfew on the psychosocial lives of pregnant women in Jordan. DESIGN: : A cross-sectional study was conducted and included women who were pregnant during the COVID-19 curfew in Jordan, which took place between mid-March and mid-June of 2020. SETTINGS: : A web-based survey that was posted on various social media platforms. PARTICIPANTS: : Women who at the time of the study were 18 years of age or more, were living in Jordan, and were pregnant during the curfew. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: : Data collected included women's characteristics, the impact of the curfew on the pregnancy, physical activity, and psychosocial lives and the barriers to seeking healthcare, in addition to pregnancy and delivery details, and changes in nutrition and supplements intake. A total of 877 women responded to the survey. The results showed that 21.1% of the respondents did not receive any antenatal care (ANC) during the curfew. The respondents also reported that the main barriers for seeking ANC included healthcare facilities being closed (85.2%), the need for travel permits (76.8%), financial difficulties (63.9%), and fear of catching the COVID-19 virus (60.1%). Furthermore, 93.3% reported that they had psychological stress, and 29.9% reported that they had at least one form of domestic violence. Statistically significant associations existed between various women's characteristics, obstetric, psychosocial factors, and the level of psychological stress. KEY CONCLUSIONS: : The COVID-19 pandemic curfew, which was applied in Jordan, resulted in a negative impact on the psychosocial lives of pregnant women. As a result, pregnant women did not receive optimal antenatal care and experienced higher degrees of psychological stress and domestic violence. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: : The findings of our study may encourage national healthcare policymakers to ensure the provision of appropriate psychosocial support of pregnant women during large scale emergencies.","output":"The Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic Curfew on the Psychosocial Lives of Pregnant Women in Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: The simplified interpretation of serum ferritin levels, according to which low ferritin levels indicate iron deficiency and high levels indicate hemochromatosis is obsolete, as in the presence of inflammation serum ferritin levels, no longer correlate with iron stores. However, further data are needed to interpret serum ferritin levels correctly in patients with ongoing inflammation. Our study aimed to assess serum iron and ferritin dynamics in patients with long intensive care unit (ICU) stay and the possible correlations with organ dysfunction progression and outcome. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective study in a university hospital ICU over six months. All patients with an ICU length-of-stay of more than seven days were enrolled. Collected data included: demographics, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, admission, weekly serum iron and ferritin levels, ICU length-of-stay and outcome. Interactions between organ dysfunction progression and serum iron and ferritin levels changes were investigated. Outcome predictive value of serum ferritin was assessed. Results: Seventy-two patients with a mean ICU length-of-stay of 15 (4.4) days were enrolled in the study. The average age of patients was 62 (16.8) years. There were no significant differences between survivors (39 patients, 54%) and nonsurvivors (33 patients, 46%) regarding demographics, serum iron and ferritin levels and SOFA score on ICU admission. Over time, serum iron levels remained normal or low, while serum ferritin levels statedly increased in all patients. Serum ferritin increase was higher in nonsurvivors than survivors. There was a significant positive correlation between SOFA score and serum ferritin (r = 0.7, 95% CI for r = 0.64 to 0.76, p < 0.01). The predictive outcome accuracy of serum ferritin was similar to the SOFA score.

Hitherto, the genetics of tear duct development and obstruction has been scarcely explored, and related animal models are lacking. This study aims to study the potential role of the Wnt/PCP pathway mediated by Prickle 1 in tear duct development and diseases. Methods A severe hypomorphic Prickle 1 mutant was generated. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to compare wild type, Prickle 1 hypomorphic, and null mutant tear ducts. In situ hybridization was conducted to identify the signaling components in the developing tear ducts. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was used to detect the human embryonic tear duct. Results Here, we report that a severe Prickle 1 hypomorph mouse line exhibited epiphora. This phenotype was due to the blockage of the tear drainage by incompletely formed nasolacrimal duct (NLD) and lacrimal canaliculi (LC), which also causes precocious eyelid opening. We observed a dose-dependent requirement of Prickle 1 for tear duct outgrowth. An investigation of the expression of Wnt/PCP core genes demonstrated a subset of PCP signaling components expressed in the developing tear duct. Furthermore, Prickle 1 is not required for the expression of Fgfr2/Fgf10 and p63 genes, which are associated with the NLD and LC hypoplasia in humans. Last, we showed that Prickle 1 expression in the developing tear drainage system is conserved between mice and humans.

In this work we aimed to evaluate a possible association between the severity of clinical manifestations and viral load over time during the epidemiological transition from high-to low-transmission settings. METHODS: We reviewed the cases of COVID-19 diagnosed at the emergency room of our hospital, retrieving the proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit. A raw estimation of the viral load was done evaluating the Ct (cycle threshold) trend obtained from our diagnostic reverse transcriptase real-time PCR test. RESULTS: The proportion of patients requiring intensive care significantly decreased from 6.7% (19/281) in March to 1.1% (1/86) in April, and to none in May (Fisher's test p 0.0067). As for viral load, we observed a trend of Ct increasing from a median value of 24 (IQR 19-29) to 34 (IQR 29-37) between March and May, with a statistically significant difference between March and April (pairwise Wilcoxon test with stepdown Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing, p 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a reduction over time in the proportion of patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, along with decreasing median values of viral load.

Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: : Three open-access social media forums (Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically searched with respect to COVID-19-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of individuals. The data was retrieved in the first three weeks of March 2020. Qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis were used as the methodical approach. The data was reviewed by all authors and jointly interpreted to minimise inconsistencies. Results: : The study reveals that reasons such as information pollution on social media, the persistence of uncertainty about the rapidly spreading virus, the impact of the social environment on the individual, and fear of unemployment associated with inequality in the distribution of income lead people to ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities. The findings suggest that government representatives and politicians could not produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak, due to not building trust among the public and taking concrete economic steps to satisfy them. Conclusion: In uncertain crises, transparency in the presentation of information and government policies emerge as influential determinants in creating social susceptibility and solidarity. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the necessary steps to be undertaken in times of crisis.","output":"Lay perspectives on social distancing and other official recommendations and regulations in the time of COVID-19: a qualitative study of social media posts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was formerly called as 2019 Novel Corona Virus[1] is a breath taking disease. It had its impact on millions of lives across the world. At present, as of March 2021, the rate of infection has declined throughout different parts of the world [2]. But it has been warned by scientists that this deadly disease can have its second wave over a period of time. Also, there is a possibility of this covid-19 to become a seasonal disease [3]. In such case, premature diagnosis of this virus is essential in order to save many lives. A kit called RT-PCR has been employed to detect the presence of this virus [4]. However, this method of prognosis takes time depending on the locality of the infected person [5]. This leads to the proliferation of the infection. Hence, an alternate procedure should be unearthed, which diagnose this disease within a short span of time. In this paper, a Deep Learning concept has been proposed which aids the timely detection of the corona virus infection.

Indicated preventive interventions to target individuals with subclinical symptoms to prevent the transition to clinical levels of disorders have gained considerable traction. However, the threshold to seek help appears to be high even when help is needed. Online interventions could offer a solution, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping review will present an overview of the recent research of indicated online preventive interventions for youth (12C25 years) experiencing the early stages of mental health complaints with the aim of identifying the nature and extent of the research evidence. Methods: The 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley was used. Academic literature published from 2013 onwards in printed or electronic format was included from Scopus, PsychINFO, and Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL. Results: The search yielded 11,122 results, with the final selection resulting in inclusion of 30 articles for this review. In total, the articles included 4,950 participants. 26.7% of the selected articles focused on youth between 12 and 25 years. Of the articles 60% did not screen for, nor exclude participants with clinical levels of symptoms. Most studies used a common evidence-based therapy for the disorder-category targeted. More than half of the online interventions included some form of human support. Adherence levels ranged between 27.9 and 98%. The results indicate general effectiveness, usability and acceptability of online indicated preventive interventions. The most commonly used approach was CBT (n = 12 studies). Studies varied in their size, rigor of study, effectiveness and outcome measures. Online interventions with a combination of clinical and peer moderation (n = 3 studies) appear to result in the most stable and highest effect sizes. Conclusion: Online indicated preventive mental health interventions for youth with emerging mental health issues show promise in reducing various mental health complaints, and increasing positive mental health indicators such as well-being and resilience. Additionally, high levels of usability and acceptability were found. However, the included studies show important methodological shortcomings. Also, the research has mainly focused on specific diagnostic categories, meaning there is a lack of transdiagnostic approaches.

The Speech-Language Therapy (SLT) team was monitoring twenty-five users when the first cases of COVID-19 were notified in southern Brazil. Of these, it was judged that twelve patients required at least a monitoring call every two weeks. Teleconsultations were available in this first stage, on an emergency basis, during the implementation of the project in this format. The idea was to guarantee, due to the suspension of the SLT sessions, the maintenance of the care service for patients who could suffer worsening of their cases or even comorbidities. The appointments were carried out by video calls by SLT students, therapists of the extension project, and supervised by a speech-language therapist, synchronously. All conversations and orientations during the teleconsultation were conducted as calmly as possible and, in the case of infant patients, permeated by some playful activities. Telehealth has shown to be an efficient resource for the care of patients with SLT demands, enabling remote care with the same quality as face-to-face care. Besides, it has relevant potential, once there is a significant number of patients, who need SLT assessment and live in regions where there is a shortage of qualified professionals.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of telehealth in speech-language and hearing therapy for patients at home: an experience report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improvement in survival rates of low birth-weight infants particularly in the neonatal intensive care units of India appears to be accompanied by frequent recognition of Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among early survivors.

A system dynamic model was developed to investigate interactions between household water use behaviors (toilet flushing, clothes washing, bathing/showering, and cleaning) and associated greenhouse gas emissions and environmental costs. Six hundred and fifty face-to-face interviews were conducted in 12 districts of Taipei. The results showed that the respondents individual attributes were not significantly related to water use behaviors. The highest volume of water was used for cleaning (27.7 %), followed by clothes washing (26.2 %), bathing/showering (26.1 %), and toilet flushing (20.0 %). Five water management scenarios with 5 %C20 % reductions in water volume from different water use behaviors were simulated. The maximum reduction in water use (6.27 t) was found in the fifth scenario (20 % reduction), which reflected the priority the respondents gave to save water if its price increased. 27.2 % of respondents had water saving appliances; 20.5 % and 16.4 % of the appliances were toilets and shower heads, respectively. The environmental cost of GHG emissions associated with water use behavior was US$0.001/t, causing an 8% increase in water price.

From March until late April, the number of cases increased exponentially. The delivery of anti-cancer therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic was extremely challenging. In order to balance the benefits of continuing anti-cancer therapy with the associated increased hospital visits, combined with the risk of COVID-19 infection, we undertook a series of system changes in the delivery of cancer care. METHODS: Patients who attended our dayward over a 4-month period were included. Data were obtained from patient and chemotherapy prescribing records. Patients were screened for symptoms of COVID-19 at two separate timepoints: prior to their visit via telephone, and using a symptom questionnaire on arrival at the hospital. If patients displayed COVID-19 symptoms, they were isolated and a viral swab arranged. RESULTS: A total of 456 patients attended from January 1st to April 30th. The numbers of visits from January to April were 601, 586, 575, and 607, respectively. During this period, there were 2369 patient visits to the dayward and 1953 (82%) intravenous regimens administered. Of the 416 visits that did not lead to treatment, 114 (27%) were scheduled non-treatment review visits, 194 (47%) treatments were held due to disease-related illness, and 108 (26%) treatments were held due to treatment-related complications. Screening measurements were implemented on March 18th due to rising COVID-19 prevalence in the general population. Overall, 53 treatments were held due to the screening process: 19 patients (36%) elicited COVID-19 symptoms via telephone screening; 34 patients (64%) were symptomatic in our pre-assessment area and referred for swabs, of which 4 were positive. Those with a negative swab were rescheduled for chemotherapy the following week.

Examining risk factors for prolonged viral shedding may provide critical insight for the development of novel therapeutics and help inform infection prevention practices. Our objective was to identify risk factors for prolonged shedding of HRV post-HCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected weekly nasal samples from allogeneic HCT recipients from day 0 to day 100 post-transplant, and performed realtime RT-PCR (12/2005 to 2/2010). Subjects with symptomatic HRV infection and a negative test within 2 weeks of the last positive were included. Duration of shedding was defined as time between the first positive and first negative samples. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were used as a proxy for viral load. HRV species were identified by sequencing the 5 non-coding region. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors associated with prolonged shedding (21 days). RESULTS: We identified 38 HCT recipients with HRV infection fulfilling study criteria (32 adults, 6 children). Median duration of shedding was 9.5 days (2-89 days); 18 patients had prolonged shedding. Among 26 samples sequenced, 69% were species A, and species B and C accounted for 15% each; the median shedding duration of HRV did not differ between species (P = 0.17). Bivariable logistic regression analyses suggest that initial high viral load (low Ct value) is associated with prolonged shedding.

Variable manifestations characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the design and production of effective vaccines and their considerable effect on reducing the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rate, no definitive cure for the disease has yet been found. Mutations may also affect the effectiveness of vaccines. The host immune response to the pathogen has a critical role in the course of the disease. Positive and negative signals often balance the immune system. Immune regulatory molecules, also known as immune checkpoint receptors, balance the immune responses. These molecules mainly have inhibitory functions and prevent hyperactivation of immune cells or trigger adverse signaling pathways. For a decade, the immune checkpoint blockade, as a therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy, has been utilized. Some of the inhibitory receptors are recognized as exhaustion markers on T cells. The signaling pathway of these markers restricts the function of T cells against viral infection. Dysregulation of T cells was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection and can modify proliferation, differentiation, cytokine production, and type of response. The pivotal role of immune inhibitory receptors in the function of acquired, cell-mediated, immune defense T cells makes them a fascinating subject to study. This review article summarized recent findings on immune regulatory molecules and their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, hoping to find a way to design novel treatments.","output":"The Role of Immune Regulatory Molecules in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Today, early interventions to treat autistic children through parent training interventions is of outmost importance. Interventions are focused on developmental or behavioral approaches and are mostly individual or group ones. In the present study, both proposed approaches in the form of structured individual and group parent training sessions among Iranian families are investigated. METHOD This study was a randomized clinical trial which was performed in 2019-2020 in Tehran. Forty four 3-5 year-old children with autism participated in the study and were assigned to experimental (n = 22) and control (n = 22) groups through block randomization method. To evaluate the effectiveness of therapy on autism symptoms, Gilliam Autism Rating and Functional Emotional Assessment Scales were used. Also, Parenting Stress Index and Quality of Life Questionnaire were implemented to investigate the secondary effects of the therapy. After 12 therapy sessions, both groups took the posttest and 3 months later, follow up evaluations were performed. RESULTS The treatment group manifested significant improvement regarding autism symptoms in both the posttest and follow up (?2 = .77, P < .05) as well as Functional Emotional Development (?2 = .62, P < .05). Comparing the means indicates that the experimental group mean score is significantly higher in quality of life and lower in parenting stress than the control group's.

METHODS Prospective data of 105 consecutive patients with 106 IAs treated using SMART coils was collected between March 2015 and July 2018. Clinical and angiographic data were analyzed. RESULTS Forty-nine patients (46.7%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and 16 (14.2%) had recurrent aneurysms. Two patients had minor intraprocedural ruptures and remained neurologically stable. One patient had a thromboembolic complication with progressive neurologic decline. There was only one case microcatheter prolapse related to placement of a stent before coiling.

The purpose of this study was to determine if lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) can prevent microgravity-induced alterations of tibial microvascular flow. Head-down tilt (HDT) simulates the cephalad fluid shift and microvascular flow responses that may occur in microgravity. We hypothesized that LBNP prevents HDT-induced increases in tibial microvascular flow. Tibial bone microvascular flow, oxygenation, and calf circumference were measured during 5 min sitting, 5 min supine, 5 min 15 HDT, and 10 min 15 HDT with 25 mmHg LBNP using photoplethysmography (PPG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and strain-gauge plethysmography (SGP). Measurements were made simultaneously. Tibial microvascular flow increased by 36% with 5 min 15 HDT [2.2  1.1 V; repeated-measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) P < 0.0001] from supine (1.4  0.8 V). After 10 min of LBNP in the 15 HDT position, tibial microvascular flow returned to supine levels (1.1  0.5 V; RMANOVA P < 0.001). Tibial oxygenation did not change significantly during sitting, supine, HDT, or HDT with LBNP. However, calf circumference decreased with 5 min 15 HDT (-0.7  0.4 V; RMANOVA P < 0.0001) from supine (-0.5  0.4 V). However, with LBNP calf circumference returned to supine levels (-0.4  0.1 V; RMANOVA P = 0.002).

Yet despite this staggering diversity, all characterized viral fusion proteins convert from a fusion-competent state (dimers or trimers, depending on the class) to a membrane-embedded homotrimeric prehairpin, and then to a trimer-of-hairpins that brings the fusion peptide, attached to the target membrane, and the transmembrane domain, attached to the viral membrane, into close proximity thereby facilitating the union of viral and target membranes. During these conformational conversions, the fusion proteins induce membranes to progress through stages of close apposition, hemifusion, and then the formation of small, and finally large, fusion pores.

For the sake of safety, online consumption has become the most common manner, and this has generated e-commerce, which not only breaks the spatio-temporal or regional restrictions, but also conforms to the normal economic development needs for epidemic prevention and control. However, this new business model causes problems such as the shortage of post-sales service, false publicity, and uneven quality of live streaming anchors, seriously affecting the interests of consumers. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the management of the chaos of live streaming. This study focuses on exploring the problems and the behavioral strategies of stakeholders in the governance process. The paper obtained online user comments by python, and used topic clustering and subject extraction methods to dig out the problems and related multiple subjects in live streaming at first. Secondly, the theory of social preference was introduced to construct an evolutionary game model among multiple subjects, and how to guide the behavioral decision-making of multiple subjects to standardize and rationalize was studied, so as to control the problem of live streaming. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted and the results demonstrated that: (1) Compared with strengthening the reciprocal preference of the government, live streaming platforms, and consumers, changing the individuals altruistic preference is more effective in controlling the chaos of live streaming;(2) weakening the platforms altruistic preference for anchors is conducive to creating a good live streaming environment;and (3) changing consumers altruistic preference or reciprocal preference is less effective in promoting the governance of the live streaming environment.","output":"Evolutionary Game of Multi-Subjects in Live Streaming and Governance Strategies Based on Social Preference Theory during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 11th March 2020, the pandemic of the new coronavirus was declared by the World Health Organization. At the moment, there are no new registered medicines that can effectively treat the coronavirus infection. However, a number of ongoing clinical trials are investigating the efficacy and safety of the medicines which have already been registered and used for the treatment of other diseases, in the treatment of the coronavirus infection. The proposed combinations of these medicines could potentially present a safety risk, since most of these medicines have the potential to cause numerous side or toxic effects, even when used in monotherapy. Thus, the aim of this study was to review and evaluate the literature data on the toxicity of the selected individual drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, remdesivir, chloroquine, and umifenovir) and the available clinical data concerning the possible adverse effects of the selected drug combinations (lopinavir/ritonavir + umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir + interferon ?, chloroquine + remdesivir, and chloroquine + azithromycin). The most often reported toxic effects of these medicines such as hepatotoxicity, retinal damage, nephrotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity, together with the fact that the health status of the patients with COVID-19 disease is often complicated by co-existing illnesses and therapy implicate that the decision on the therapeutic strategy should be made with caution.","output":"An overview of the safety assessment of medicines currently used in the COVID-19 disease treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with Covid-19 place new challenges on the management of type 2 diabetes, including the questions of whether glucose-lowering therapy should be adjusted during infection and how to manage a return to normal care after resolution of Covid-19 symptoms.

The outbreak then spread to the capital, Conakry, and to neighboring countries and has subsequently become the largest epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) to date. METHODS From March 25 to April 26, 2014, we performed a study of all patients with laboratory-confirmed EVD in Conakry. Mortality was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included patient characteristics, complications, treatments, and comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS Of 80 patients who presented with symptoms, 37 had laboratory-confirmed EVD. Among confirmed cases, the median age was 38 years (interquartile range, 28 to 46), 24 patients (65%) were men, and 14 (38%) were health care workers; among the health care workers, nosocomial transmission was implicated in 12 patients (32%). Patients with confirmed EVD presented to the hospital a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 3 to 7) after the onset of symptoms, most commonly with fever (in 84% of the patients; mean temperature, 38.6C), fatigue (in 65%), diarrhea (in 62%), and tachycardia (mean heart rate, >93 beats per minute). Of these patients, 28 (76%) were treated with intravenous fluids and 37 (100%) with antibiotics. Sixteen patients (43%) died, with a median time from symptom onset to death of 8 days (interquartile range, 7 to 11). Patients who were 40 years of age or older, as compared with those under the age of 40 years, had a relative risk of death of 3.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 8.59; P=0.007).

Data scientists apply varied learning-based techniques to identify the underlying patterns in the big medical data to address various health-related issues. In this context, automated disease detection has now become a central concern in medical science due to rapid population growth. It reduces the mortality rate by diagnosing the disease correctly and early enough. The novel virus disease COVID-19 has spread all over the world and is affecting millions of people. Many countries are facing a shortage of test kits, vaccines, and other resources due to substantial growth in COVID-19 cases. In order to accelerate the testing process, scientists around the world have sought to create revolutionary novel alternative methods for the detection of the deadly virus. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for diagnosing the virus from chest X-rays (CXRs). In the proposed model, CNN is used to extract features, and GRU is used as a classifier. The model has been trained on 424 CXRs images with 3 (COIVD-19, Pneumonia, and Normal) classes. The proposed model achieved encouraging results of 0.96, 0.96, and 0.95 in terms of precision, recall, and f1-score, respectively. These findings indicate how deep learning can significantly contribute to the early detection of COVID-19 patients using X-ray scans. Such indications can pave the ways to mitigate the deadly disease. We believe that this model can be an effective tool for medical practitioners for the early diagnosis of coronavirus from CXRs.

The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 highlights an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a chief element in host antiviral defense pathways. In this study, we examined the impact of the STING signaling pathway on coronavirus infection using the HCoV-OC43 model. We found that HCoV-OC43 infection did not stimulate the STING signaling pathway, but the activation of STING signaling effectively inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection to a much greater extent than that of type I interferons (IFNs). We also discovered that IRF3, the key STING downstream innate immune effector, is essential for this anti-coronavirus activity. In addition, we found that the amidobenzimidazole (ABZI)-based human STING agonist (diABZI) robustly blocks the infection of not only HCoV-OC43 but also SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our study identifies the STING signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics against multiple coronavirus strains in order to face the challenge of future coronavirus outbreaks.ImportanceThe highly infectious and lethal SARS-CoV-2 is posing an unprecedented threat to public health.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey of the RANZCOG (Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists) members was conducted. Participants were categorised by seniority level (core trainees, advanced trainees and Fellows). Mean grit and burnout scores were compared with one-way analyses of variance. Correlation between grit and burnout was estimated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with high vs low burnout. Grit was categorised as low/medium/high for regression models. RESULTS A total of 751 (26%) participants completed the survey. Fellows reported higher mean grit than core (P = 0.02) and advanced trainees (P = 0.03), and lower mean burnout than core trainees (P < 0.001).

Three major reasons that hamper the diagnosis earlier in the disease are the unspecific and mild symptoms in the first stage, the cost- and time-limitations of the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and the insufficient sensitivity of this test as desired for screening purposes during the pandemic. More sensitive and earlier methods of COVID-19 detection should be considered as key for breakthrough changes in the disease course and response to specific therapeutic strategies. Our objective was to propose a clinical scoring for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis) that has been validated in a large population sample, aiming to encourage the management of patients with high pre-clinical likelihood of presenting COVID-19, at least during the pandemics, independent of a rtPCR-SARS-COV-2 test. Materials and methods: This is a compounded retrospective and prospective analysis of clinical data prospectively collected from the Pre-AndroCoV and AndroCov Trials that resulted in a clinical scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis based on likelihood of presenting COVID-19 according to the number of symptoms, presence of anosmia, and known positive household contact, in a variety of combinations of scoring criteria, aiming to the detect scorings that provided the highest pre-test probability and accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and accuracy were calculated for subjects screened in two different periods and altogether, for females, males, and both, in a total of nine different scenarios, for combinations between one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia in subjects without known positive household contacts, and no symptoms, one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia or ageusia in subjects with known positive household contacts. Results: 1,757 patients were screened for COVID-19. Among the multiple combinations, requiring two or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia for subjects without known contact and one or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia with known positive contacts presented the highest accuracy (80.4%), and higher pretest probability and accuracy than virtually all rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 commercially available kit tests. Conclusion: The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis was demonstrated to be a feasible, quick, inexpensive and sensitive diagnostic tool for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. A clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 should avoid delays and missed diagnosis, and reduce costs, and should therefore be recommended as a first-line option for COVID-19 diagnosis for public health policies, at least while SARS-CoV-2 is the prevailing circulating virus.","output":"Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19: a prompt, feasible, and sensitive diagnostic tool for COVID-19 based on a 1,757-patient cohort (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Fatigue is a common problem for people with cerebral palsy (CP), which adversely affects health-related outcomes.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and economic value of a shutdown that is successful in 'flattening' or 'squashing the curve' in Germany. Methods: In the base case, the study compared a successful shutdown to a worst-case scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. To this end, a decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19. Results: A shutdown that is successful in 'flattening the curve' is projected to yield an average health gain between 0.01 and 0.05 life years (0.1 to 0.6 months) per capita in the German population. The corresponding economic value ranges between ?616 and ?4797 per capita or, extrapolated to the total population, 1% to 12% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. A shutdown that is successful in 'squashing the curve' is expected to yield a minimum health gain of 0.8 life years (0.9 months) per capita, corresponding to 19% of the GDP in 2019. Results are particularly sensitive to mortality data and the prevalence of undetected cases. Conclusion: A successful shutdown is forecasted to yield a considerable gain in life years in the German population. Nevertheless, questions around the affordability and underfunding of other parts of the healthcare system emerge.","output":"The Clinical and Economic Value of a Successful Shutdown During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: Since December 2019, more than 100,000 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been confirmed globally based on positive viral nucleic acids with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the association between clinical, laboratory and CT characteristics and RT-PCR results is still unclear. We sought to examine this association in detail, especially in recovered patients. Methods: We analysed data from 52 confirmed patients who had been discharged with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were dynamically recorded and compared with the admission and follow-up RT-PCR results. Results: In this cohort, 52 admitted COVID-19 patients who had confirmed positive RT-PCR results were discharged after 2 rounds of consecutively negative RT-PCR results. Compared with admission levels, CRP levels (median 4.93 mg/L [IQR: 1.78-10.20]) decreased significantly (p<0.001). and lymphocyte counts (median 1.50109/L [IQR: 1.11-1.88]) increased obviously after obtaining negative RT-PCR results (p<0.001). Additionally, substantially improved inflammatory exudation was observed on chest CT except for 2 progressed patients. At the two-week follow-up after discharge, 7 patients had re-positive RT-PCR results, including the abovementioned 2 progressed patients. Among the 7 patients, new GGO was demonstrated in 2 patients. There were no significant differences in CPR levels or lymphocyte counts when comparing the negative and re-positive PCT results (all p >0.05). Conclusion: Heterogeneity between CT features and RT-PCR results was found in COVID-19, especially in some recovered patients with negative RT-PCR results.

It is observed that the Graphical Keyword Extraction Techniques (GKET) use Graph of Words (GoW) in literature for analysis in different dimensions. In this article, efforts have been made to study these different dimensions for GKET, namely, the GoW representation, the statistical properties of GoW, the stability of the structure of GoW, the diversity in approaches over GoW for GKET, and the ranking of nodes in GoW. To elucidate these different dimensions, a comprehensive survey of GKET is carried in different domains to make some inferences out of the existing literature.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on December 2020 among health care professionals (HCP) in the University Hospital Tahar Sfar Mahdia. The measurement tool was developed by specialists at the Department of Preventive Medicine after reviewing literature then pretested. RESULTS: A total of 173 HCP were enrolled with an average age of 35 9.3 years. More than half of participants were females (64.7%), 32.9% were doctors and 34.7% were nurses. Among them, 35.8% have worked during a pandemic before. The level of good knowledge was 52%. The main sources of information for HCP were the Ministry of Health (63.6%), social network and media (58.4%). About 25.4% of HCP was satisfied by the preventive measures training received in the hospital. Half of HCP (54.3%) admitted that their knowledge related to the pandemic was not sufficient. While third of the HCP (31.8%) thought that it is necessary to wear the full PPE, 16.8% knew how to put on their PPE and 27.2% knew how to take it off.

Most diagnoses are made by family physicians (FPs) and based on symptoms and clinical signs rather than on diagnostic testing. The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) advocates that FPs record patients Reasons for Encounters (RfEs) as they are presented to them. This study analyses the association of patients RfEs with FPs diagnoses of ILI and ARI diagnoses and FPs management of those patients. METHODS: Cohort study of practice populations. Over a 4-month period during the winter season 2013C14, eight FPs recorded ILI and ARI patients RfEs and how they were managed. FPs recorded details of their patients using the ICPC format, collecting data in an Episode of Care (EoC) structure. RESULTS: There were 688 patients diagnosed as having ILI; between them they presented with a total of 2,153 RfEs, most commonly fever (79.7%), cough (59.7%) and pain (33.0%). The 848 patients with ARI presented with a total of 1,647 RfEs, most commonly cough (50.4%), throat symptoms (25.9%) and fever (19.9%). For patients with ILI, 37.0% of actions were related to medication for respiratory symptoms; this figure was 38.4% for patients with ARI. FPs referred six patients to specialists or hospitals (0.39% of all patients diagnosed with ILI and ARI). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with ILI and ARI, less than half received a prescription from their FPs, and the illnesses were mainly managed in primary care, with few patients needing referral. The ICPC classification allowed a standardised data collection system, providing documentary evidence of the management of those diseases.

In contrast to their protective anti-microbial functions, inappropriate or excessive activation of nucleic acid sensors can cause inflammatory diseases. Nucleic acid sensing is therefore tightly controlled by regulatory factors acting through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Recently, it has become clearer that metabolic pathways-previously thought to be unconnected with immune responses-can influence nucleic acid sensing. This regulation can be observed when immune system cells undergo metabolic reprogramming in response to stimulation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide from gram negative bacteria. Metabolic reprogramming leads to accumulation and secretion of metabolites, which have been mostly viewed as end-products of processes providing cellular energy and building blocks. However, metabolites have now been identified as important regulators of nucleic acid sensing. This mini-review aims to outline current knowledge on regulation of central nucleic acid sensing pathways by metabolites during metabolic reprogramming.","output":"Cellular Metabolites Regulate Central Nucleic Acid Sensing Pathways."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate viral infection in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in Shanghai, and to analyze the clinical characteristics and biomarkers in viral infection.

The miRNACtarget RNA recognition forms initially through pairing at the seed region while the additional supplementary pairing can enhance target recognition and compensate for seed mismatch. The extension of miRNA lengths can strengthen the target affinity when pairing both in the seed and supplementary regions. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of the supplementary pairing on the conformational dynamics and the assembly of AGOCRNA complex remains poorly understood. To address this, we performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of AGOCRNA complexes with different pairing patterns and miRNA lengths. The results reveal that the additional supplementary pairing can not only strengthen the interaction between miRNA and target RNA, but also induce the increased plasticity of the PAZ domain and enhance the domain connectivity among the PAZ, PIWI, N domains of the AGO protein. The strong community network between these domains tightens the mouth of the supplementary chamber of AGO protein, which prevents the escape of target RNA from the complex and shields it from solvent water attack. Importantly, the inner stronger matching pairs between the miRNA and target RNA can compensate for weaker mismatches at the edge of supplementary region. These findings provide guidance for the design of miRNA mimics and anti-miRNAs for both clinical and experimental use and open the way for further engineering of AGO proteins as a new tool in the field of gene regulation.","output":"Elucidation of the conformational dynamics and assembly of ArgonauteCRNA complexes by distinct yet coordinated actions of the supplementary microRNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Los estudios ecolgicos son uno de los dise?os ms frecuentemente empleados para tratar de establecer la asociacin de ciertos factores con el desarrollo de enfermedades.

In a first group of 103 workers (89 exposed and 14 controls) the serum concentrations of antibodies against Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) were measured, whereas in the second group of 96 workers (64 exposed and 32 controls) the serum concentrations of antibodies against Leptospira spp., Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi, Brucella spp. and Salmonella spp. were addressed. Imunization against tretanus was also studied in this group. RESULTS Animal breeders showed higher rates of IgG antibodies against Coxiella burnetii (50% vs. 31.2%), and Leptospira spp. (59.4% vs. 43.7%). Results of logistic regression analysis revealed that breeder workers showed a tendency to have higher prevalence of positivity for antibodies to Leptospira spp.and Coxiella burnetii than non-breeders (ORs ~ 3). Only one exposed subject showed antibodies against hepatitis E (none in controls), but when tested with another commercially available kit the percentage of anti HEV IgG positive subjects increased to 22.3% in the exposed, while none of the controls showed positive. None of the subjects showed antibodies against Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp. Italians and other European workers have better protection against tetanus (91%) compared to non-EU workers (81%). CONCLUSIONS The higher frequency of the presence of serum antibodies to zoonotic agents (e.g. Leptospira spp. and Coxiella burnetii) in animal breeders suggests that they are more exposed to biological agents than workers not involved in animal breeding activities.

STUDY DESIGN For 34 European countries, publicly available data were collected on daily numbers of COVID-19 deaths, population size, healthcare capacity, government restrictions and their timing, tourism and change in mobility during the pandemic. METHODS Univariate and multivariate generalised linear models using different selection algorithms (forward, backward, stepwise and genetic algorithm) were analysed with height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak and time to the peak as dependent variables. RESULTS The proportion of the population living in urban areas, mobility at the day of first reported death and number of infections when borders were closed were assessed as significant predictors of the height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak. Testing the model with variety of selection algorithms provided consistent results. Total hospital bed capacity, population size, number of foreign travellers and day of border closure, were found as significant predictors of time to COVID-19 daily deaths peak. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis demonstrated that countries with higher proportions of the population living in urban areas, with lower reduction in mobility at the beginning of the pandemic, and countries which closed borders having more infected people experienced higher peak of COVID-19 deaths. Greater bed capacity, bigger population size and later border closure could result in delaying time to reach the deaths peak, whereas a high number of foreign travellers could accelerate it.","output":"Factors influencing the COVID-19 daily deaths peak across European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most COVID-19 cases are treated as outpatients, while the majority of studies on COVID-19 focus on inpatients Little is known about the self-reporting and self-rating of the disease's symptoms, and the associations of prophylactic use of dietary supplements with COVID-19 severity have not been addressed The aims of this study are to evaluate COVID-19 severity and to relate them to sociodemographic characteristics and prophylactic dietary supplements An observational patient-based study conducted through an online questionnaire on recovered COVID-19 patients The patients were assessed for several severity parameters, sociodemographic parameters, and prophylactic dietary supplement use A total of 428 patients were evaluated Age and presence of comorbidities had positive associations with the severity parameters The severe infection group had the highest proportion of patients stressed about COVID-19 (P &lt; 0 05) Cigarette, but not hookah, smoking was significantly associated with less severe symptoms Vitamin D negatively predicted disease severity (P &lt; 0 05) In conclusion, stress, age, and presence of comorbidities were the most important positive predictors of COVID-19 severity, while prophylactic vitamin D use and smoking were significant negative predictors The use of protective measures and other prophylactic dietary supplements was not significantly associated with symptom severity","output":"COVID-19 severity in relation to sociodemographics and vitamin D use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The past year has seen a global pandemic of COVID-19, with extremely high transmission and mortality rates causing worldwide alarm and a significant negative impact on the global economy and human security.

Despite a significant prevalence rate of HIV and growing numbers of this population group, data are still scarce, and studies have neglected them in Sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this protocol is to outline the methodological process of a systematic review that will gather qualitative and quantitative data to critically examine sex differences in HIV testing among elders (age 50+) in Sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS This protocol adheres to the PRISMA-P reporting guidelines. We will conduct a systematic database search to retrieve all observational and qualitative studies. Electronic search strategies will be developed for MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health, and CINAHL for studies reporting HIV data. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. The search strategy will consist of free-text and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Search terms for elders (50+) will include the following: \\"elders\\", \\"older adults\\", \\"aged\\", \\"geriatric\\" and \\"seniors\\". The primary outcome of interest is sex differences in the uptake of HIV counselling and testing (HCT). The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using appropriate tools. Screening, data extraction, and assessments of risk of bias will be performed independently by two reviewers. Narrative synthesis will be conducted with studies that are compatible based on population and outcome. As it will be a systematic review, without human participants' involvement, there will be no requirement for ethical approval. DISCUSSION The systematic review will present key evidence on sex differences in HIV testing among elders in Sub-Saharan Africa. The findings will be used to inform program developers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to enhance sex disaggregated HIV data to improve access to HIV counselling and testing service for elders in Sub-Saharan Africa.

For grandparents in England, this meant that provision of care for grandchildren was allowed only under very limited circumstances. Evidence also suggests that reduced face-to-face interactions took a toll on mental health during the pandemic. This study aims to investigate whether changes in grandchild care provision during the pandemic impacted grandparents' mental health. Methods: Using pre-pandemic data from Wave 9 (2018/19) and the second Covid-19 sub-study (November/December 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we first describe changes in grandparenting since the start of the pandemic to then investigate, using regression models, associations between changes in grandparenting and mental health (depression, quality of life, life satisfaction) during the pandemic, while controlling for pre-pandemic levels of the outcome variables. Results: About 10% of grandparents stopped altogether to look after grandchildren during the pandemic, with 22% reporting an overall decrease in the amount of grandchild care provided and 20% an increase or similar levels. Compared to grandparents who mostly maintained unchanged their grandchild care provision, those who stopped altogether and those who mostly reduced the amount of grandchild care provided were more likely to report poorer mental health, even accounting for pre-pandemic health. Discussion: While measures to limit physical contact and shield older people were necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, policymakers should acknowledge potential adverse consequences for mental health among grandparents who experienced changes in their roles as grandchild caregivers.","output":"Grandparental Childcare During the Pandemic and Effects on Mental Health: Evidence From England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initial COVID-19 vaccine candidates were based on the original sequence of SARS-CoV-2.

As new research is published daily, the analysis is regularly updated to show the status as the research field develops and matures. METHODS: Two bibliometric methods were employed, the first is a keyword co-occurrence analysis, based on published work available from PubMed. The second is a bibliometric coupling analysis, based on articles available through Scopus. The results are presented as clustered network graphs; available as interactive network graphs through the webpage. RESULTS: For research as of March 23rd, keyword co-occurrence analysis showed that research was organized in 4 topic clusters: Health and pandemic management, The disease and its pathophysiology, Clinical epidemiology of the disease and Treatment of the disease. Coupling analyses resulted in 4 clusters on literature that relates to Overview of the new virus, Clinical medicine, On the virus and Reproduction rate and spread. CONCLUSION: We introduced a dynamic resource that will give a wide readership an overview of how the structure of the COVID-19 literature is developing.

RESULTS: We detected the presence of novel highly divergent viruses in the fecal material of the carnivores analyzed, such as five gemycircularviruses. Four of these gemycircularviruses were found in the mongoose and one in the badger. In addition we also identified an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene from a putative novel member of the Nodaviridae family in the fecal material of the otter. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results underline that many novel viruses are yet to be discovered and that fecal associated viruses are not always related to disease.

Traditionally these lesions have required a deconstructive approach consisting of vessel sacrifice since their fragile nature often makes direct microsurgical repair or coil embolization hazardous. As a high-viscosity liquid embolic agent that results in immediate, vessel sparing aneurysm occlusion, Onyx-HD 500 represents a uniquely efficacious tool for this clinical situation. CASE SUMMARY We report the case of a 56-year-old right-handed gentleman who suffered a vascular injury to the ICA during revision transsphenoidal surgery for a recurrent pituitary macroadenoma. The patient was initially treated with nasal packing, but after recurrent episodes of epistaxis and a CT angiogram demonstrating a large traumatic ICA pseudoaneurysm, the patient was referred for invasive treatment. Given the presumed fragility of the lesion, embolization with Onyx-HD 500 was chosen in order to safely achieve immediate aneurysm occlusion without the need for vessel sacrifice. After an early recurrence due to incomplete initial embolization, the patient went on to complete occlusion without further hemorrhage. CONCLUSION This case illustrates the utility of a high-viscosity liquid embolic agent in providing immediate protection from rehemorrhage by occluding a large ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the proximal intracranial ICA, while sparing the parent artery.","output":"Onyx-HD 500 Embolization of a Traumatic Internal Carotid Artery Pseudoaneurysm after Transsphenoidal Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This survey analyses the role of data-driven methodologies for pandemic modelling and control.

RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently presenting in the form of a global pandemic, referred to as COVID-19. In this setting, multiple states have issued executive orders prohibiting elective surgery, including arthroplasty, in order to preserve healthcare resources. However, during this unprecedented reduction in elective surgery, there is likely to be some controversy as to what constitutes a purely elective procedure, versus an urgent procedure, particularly regarding hip arthroplasty. We reviewed the available literature for articles discussing the most commonly encountered indications for primary, conversion, and revision hip arthroplasty. Based upon the indications discussed in these articles, we further stratified these indications into elective versus urgent categories. SUMMARY: In patients presenting with hip arthroplasty indications, the decision to proceed urgently with surgery should be based upon (a) the potential harm incurred by the patient if the surgery was delayed and (b) the potential risk incurred by the patient in the context of COVID-19 if surgery was performed. The authors present a decision-making algorithm for determining surgical urgency in three patients who underwent surgery in this context. Urgent total hip arthroplasty in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex decision-making process, involving clinical and epidemiological factors. These decisions are best made in coordination with a multidisciplinary committee of ones peers.

The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug design. Further, &#945;-ketoamide is proved to be very effective as a reversible covalent-inhibitor against cysteine proteases. Herein, we report on the non-covalent to the covalent adduct formation mechanism of &#945;-ketoamide-based inhibitor with the enzyme active site amino acids by QM/SQM model (QM = quantum mechanical, SQM = semi-empirical QM). To uncover the mechanism, we focused on two approaches: a concerted and a stepwise fashion. The concerted pathway proceeds via deprotonation of the thiol of cysteine (here, Cys145 S?3H) and simultaneous reversible nucleophilic attack of sulfur onto the &#945;-ketoamide warhead. In this work, we propose three plausible concerted pathways. On the contrary, in a traditional two-stage pathway, the first step is proton transfer from Cys145 S?3H to His41 N? forming an ion pair, and consecutively, in the second step, the thiolate ion attacks the &#945;-keto group to form a thiohemiketal. In this reaction, we find that the stability of the tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion/hydroxyl group plays an important role. Moreover, as the &#945;-keto group has two faces Si or Re for the nucleophilic attack, we considered both possibilities of attack leading to S- and R-thiohemiketal. We computed the structural, electronic, and energetic parameters of all stationary points including transition states via ONIOM and pure DFT method.

METHODS: A prospective web-based survey was proposed to all AISF active members. The survey was available online from April 8 2020 to May 3 2020 (lockdown phase in Italy). RESULTS: 194 AISF members answered the questionnaire, most of whom were specialists in Gastroenterology (41%) or Internal Medicine (28%), and worked in Northern Italy (51%). 26% of hepatology wards had been converted into COVID-19 wards, and 33% had had bed reductions. All hepatological activities, including the management of patients with decompensated liver disease, liver transplant and HCC had been significantly reduced/stopped. The number of physicians answering that their practices had not been modified ranged between 0.6% (for chronic hepatitis) to 47% (for the execution of paracentesis). The recorded answers were consistent among different regions, and did not show any north-south gradient CONCLUSION: COVID-19 outbreak significantly impacted on hepatological clinical activity.

METHODS A total of 831 patients with confirmed or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection treated in People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from July 2020 to August 2020 were enrolled as study group, and 2 778 healthy people in a third Grade A hospital in the region during the same period were selected as control group. ABO and Rh(D) blood group antigens were identified, and relevant medical data were collected for statistical analysis. RESULTS The proportion of O-type population and Rh(D) positive population in the study group was 24.79% and 96.27%, which were lower than those in the normal control group (29.73% and 97.73%) (P<0.05). The proportion of AB type and Rh(D) negative population was 14.20% and 3.73%, which was higher than that in control group (10.62% and 2.27%) (P<0.05). The proportion of female patients in Type O group was lower than that in control group. The proportion of female patients in AB group was higher than that in control group (P<0.01), while the proportion of type O patients in the age group less than or equal to 45 years old and greater than 60 years old was lower.

Prior to the emergence of highly infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2 and implementation of vaccination programme, we conducted a questionnaire study to explore the role of behavioural factors influencing transmission at an essential services workplace during an outbreak of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study. METHODS: In response to a COVID-19 outbreak in November 2020 at an office-based call centre workplace providing an essential service in Thames Valley, we designed and conducted an anonymous staff questionnaire to explore potential behavioural factors of staff behaviour that influence transmission. RESULTS: A total of 45 staff (27%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 over a six-week period between 26 October and 14 December 2020. The online questionnaire was cascaded to 168 staff members; the response rate was 41%. Self-reported use of hand sanitiser, face masks and cleaning of equipment in line with workplace guidance was 86%, 66% and 63% respectively. On the same behaviours, respondents reported that 33%, 31% and 14% of their colleagues followed the recommendations. Almost two thirds of respondents (63%) reported that they were unable to maintain social distancing at the workplace, primarily due to operational constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention and control of COVID-19 outbreaks at workplaces providing an essential service is challenging. Operational requirements, often compounded by reduced staff availability, impede implementation of more robust control measures. Ongoing assessment of human behavioural factors in the control of COVID-19 outbreaks at workplaces in the post-vaccine era is essential.","output":"Lessons learnt from an outbreak of COVID-19 in a workplace providing an essential service, Thames Valley, England 2020: implications for investigation and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has overlapped with the scheduled interview periods of over 20 surgical subspecialty fellowships, including the Complex General Surgical Oncology (CGSO) fellowships in the National Resident Matching Program and the Society of Surgical Oncologys Breast Surgical Oncology fellowships.

We aimed to explore the psychological and cognitive factors modulating behaviour and intentions during the national lockdown in Italy. We administered an online questionnaire (N = 244) that included tests for assessing personality traits (Temperament and Character Inventory; Locus of Control of Behaviour) and moral judgment (Moral Foundations Questionnaire), alongside behavioural economics tasks addressing different facets of risk attitude (loss aversion, risk aversion and delay discounting). We then assessed the extent to which individual variations in these dimensions modulated participants compliance with the lockdown norms. When assessing their joint contribution via multiple regressions, lockdown adherence was mostly predicted by internal locus of control, psycho-economic dimensions suggestive of long-sighted and loss-averse attitudes, as well as personality traits related to cautionary behaviour, such as harm avoidance, and the authority moral concern. These findings show that a multi-domain assessment of the factors underlying personal intentions, and thus driving compliance with government measures, can help predict individuals actions during health emergencies.

Such actions can reduce the number of simultaneous infections and mitigate the disease spreading, which is relevant to the risk of a healthcare system collapse. Although these strategies can be suggested, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception of the disease risk. The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that some individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated, avoiding unnecessary contacts. With this motivation, we propose an epidemiological SIR model that uses evolutionary game theory to take into account dynamic individual quarantine strategies, intending to combine in a single process social strategies, individual risk perception, and viral spreading. The disease spreads in a population whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is individual and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The game payoff governs the strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs the agent's health state. At the same time, the infection rate depends on the agent's strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of infected agents. Results show recurrent infection waves, which were seen in previous epidemic scenarios with quarantine. Notably, the risk perception is found to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak, while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection rates. Low awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease risk leads to shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the fundamental role of social strategies.","output":"An epidemiological model with voluntary quarantine strategies governed by evolutionary game dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Perinatal asphyxia, resulting in hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), has been associated with high mortality rates and severe lifelong neurodevelopmental disabilities.

An upregulation of neuroinflammatory pathways was also noted and this was confirmed by pathway analysis. Principal component analysis revealed a gradient from favourable to unfavourable HIE grades and outcomes. The proteins that provided strong predictors were structural proteins, including myelin basic protein and alpha II-spectrin. The functional proteins included energy- related proteins like neuron specific enolase and synaptic regulatory proteins.

Some of them are grown as ornamental plants and others can be used as medicinal plants. In the present study, ethanolic extracts from trunks and leaves of Tecoma species were tested in vitro using assays against the Zika virus. METHODS There was a total of 8 extracts obtained from different anatomical parts of three Tecoma species. The Tecoma castaneifolia, T. garrocha, T. stans var. angustata and T. stans var. stans were prepared by percolation with ethanol. The antiviral activity was assayed in vitro against the Zika virus by the MTT colorimetric method (n = 3). The UPLC-DAD-MS analysis of ethanolic extracts was performed from all the studied species. The biofractionation of T. stans var. stans trunk extract using different separation techniques led to the isolation of crenatoside compound. RESULTS Ethanolic extract from Tecoma species leaves were more active against the Zika virus (EC50 149.90 to 61.25 g/mL) when compared to the trunk extracts tested (EC50 131.0 to 66.79 g/mL and two were not active). The ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions obtained from T. stans var. stans trunk were active against the Zika virus with EC50 values of 149.90 and 78.98 g/mL, respectively. Crenatoside is a phenylethanoid glycoside isolated from the ethyl acetate of T. stans var. stans trunk extract. This compound was tested and exhibited EC50 34.78 M (21.64 g/mL), thus demonstrating a better result than the original ethanolic extracts as well as others extracts of Tecoma species, and it was more active than the positive control, ribavirin (386.84 M). Furthermore, its selectivity index was at least 2.5 times higher than the tested ethanolic extracts and 11.1 times more potent than ribavirin. CONCLUSION The Tecoma species demonstrated interesting in vitro activity against the Zika virus. The crenatoside, phenylethanoid glycoside that was for the first time isolated from Tecoma stans var. stans, exhibited a potent and relevant anti-Zika virus activity, being more active than ribavirin (positive control).

OBJECTIVE: We have developed and applied an emergency plan, tailored for Outpatients with endocrine diseases. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study from March to May 2020. SETTING: Referral University-Hospital center. PATIENTS: 1262 patients in 8 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: The emergency plan is based upon the endocrine triage, the stay-safe procedures and the tele-Endo. During endocrine triage every patient was contacted by phone to assess health status and define if the visit will be performed face-to-face (F2F) or by tele-Medicine (tele-Endo). In case of F2F, targeted stay-safe procedures have been adopted. Tele-Endo, performed by phone and email, is dedicated to COVID-19-infected patients, to elderly or frail people, or to those with a stable disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: To assess efficacy of the emergency plan to continue the follow-up of Outpatients. RESULTS: The number of visits cancelled after endocrine triage (9%) is lower than that cancelled independently by the patients (37%, p < 0.001); the latter reduced from 47 to 19% during the weeks of lockdown (p = 0.032). 86% of patients contacted by endocrine-triage received a clinical response (F2F and tele-Endo visits).

RESULTS: Among the 287 patients, 100 (36%) were vitamin D sufficient (25[OH]D >30 ng/mL) and 41 (14%) died during hospitalization. Multivariate analysis in patients aged &#8805;65 years revealed that vitamin D sufficiency (25[OH]D &#8805;30 ng/mL) was statistically significantly associated with decreased odds of death (adjusted OR 0.33, 95% CI, 0.12-0.94), acute respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted OR 0.22, 95% CI, 0.05-0.96), and severe sepsis/septic shock (adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI, 0.08-0.88), after adjustment for potential confounders. Among patients with body mass index <30 kg/m2, vitamin D sufficiency was statistically significantly associated with a decreased odds of death (adjusted OR 0.18, 95% CI, 0.04-0.84). No significant association was found in the subgroups of patients aged <65 years or with body mass index &#8805;30 kg/m2. CONCLUSION: We revealed an independent association between vitamin D sufficiency defined by serum 25(OH)D &#8805;30 ng/mL and decreased risk of mortality from COVID-19 in elderly patients and patients without obesity.","output":"Association of Vitamin D Status With Hospital Morbidity and Mortality in Adult Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health crises have become a popular topic of discussion.

The global economy is no exception, for it has been severely affected by the unprecedented public health crisis leading businesspeople to shutdown commercial establishments and dramatically shifting businesses into digital platforms. Immense challenges brought by the pandemic have turned into great opportunities among entrepreneurs from different parts of the globe. In pursuit of the recovery path, they considered digital tools to be instrumental to surviving the crisis and even thriving in the long term. This study explores drivers and barriers to digital innovations in micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) during economic disruptions from the perspective of Filipino young entrepreneurs. Researchers employed a qualitative method for the conduct of in-depth interviews with 46 online entrepreneurs in the Philippines and transcribed them for Inductive Content Analysis to generate themes. Results found the adverse effects of the pandemic, which reinforce entrepreneurial innovations of shifting businesses to digital platforms, categorized into intrinsic (e.g., personal and professional growth) and extrinsic (e.g., mobility restrictions, market conditions, and household economic status) motivations. Participants described the barriers to digital entrepreneurship, including skills needed for doing online business, market-related problems in digital platforms, availability of quality internet infrastructures, and the pandemic restrictions. The findings of this study contribute to the entrepreneurship literature and areas for an empirical investigation to develop programs that support entrepreneurs during economic disruptions. This would serve as a guidepost in the formulation of government policies and strategies for economic recovery through digital entrepreneurship while considering the perspectives of young entrepreneurs. This further recommends future related researches to empower entrepreneurs, particularly those in the developing economies during the pandemic and beyond.","output":"Digital Innovations in MSMEs during Economic Disruptions: Experiences and Challenges of Young Entrepreneurs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: Potential drug resistance (DR) related variants in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase (RT) region may be associated with the effectiveness of antiviral drugs and disease progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of potential DR-related variants in Chinese CHB patients not receiving nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Patients and Methods: Two hundred and six untreated CHB patients from Huzhou Central Hospital in eastern China were recruited for this study. The serum DNA was extracted and the HBV RT region was amplified using nest polymerase chain reaction (nest-PCR). The 42 potential DR-related variants were analyzed by direct sequencing. Results: Among these CHB patients, HBV genotype B and genotype C were identified in 121 (58.7%) and 85 (41.3%) patients, respectively. Potential DR-related variants were detected in 42.7% (88/206) of patients. Primary and secondary DR variants were found in 7.3% (15/206) of patients, including rtL80I/V, rtI169T, rtV173L rtL180M, rtA181T/V, rtM204I/V, and rtN236T. The variants at rt53, rt82, rt221, rt233, rt237, and rt256 were specific for genotype B, and those at rt38, rt84, rt126, rt139, rt153, rt191, rt214, rt238, and rt242 were specific for genotype C. Moreover, the variation frequency in the A-B interdomain (3.96%) was significantly higher than that in the functional domains (1.17%) and non-A-B interdomains (1.11%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lower HBV-DNA load (<106 IU/mL) was an independent factor associated with potential DR-related variants in untreated CHB patients (P <0.05). Conclusion: Potential DR-related variants were frequent and complex in untreated Chinese CHB patients. Furthermore, the variants may contribute to decreased serum HBV-DNA loads. However, the effects of potential DR-related variants on the antiviral therapy and liver disease progression require further study.","output":"Prevalence of Potential Resistance Related Variants Among Chinese Chronic Hepatitis B Patients Not Receiving Nucleos(T)ide Analogues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of adults and children worldwide.

Btk inhibition has shown impressive clinical efficacy in various B cell malignancies. However, it remains unknown whether inhibition additionally induces changes in BCR signaling due to feedback mechanisms, a phenomenon referred to as BCR rewiring. In this report, we studied the impact of Btk activity on major components of the BCR signaling pathway in mice. As expected, NF-&#954;B and Akt/S6 signaling was decreased in Btk-deficient B cells. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of several proximal signaling molecules including CD79a, Syk and PI3K, as well as the key Btk-effector PLC?32 and the more downstream kinase Erk were significantly increased. This pattern of BCR rewiring was essentially opposite in B cells from transgenic mice overexpressing Btk. Importantly, prolonged Btk inhibitor treatment of wild-type mice or mice engrafted with leukemic B cells also resulted in increased phosho-CD79a and phospho-PLC?32 in B cells. Our findings show that Btk enzymatic function determines phosphorylation of proximal and distal BCR signaling molecules in B cells. We conclude that Btk inhibitor treatment results in rewiring of BCR signaling, which may affect both malignant and healthy B cells. This article is protected by copyright.

PURPOSE To assess the independent contribution of MI as part of a behavioral weight management program (BWMP) in controlling weight and improving psychological well-being. DATA SOURCES 6 electronic databases and 2 trial registries, searched from database inception through 24 September 2021. STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials in adults or adolescents aimed at weight loss or maintenance and comparing programs incorporating MI versus interventions without MI. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes included weight, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and other aspects of psychological well-being. Pooled mean differences or standardized mean differences were obtained using random- and fixed-effects meta-analyses. DATA SYNTHESIS Forty-six studies involving 11 077 participants, predominantly with obesity, were included. At 6 months, BWMPs using MI were more effective than no/minimal intervention (-0.88 [95% CI, -1.27 to -0.48] kg; I 2 = 0%) but were not statistically significantly more effective than lower-intensity (-0.88 [CI, -2.39 to 0.62] kg; I 2 = 55.8%) or similar-intensity (-1.36 [CI, -2.80 to 0.07] kg; I 2 = 18.8%) BWMPs. At 1 year, data were too sparse to pool comparisons with no/minimal intervention, but MI did not produce statistically significantly greater weight change compared with lower-intensity (-1.16 [CI, -2.49 to 0.17] kg; I 2 = 88.7%) or similar-intensity (-0.18 [CI, -2.40 to 2.04] kg; I 2 = 72.7%) BWMPs without MI. Studies with 18-month follow-up were also sparse; MI did not produce statistically significant benefit in any of the comparator categories. There was no evidence of subgroup differences based on study, participant, or intervention characteristics. Too few studies assessed effects on psychological well-being to pool, but data did not suggest that MI was independently effective. LIMITATIONS High statistical heterogeneity among studies, largely unexplained by sensitivity and subgroup analyses; stratification by comparator intensity and follow-up duration resulted in pooling of few studies. CONCLUSION There is no evidence that MI increases effectiveness of BWMPs in controlling weight. Given the intensive training required for its delivery, MI may not be a worthwhile addition to BWMPs.

Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are highly susceptible to environmental stress. In the current study, we aimed to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic psychologically affected patients with chronic progressive diseases such as AS and RA and the effects of these psychological factors on disease activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age and gender-matched patients with AS (n=80), RA (n=80), and healthy controls (n=80) were included in the study. All participants were evaluated with the ?Perceived COVID-19 Threat Form (PCTF)?, ?Suicide-Ideation Scale (SIS)?, ?Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)?, ?The Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT)? and ?Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB)? scales. BASDAI was used in patients with AS and DAS28 was used in patients with RA to assess disease severity. RESULTS: Compared to healthy individuals, patients with RA and AS had lower PGWB scores and higher HADS depression and anxiety subscale scores. Almost all psychometric assessment test scores were worse in AS patients with high-disease activity compared to those in low-disease activity. PACT scores were higher in patients with moderate RA compared to patients with mild RA (p=0.006). While a positive correlation was identified between BASDAI and most of the psychometric assessment test scores (r=0 .36 for PCTF, r= 0.53 for depressive scores, r= 0.54 for anxiety scores, r= 0.57 for suicidal ideation), DAS28 scores were found to be associated only with PACT total and PACT perceived forward-focused subscale scores (r= -.26 and r= .33, respectively). CONCLUSION: Psychologically, AS and RA patients were found to be worse off compared to healthy controls. The perceived COVID threat and psychological status were associated with disease activity in AS, but not RA patients. Patients with chronic illnesses may be more vulnerable to the psychological effects of the pandemic, which can worsen disease activity.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychology and Disease Activity in Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leaders of major health care systems in St. Louis, Missouri, joined forces to form a pandemic task force grounded in military planning and decision-making protocols and processes to address needs and concerns related to the coronavirus.","output":"The Covid-19 War: Military Lessons Applied to a Public Health Campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a complex cardiovascular disease whose development involves the dysregulation of adaptive immune responses.

RESULTS We found that patients with AMI and UA had lower BCR repertoire diversity compared with controls with normal coronary arteries (NCA). Lower percentages of productive unique BCR nt sequences and higher percentages of top 200 unique BCR sequences were identified in AMI and UA patients than NCA controls. Patients had various preferential usage of V and J genes from B cell clones in accordance with the disease severity of coronary arteries.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide concern that has created major issues with many aspects. It is important to identify the risk factors for severe outcomes of this disease. To date, no association between viral hepatitis and severe COVID-19 has not been established. METHODS: Through November 5(th), 2020, the databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, and medRxiv were systematically searched using specific keywords related to the focus of the study. All articles published on COVID-19 and viral hepatitis were retrieved. The Mantel-Haenszel formula with random-effects models was used to obtain the risk ratio (RR) along with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous variables. The two-tailed p-value was set with a value 0.05 considered statistically significant. Restricted-maximum likelihood meta-regression was done for several variables, such as age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, and other liver disease. RESULTS: Analysis results included a total of 16 studies with a total of 14,682 patients. Meta-analysis showed that viral hepatitis increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19 (RR 1.68 (95% CI 1.26 C 2.22), p = 0.0003, I(2 )= 21%, random-effect modeling). According to the meta-regression analysis, the association between viral hepatitis and severe COVID-19 was not influenced by age (p = 0.067), diabetes (p = 0.057), or other liver disease (p = 0.646). CONCLUSION: An increase of severe COVID-19 risk is associated with viral hepatitis. To reduce the risk of COVID-19, patients with viral hepatitis should be monitored carefully.","output":"Association between viral hepatitis and increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human-computer interaction (HCI) focuses on the interaction between humans and computers and it exists ubiquitously in our daily lives, especially in post COVID era where non-face-to-face interaction is common.

Having proven its effectiveness in cholecystectomy and appendectomy, the feasibility of SILS in more advanced surgery, such as hemicolectomy and low anterior resection, is now a point of discussion. METHODS This study reports on the results of the first 50 SILS colorectal operations at our institution. Twenty right hemicolectomies, 16 sigmoid resections, 9 low anterior resections, and 5 total colectomies were performed. Nineteen patients were operated for benign colonic diseases, 31 for malignant disease. RESULTS Mean operative time was 130 min, and the median duration of postoperative hospital stay was 6 days. None of the procedures needed conversion to a laparotomy, but four patients were converted to a multiport laparoscopy. In one case, an anastomotic leakage occurred, which was treated by creating a diverting ileostomy laparoscopically. Minor complications were four wound infections and two incisional hernias. CONCLUSION SILS colectomy is a safe and feasible procedure even in more complex cases.

Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions. Based on a publicly available COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method. The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training convergence. In addition, our proposed Multi-encoder learning method incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can also be further generalized to other medical tasks.","output":"Does Non-COVID19 Lung Lesion Help?

Although this pathway has been studied for years, its relevance is still not familiar to many working in the fields of clinical antibiotic resistance and stewardship. Under some conditions, the SOS response favors DNA repair and preserves the genetic integrity of the organism. On the other hand, the SOS response also includes induction of error-prone DNA polymerases, which can increase the rate of mutation, called the mutator phenotype or \\"hypermutation.\\" As a result, mutations can occur in genes conferring antibiotic resistance, increasing the acquisition of resistance to antibiotics. Almost all of the work on the SOS response has been on bacteria exposed to stressors in vitro. In this study, we sought to quantitate the effects of SOS-inducing drugs in vivo, in comparison with the same drugs in vitro. We used a rabbit model of intestinal infection with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strain E22. SOS-inducing drugs triggered the mutator phenotype response in vivo as well as in vitro. Exposure of E. coli strain E22 to ciprofloxacin or zidovudine, both of which induce the SOS response in vitro, resulted in increased antibiotic resistance to 3 antibiotics: rifampin, minocycline, and fosfomycin. Zinc was able to inhibit the SOS-induced emergence of antibiotic resistance in vivo, as previously observed in vitro.

CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old woman with a past medical history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission while on maintenance therapy with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing over 12 weeks and persistently tested seronegative for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. During this time, the patient experienced waxing and waning of symptoms, which included fever, myalgia, and non-productive cough, but never acquired severe respiratory distress. She was admitted to our hospital on illness day 88, and her symptoms resolved after the administration of convalescent plasma. CONCLUSIONS: As the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, we can currently only speculate about the occurrence of chronic infection vs. reinfection. The protective role of antibodies and their longevity against SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear.

Our aim was to explore variability patterns of fasting blood glucose to test phenotypic decanalization as a possible explanation of heightened prevalence for type 2 diabetes in some groups and to detect variables associated with its variance using a nation-wide survey of Argentinian adult population. We found patterns of higher local variance for fasting glycemia associated with lower income and educational attainment. We detected no meaningful association of glycemia or its variability with covariates related to individual behaviors (diet, physical activity, salt or alcohol consumption).

METHODS Fifty-four patients scheduled to receive general anesthesia by orotracheal intubation were eligible for inclusion in the study with informed consent. After confirmation of proper head positioning depending on the group, the view of the vocal cord was acquired in each position.

Data evaluating agents with potential antiviral activity continue to expand, such that updated guidance is needed regarding use of these agents in children. METHODS: A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 20 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: Given the typically mild course of COVID-19 in children, supportive care alone is suggested for most cases. For children with severe illness, defined as a supplemental oxygen requirement without need for non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), remdesivir is suggested, preferably as part of a clinical trial if available. Remdesivir should also be considered for critically ill children requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. A duration of 5 days is appropriate for most patients. The panel recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir (or other protease inhibitors) for COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients. For children with severe or critical disease, this guidance offers an approach for decision-making regarding use of remdesivir.","output":"Multicenter interim guidance on use of antivirals for children with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several studies have hypothesised that dietary habits may play an important role in COVID-19 infection, severity of symptoms, and duration of illness. However, no previous studies have investigated the association between dietary patterns and COVID-19. METHODS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) from six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, USA) with substantial exposure to COVID-19 patients completed a web-based survey from 17 July to 25 September 2020. Participants provided information on demographic characteristics, dietary information, and COVID-19 outcomes. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association between self-reported diets and COVID-19 infection, severity, and duration. RESULTS: There were 568 COVID-19 cases and 2316 controls. Among the 568 cases, 138 individuals had moderate-to-severe COVID-19 severity whereas 430 individuals had very mild to mild COVID-19 severity. After adjusting for important confounders, participants who reported following plant-based diets and plant-based diets or pescatarian diets had 73% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.81) and 59% (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99) lower odds of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 severity, respectively, compared with participants who did not follow these diets. Compared with participants who reported following plant-based diets, those who reported following low carbohydrate, high protein diets had greater odds of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.13 to 13.24). No association was observed between self-reported diets and COVID-19 infection or duration.

METHODS: Between April 15 and May 1, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted, using online questionnaire, answered by HCWs in a tertiary university hospital. RESULTS: The increase in general hand-skin problems during the pandemic period was statistically significant (P = .004). The most common symptom was dryness. During the pandemic period, 67 (24.3%) HCWs thought that the conditions were caused by glove use, and 197 (71.4%) thought that they were due to alcohol-based hand antiseptics.

For years, the only approach to treatment was thyroidectomy. Active surveillance (AS) has recently emerged as an alternative approach; it involves regular observation aimed at recognizing the minority of patients who will clinically progress and would likely benefit from rescue surgery. To better clarify the indications for active surveillance for low-risk thyroid cancers, we reviewed the current management of low-risk DTCs with a systematic search performed according to a PRISMA flowchart in electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE) for studies published before May 2021. Fourteen publications were included for final analysis, with a total number of 4830 patients under AS. A total of 451/4830 (9.4%) patients experienced an increase in maximum diameter by >3 mm; 609/4830 (12.6%) patients underwent delayed surgery after AS; metastatic spread to cervical lymph nodes was present in 88/4213 (2.1%) patients; 4/3589 (0.1%) patients had metastatic disease outside of cervical lymph nodes. Finally, no subject had a documented mortality due to thyroid cancer during AS. Currently, the American Thyroid Association guidelines do not support AS as the first-line treatment in patients with PMC; however, they consider AS to be an effective alternative, particularly in patients with high surgical risk or poor life expectancy due to comorbid conditions. Thus, AS could be an alternative to immediate surgery for patients with very-low-risk tumors showing no cytologic evidence of aggressive disease, for high-risk surgical candidates, for those with concurrent comorbidities requiring urgent intervention, and for patients with a relatively short life expectancy.","output":"Management of Low-Risk Thyroid Cancers: Is Active Surveillance a Valid Option?

Many children faced milestones such as transition to secondary school having missed several months of face-to-face schooling in the previous academic years. Methods This paper examines change in mental health difficulties, life satisfaction, school connectedness, and feelings about transition to secondary school among 10C11-year-olds in Wales, UK, using data from repeat cross-sectional surveys before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 4032 10C11-year-old schoolchildren. The first cohort completed a school-based survey in 2019 (prior to introduction of social distancing measures), and the second in 2021 (following full return to school after two rounds of school closure). Results The percentage of children reporting elevated emotional difficulties rose from 17% in 2019 to 27% in 2021 (Odds Ratio = 1.65;95%CI = 1.23 to 2.20). There was no evidence of increased behavioural difficulties (OR = 1.04;95%CI = 0.73 to 1.46). There was a tendency toward declines in life satisfaction in all analyses, but this intersected the null (OR = 0.86;95%CI = 0.70 to 1.07). Children reported a high degree of school connectedness before and after the pandemic, with no evidence of change in ratings of teacher relationships, pupil relationships or pupil involvement in school life. There was no evidence of impacts of the pandemic on childrens feelings about the transition to secondary school, with feelings becoming more positive as transition neared. Most findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Supporting childrens emotional recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health priority requiring urgent and effective action at multiple levels of society. Maintaining connectedness to school through the pandemic may have played a role in preventing a steeper increase in child mental health difficulties.

Identifying groups in Asian societies who oppose CVCs and understanding their reasons are necessary steps towards addressing public concerns and formulating an effective CVCs policy in the region. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from June to October 2021 across nine countries in Asia. Multivariable logistical regression analyses were performed to identify potential opposers of CVCs. Findings: Six groups of people were identified as potential opposers of CVCs: (i) those unvaccinated (OR: 201, 95% CI 165 - 246), especially those who are hesitant and have no access to COVID-19 vaccines, (ii) those who do not want existing NPIs to continue (OR: 297, 95% CI: 251 - 353), (iii) those who have low level of trust in governments (OR: 125, 95% CI: 102 - 252), (iv) those with no travel plans (OR: 158, 95% CI: 131 - 190), (v) those who expect no personal financial gains from CVCs (OR: 235, 95% CI: 198 - 278), and (vi) those who disagree with using CVCs for employment, education, events, hospitality, and domestic travel. Interpretation: Addressing recurring public health bottlenecks such as vaccine access and hesitancy, adherence to policies, and public trust, and changing the narrative from societal-benefit to personal-benefit may be necessary and help increase wider adoption of CVCs in Asia.

IL-27 functions through IL-27R and has been shown to have potent antitumor activity via activation of a variety of cellular components, including antitumor CD8(+) T-cell responses. However, the exact mechanisms of how IL-27 enhances antitumor CD8(+) T-cell responses remain unclear. Here we show that IL-27 significantly enhances the survival of activated tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo, and programs tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells into memory precursor-like effector cells, characterized by upregulation of Bcl-6, SOCS3, Sca-1, and IL-10. While STAT3 activation and the CTL survival-enhancing effects can be independent of CTL IL-10 production, we show here that IL-27-induced CTL IL-10 production contributes to memory precursor cell phenotype induction, CTL memory, and tumor rejection. Thus, IL-27 enhances antitumor CTL responses via programming tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells into a unique memory precursor type of effector cells characterized by a greater survival advantage.

To characterize exposures to vape shop workers, especially to flavoring chemicals associated with known respiratory toxicity, this study recruited vape shops from the San Francisco Bay Area. In six shops, air concentrations were measured for volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, flavoring chemicals, and nicotine in personal and/or area samples; analyzed components of e-liquids vaped during field visits; and assessed metals on surface wipe samples. Interviews and observations were conducted over the course of a workday in the same six shops and performed interviews only in an additional six where sampling was not conducted. Detections of the alpha-diketone butter flavoring chemicals diacetyl and/or 2,3-pentanedione were common: in the headspace of purchased e-liquids (18 of 26 samples), in personal air samples (five of 16), and in area air samples (two of six shops). Two exceedances of recommended exposure limits for 2,3-pentanedione (a short-term exposure limit and an eight-hour time weighted average) were measured in personal air samples. Other compounds detected in area and personal air samples included substitutes for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione (acetoin and 2,3-hexanedione) and compounds that may be contaminants or impurities. Furthermore, a large variety (82) of other flavoring chemicals were detected in area air samples. None of the 12 shops interviewed had a health and safety program. Six shops reported no use of any personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gloves, chemical resistant aprons, eye protection) and the others stated occasional use; however, no PPE use was observed during any field investigation day. Recommendations were provided to shops that included making improvements to ventilation, hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, and, if possible, avoidance of products containing the alpha-diketone flavoring chemicals. Future research is needed to evaluate the long-term health risks among workers in the vape shop retail industry and for e-cigarette use generally.

This study, therefore, evaluated the potential of vetiver cultivation under soilless high-pressure aeroponics (HPA) for volatile organic compound (VOC) production. The VOC accumulation in the roots was investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and the composition of these VOCs was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) after sampling by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). The HPA-grown plants were compared to plants that had been grown in potting soil and under axenic conditions. The HPA-grown plants were stunted, demonstrating less root biomass than the plants that had been grown in potting soil. The roots were slender, thinner, more tapered, and lacked the typical vetiver fragrance. HPA cultivation massively impaired the accumulation of the less-volatile hydrocarbon and oxygenated sesquiterpenes that normally form most of the VOCs. The axenic, tissue-cultured plants followed a similar and more exacerbated trend. Ultrastructural analyses revealed that the HPA conditions altered root ontogeny, whereby the roots contained fewer EO-accumulating cells and hosted fewer and more immature intracellular EO droplets. These preliminary results allowed to conclude that HPA-cultivated vetiver suffers from altered development and root ontology disorders that prevent EO accumulation.","output":"Evaluation of Vetiver Volatile Compound Production under Aeroponic-Grown Conditions for the Perfume Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored the feasibility of collecting convalescent plasma for passive immunotherapy of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection by using ELISA to screen serum samples from 443 potential plasma donors: 196 patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection, 230 healthcare workers, and 17 household contacts exposed to MERS-CoV.

METHODS: Data were collected on 47 patients who underwent day-case skin-sparing (SSM) or nipple-sparing (NSM) mastectomy with pre-pectoral IBR between October 2017 and September 2019. Clinicopathological data were collected, including postoperative complications, re-admission and re-operation. The data were compared to published national standards. RESULTS: Median age was 52 years (range 37-74). Thirty-two patients (68%) had an SSM and 15 (32%) had an NSM. Two patients (4%) had risk-reducing mastectomies and 45 had treatment for invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Mean tumour size was 33.3mm (range 7-85mm). Forty-two (89%) patients went home on the day of surgery. No patients required re-operation in the first 48 hours. The median postoperative follow-up time was 11.4 months (range 1.8-22.7 months).

Due to its relapsing nature, addiction is difficult to treat, as individuals can relapse following even long periods of abstinence and, it is during this time, that they are most vulnerable to overdose. In America, opioid overdose has been increasing for decades, making finding new treatments to help patients remain abstinent and prevent overdose deaths imperative. Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have shown promise in reducing motivated behaviours for drugs of abuse. In this study, we test the effectiveness of the GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide (LIR), in reducing heroin addiction-like behaviour, and the potential side effects associated with the treatment. We show that daily treatment with LIR (0.1 mg/kg sc) increases the latency to take heroin, reduces heroin self-administration, prevents escalation of heroin self-administration and reduces drug-induced reinstatement of heroin-seeking behaviour in rats. A 1-h pretreatment time, however, was too short to reduce cue-induced seeking in our study. Moreover, we showed that, while LIR (0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0 mg/kg sc) supported conditioned taste avoidance of a LIR-paired saccharin cue, it did not elicit intake of the antiemetic kaolin in heroin-na?ve or heroin-experienced rats. Further, 0.1 mg/kg LIR did not produce great disruptions in food intake or body weight. Overall, the data show that LIR is effective in reducing heroin taking and heroin seeking at doses that do not cause malaise and have a modest effect on food intake and body weight gain.","output":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, reduces heroin self-administration and drug-induced reinstatement of heroin-seeking behaviour in rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the heath measures taken during the outbreak of Covid-19, the lack of educational methods has become the primary concern among educational professionals who have been using technology as a motivational tool.

COVID-19 admissions peaked in the second half of March, a period characterized by an extremely high mortality rate (27.4%). The number of admissions in 2020 was similar to 2019, but COVID-19 patients gradually occupied all available beds. Comparison between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 admissions in 2020 revealed significant differences concerning all age classes and gender. Specifically, COVID-19 patients were older, predominantly male, and exhibited more comorbidities. Overall, admissions for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in 2020 vs. 2019 dropped by approximately one third. Statistically significant reductions were observed for acute myocardial infarction (-78, -33.9%), cerebrovascular disease (-235, -41.5%), and cancer (-368, -31.9%). While the first two appeared equally distributed between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, chronic NCDs were statistically significantly more frequent in the former, except cancer, which was less frequent in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of collateral damage to patients with other diseases should be an integral part of epidemic response plans. Prospective cohort studies are needed to understand the long-term impact.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Hospital Admissions for Non-Communicable Diseases in a Large Italian University-Hospital: A Descriptive Case-Series Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) face challenges that impact their quality of life across multiple domains. This prospective study aims to identify a hierarchy of preferred outcomes by ranking nine domains of recovery, over the period of six months post discharge among patients and their caregivers. METHODS: This is a single-center companion study to the multi-center APICS (Addressing Post Intensive Care Syndrome) study. This protocol has been expanded to enroll a maximum of 80 patient-caregiver dyads at BIDMC including a subset of COVID positive patients. Eligible patients are those who meet ARF criteria in the ICUs at BIDMC for at least 24 hours and are expected to be discharged home are recruited. Patients and caregivers participate in a survey in which they rank 9 aspects of recovery from critical illness from being most important (1) to least important (9). Patients also participate in the MOCA/MOCA-blind questionnaire at baseline and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: This study is actively enrolling. To date, we have enrolled 21 patients and 5 caregivers. At discharge, 43% of patients ranked survival as most important, while 24% ranked cognitive function as most important. 80% of caregivers ranked survival as most important at discharge. Survival remained the highest priority for patients at 6 months followed by physical, cognitive and pulmonary recovery respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both survivors and caregivers valued survival as the most important construct of recovery. Cognitive function followed survival as the second most important construct.

Therefore, our study aims to investigate the risk of developing alopecia areata (AA) among COVID-19 patients in South Korea using adequate control based on national representative data. METHODS: We used the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) COVID\\\\19 cohort database, comprising COVID\\\\19 patient and control group, all of whom were diagnosed from January 1, 2020 to June 4, 2020. Patients were defined as individuals who were confirmed as COVID\\\\19 positive, regardless of disease severity. Controls were defined as whom confirmed as COVID\\\\19 negative. People with a history of AA during the period 2015C2019 were excluded. The primary endpoint was a new diagnosis of AA (ICD-10-CM-Code: L63). Adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of developing AA was estimated using log-link Poisson regression model based on incidence density of case and control group. The model adjusted for (1) age and sex (2) demographic variables (age, sex, place of residence, and income level). Statistical significance was set at p< 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 226,737 individuals (7,958 [3.5%] cases and 218,779 [96.5%] controls) were included in the final analysis. There were more females than males, both in test positives and negatives at 59.9% and 52.3%, respectively. The largest test positive population was those in age group 20 to 29 years (25.5%),.

Objective: To quantify how these lockdowns changed the spoken communication environments of children with cochlear implants by comparing the sounds they were exposed to before the Ontario provincial state of emergency in March 2020 and during the resulting closures of schools and nonessential businesses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This experimental cohort study comprised children with hearing loss who used cochlear implants to hear. These children were chosen because (1) their devices monitor and catalog levels and types of sounds during hourly use per day (datalogs), and (2) this group is particularly vulnerable to reduced sound exposure. Children were recruited from the Cochlear Implant Program at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Ontario, Canada. Children whose cochlear implant datalogs were captured between February 1 and March 16, 2020, shortly before lockdown (pre-COVID-19), were identified. Repeated measures were collected in 45 children during initial easing of lockdown restrictions (stages 1-2 of the provincial recovery plan); resulting datalogs encompassed the lockdown period (peri-COVID-19). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hours of sound captured by the Cochlear Nucleus datalogging system (Cochlear Corporation) in 6 categories of input levels (<40, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, &#8805;80 A-weighted dB sound pressure levels [dBA]) and 6 auditory scene categories (quiet, speech, speech-in-noise, music, noise, and other). Mixed-model regression analyses revealed main effects with post hoc adjustment of confidence intervals using the Satterthwaite method. Results: A total of 45 children (mean [SD] age, 7.7 [5.0] years; 23 girls [51.1%]) participated in this cohort study. Results showed similar daily use of cochlear implants during the pre- and peri-COVID-19 periods (9.80 mean hours pre-COVID-19 and 9.34 mean hours peri-COVID-19). Despite consistent device use, these children experienced significant quieting of input sound levels peri-COVID-19 by 0.49 hour (95% CI, 0.21-0.80 hour) at 60 to 69 dBA and 1.70 hours (95% CI, 1.42-1.99 hours) at 70 to 79 dBA with clear reductions in speech exposure by 0.98 hour (95% CI, 0.49-1.47 hours). This outcome translated into a reduction of speech:quiet from 1.6:1.0 pre-COVID-19 to 0.9:1.0 during lockdowns. The greatest reductions in percentage of daily speech occurred in school-aged children (elementary, 12.32% [95% CI, 7.15%-17.49%]; middle school, 11.76% [95% CI, 5.00%-18.52%]; and high school, 9.60% [95% CI, 3.27%-15.93%]). Increased daily percentage of quiet (7.00% [95% CI, 4.27%-9.74%]) was most prevalent for children who had fewer numbers of people in their household (estimate [SE] = -1.12% [0.50%] per person; Cohen f = 0.31).

To prevent transmission of influenza from healthcare workers (HCWs) to patients, many hospitals exclude febrile HCWs from working, but allow afebrile HCWs with respiratory symptoms to have contact with patients. During the 2013C2014 influenza season at our hospital, an influenza-positive HCW with respiratory symptoms but no fever was linked to a case of possible healthcare-associated influenza in a patient. Therefore, we implemented a temporary policy of mandatory influenza testing for HCWs with respiratory symptoms. Methods. From 3 January through 28 February 2014, we tested HCWs with respiratory symptoms for influenza and other respiratory pathogens by polymerase chain reaction of flocked nasopharyngeal swabs. HCWs also reported symptoms and influenza vaccination status, and underwent temperature measurement. We calculated the proportion of influenza-positive HCWs with fever and prior influenza vaccination. Results. Of 449 HCWs, 243 (54%) had a positive test for any respiratory pathogen; 34 (7.6%) HCWs tested positive for influenza. An additional 7 HCWs were diagnosed with influenza by outside physicians. Twenty-one (51.2%) employees with influenza had fever. Among influenza-infected HCWs, 20 had previously received influenza vaccination, 18 had declined the vaccine, and 3 had unknown vaccination status. There was no significant difference in febrile disease among influenza-infected employees who had received the influenza vaccine and those who had not received the vaccine (45% vs 61%; P = .32).

This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patient. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per m3 of air were pooled and their distribution were described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or TCID50 per m3 were analysed after categorization of sizes in <1 micrometers, 1-4 micrometers, and >4 micrometers. Results Among 2,034 records identified, 17 articles were included in the review. Overall, 27.5% (68/247) of air sampled from close patients environment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, without difference according to the setting (ICU: 27/97, 27.8%; non-ICU: 41/150, 27.3%; p=0.93), the distance from patients (<1 meter: 1/64, 1.5%; 1-5 meters: 4/67, 6%; p=0.4).

Parasite accumulation is primarily mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). Magnitude of IgG to pRBCs has been associated with reduced risk of MiP in some studies, but associations have been inconsistent. Further, antibody effector mechanisms are poorly understood, and the role of antibody complement interactions is unknown. METHODS Studying a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women (n=302) from a malaria-endemic province in Papua New Guinea (PNG), we measured the ability of antibodies to fix and activate complement using placental binding pRBCs and PfEMP1 recombinant domains. We determined antibody-mediated complement inhibition of pRBC binding to the placental receptor, chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), and associations with protection against placental parasitemia. RESULTS Some women acquired antibodies that effectively promoted complement fixation on placental-binding pRBCs. Complement fixation correlated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, which dominated the response. There was, however, limited evidence for membrane attack complex activity or pRBC lysis or killing. Importantly, a higher magnitude of complement fixing antibodies was prospectively associated with reduced odds of placental infection at delivery. Using genetically modified P. falciparum and recombinant PfEMP1 domains, we found that complement-fixing antibodies primarily targeted a specific variant of PfEMP1 (known as VAR2CSA). Furthermore, complement enhanced the ability of antibodies to inhibit pRBC binding to CSA, which was primarily mediated by complement C1q protein. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide new insights into mechanisms mediating immunity to MiP and reveal potential new strategies for developing malaria vaccines that harness antibody-complement interactions.","output":"Reduced risk of placental parasitemia associated with complement fixation on Plasmodium falciparum by antibodies among pregnant women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a worldwide outbreak, with significant molecular evolution over time.

Methods: Following three pandemic waves from March 2020 to the end of May 2021, we analysed a dataset of 19,994 sequences divided into B.1.1.7|Alpha and non-Alpha lineage groups. We performed phylogeographic analyses using the discrete diffusion models to identify the pathways of virus spread. Results: Based on population dynamics inferences, in total, 673 lineage introductions (95% HPD interval 641C712) for non-Alpha and 618 (95% HPD interval 599C639) for B.1.1.7|Alpha were identified in the area. For non-Alpha lineages, 5.05% binational, 86.63% exclusively German, and 8.32% Polish clusters were found, with a higher frequency of international clustering observed for B.1.1.7|Alpha (13.11% for binational, 68.44% German and 18.45% Polish, p < 0.001). We identified key transmission hubs for the analysed lineages, namely Saxony, West Pomerania and Lower Silesia.

Operationalization of the One Health approach is still unclear for various local health systems with their respective targets. In this scenario, the empirical study of intersectoral collaboration between the human and animal health systems provides an opportunity to investigate the appropriate strategies and their enabling factors at the local health system level. Thus, this study documented and validated the innovative strategy for intersectoral collaboration, focusing on effectual prevention and control of zoonotic diseases with its enabling factors for a city in western India, Ahmedabad. METHODS: This case study was conducted in three phases: phase I (qualitative data collection, i.e., vignette interview), phase II (quantitative data collection through modified policy Delphi), and phase III (participatory workshop). The vignette data were handled for content analysis, and the Delphi data, like other quantitative data, for descriptive statistics. The participatory workshop adapts the computerized Sensitivity Model(?) developed by Vester to analyse the health system dynamics. RESULT: Out of the possible 36 strategies, this study validated the top 15 essential (must-have) and five preferred (should-have) strategies for the study area. For operationalization of the One Health approach, the enabling factors that were identified through the systems approach are micro-level factors at the individual level (trust, leadership, motivation, knowledge), meso-level factors at the organizational level (human resource, capacity-building, shared vision, decision-making capacity, laboratory capacity, surveillance), macro-level factors at the system level (coordinated roles, relationships, common platform), and external factors outside of the system (guidelines/policies, community participation, a specific budget, political will, smart technology). DISCUSSION: This study reveals that the micro-level factors at the individual level are potential levers of the health system. More attention to these factors could be beneficial for the operationalization of the One Health approach. This study recommends a systems approach through a bottom-up exploration to understand the local health system and its enabling factors, which should be accounted for in formulating future One Health policies.

After drawing people in with misleading advertisements, for-profit colleges quickly hand prospective students off to financial aid officers who rush students through the process of explaining the financial aid systemif they explain it at all. These employees drive students to take on massive federal and private debt loads, including loans that the school itself originates. They will sometimes fill out or even fraudulently sign forms on students behalf, all the while insisting that they are working in the students interest. Each of these tactics has one goal: boosting schools revenues by inflating students debt balances, regardless of how unmanageable those loans are likely to be for borrowers.This issue brief argues that each of these areas of conduct place for-profit colleges squarely within the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and that the Bureau can therefore intervene to protect borrowers. The CFPBs authorizing statute states that anyone providing a consumer financial product or service is a covered person and therefore falls under the Bureaus purview, including with respect to the prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. As this issue brief outlines, each one of the common features of the for-profit college business model described above is alone sufficient to make a for-profit college a covered person, including the practices of lending to students through institutional loan programs, brokering student loans through third parties, and providing students financial advisory services in the financial aid process (regardless of the quality of the advice).With for-profit college enrollment surging due to COVID, the need to rein in the industry has never been more pressing.

In this study, we assessed the understanding of osteoporosis treatment and its risk in dental professionals pre and post an education lecture. Method: Dental professionals were invited to an educational lecture on osteoporosis treatment and benefits. 2 lectures were conducted over the course of a year, with the 2(nd) lecture conducted virtually due to physical meeting restrictions in place for the COVID 19 pandemic. Attendees were invited to submit responses to a pre- and post- lecture survey assessing their knowledge of the current osteoporosis treatments and MRONJ. Results: There were 126 responses to the survey conducted. Majority (87%) of responders were dentists in private, including group dental practices, with 74% having more than 11 years of working experience. Most (81 %) have not had any encounters with patients with MRONJ. The pre-lecture survey showed that 60% of responders expressed slight or no confidence at all in treating patients who are on osteoporosis treatment. Only 19% of all responders were able to correctly identify the risk of MRONJ in patients on osteoporosis treatment. Majority of responders tended to inflate MRONJ risk by as much as 100 times the quoted baseline risk in the literature. One third of dentists would not perform any invasive treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. Post-lecture, the percentage of responders with slight and no confidence at all in treating patients who are on osteoporosis treatment decreased to 18%. 65% of responders were able to correctly identify the risk of MRONJ in patients on osteoporosis treatment as quoted in the literature. Only 3% of dentists would not perform any invasive treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. 95% of responders correctly stated that maintenance of good oral hygiene is the most important measure to prevent MRONJ. Attendees suggested the creation of a joint guidance from local osteoporosis and dental societies may better improve knowledge and instill confidence in treating osteoporosis patients. Conclusion: There is a significant knowledge gap within the dental practitioners in Singapore on the risk of MRONJ associated with osteoporosis treatments. This may result in dentists discouraging patients from starting osteoporosis medications and dentists not performing necessary dental treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. Both physical and virtual dental education lectures are effective in increasing the level of confidence and in correcting misconceptions on MRONJ risk. Continued engagement of the dental community would be important in reducing fear of MRONJ and facilitate treatment of osteoporosis in the population.","output":"Improving Knowledge of MRONJ Risk Among Singapore Dental Practitioners Using an Educational Lecture With an Incorporated Quiz"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to discuss, in the context of the pandemic, the relationship between the climate crisis, transformations of work, and the reorganization of cities It is based on the idea that the pandemic is a result of the climate crisis whose end cannot be envisioned without reconfiguring urban spaces and rethinking inequalities in order to think about different social forms that reconcile green, healthy, and more egalitarian cities ? 2021 University of Toronto All rights reserved","output":"Aprs la pandmie: Transformations des villes, du travail, et la crise climatique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postoperative follow-up after urogynaecological surgery has been little investigated.

However, the direct use of existing vision transformer that uses the corpus generated by the ResNet is not optimal for correct feature embedding. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel vision Transformer by using the low-level CXR feature corpus that are obtained to extract the abnormal CXR features. Specifically, the backbone network is trained using large public datasets to obtain the abnormal features in routine diagnosis such as consolidation, glass-grass opacity (GGO), etc. Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpus for vision transformer training.

Within seconds of activation, they release various preformed biologically active products and initiate the process of de novo synthesis of cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators. This process is regulated at multiple levels. Besides the extensively studied IgE and IgG receptors, toll-like receptors, MRGPR, and other protein receptor signaling pathways, there is a critical activation pathway based on cholesterol-dependent, pore-forming cytolytic exotoxins produced by Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. This pathway is initiated by binding the exotoxins to the cholesterol-rich membrane, followed by their dimerization, multimerization, pre-pore formation, and pore formation. At low sublytic concentrations, the exotoxins induce mast cell activation, including degranulation, intracellular calcium concentration changes, and transcriptional activation, resulting in production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Higher toxin concentrations lead to cell death. Similar activation events are observed when mast cells are exposed to sublytic concentrations of saponins or some other compounds interfering with the membrane integrity. We review the molecular mechanisms of mast cell activation by pore-forming bacterial exotoxins, and other compounds inducing cholesterol-dependent plasma membrane perturbations.

The results can strongly support the development of policies and legislation regarding animal-friendly production. In China, the demand for animal-friendly products is increasing, but so far, the research on the relationship between the knowledge of animal welfare and animal-friendly consuming intentions is limited. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the knowledge of animal welfare on consumers behavioral intentions and its mechanism. The survey covered 1499 food consumers in Guangdong province, China. Our empirical results suggest that increasing knowledge of animal welfare is significantly positive for the intention of animal-friendly products consumption. Furthermore, empathy moderates the indirect effect between animal-friendly product cognition and the behavioral intention both to purchase and recommend. ABSTRACT: As purchase power and consumption knowledge increase, consumers gradually demand safer and healthier products. Animal welfare is expected to be an important attribute of high-end food in the future and a major concern for the high-quality development of the livestock industry. The objective was to shed new light on our understanding of consumers perceptions and behavioral intentions toward animal-friendly food. Using sample data of 1499 food consumers in Guangdong province, China, this study explored the role of product cognition and empathy in the relationship between consumers knowledge and behavioral intentions. Results indicate that knowledge of animal welfare significantly influences consumers behavioral intentions, and there is a mediating effect on cognition. Meanwhile, empathy moderates the relationship between product cognition and consumers intentions to purchase or recommend animal-friendly products. Improving consumers knowledge of animal welfare and cognitive levels of animal-friendly products may contribute to promoting animal-friendly product consumption and sustainable development of the livestock industry.","output":"Knowledge of Animal Welfare and Consumers Behavioral Intentions in China: A Moderated Mediation Model of Product Cognition and Empathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced major changes in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Limited information on the underlying immune mechanisms that drive disease or protection during COVID-19 severely hamper development of therapeutics and vaccines. Thus, the establishment of relevant animal models that mimic the pathobiology of the disease is urgent. Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit disease pathobiology similar to human COVID-19, thus serving as a relevant animal model. In the current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of juvenile and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that genes associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways are significantly induced in macaque infected lungs, while pathways associated with collagen formation are downregulated. In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor prognosis and increased mortality. We demonstrate that Type I IFN and Notch signaling pathways are significantly upregulated in lungs of juvenile infected macaques when compared with old infected macaques. These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease. In contrast, pathways involving VEGF are downregulated in lungs of old infected macaques. Using samples from humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, we validate a subset of our findings. Finally, neutrophil degranulation, innate immune system and IFN gamma signaling pathways are upregulated in both tuberculosis and COVID-19, two pulmonary diseases where neutrophils are associated with increased severity.

METHODS: Five imported malaria cases in travellers returning to the UK and RoI from East Africa were reported to the PHE Malaria Reference Laboratory as negative according to histidine-rich protein (HRP2)-RDT. The cases were systematically investigated using microscopic, RDT, molecular, genomic, and in in vitro approaches. RESULTS: In each case, HRP2-RDT was negative, whereas microscopy confirmed the presence of P. falciparum. Further analysis revealed that the genes encoding HRP2 and HRP3 were deleted in three of the five cases. Whole-genome sequencing in one of these isolates confirmed deletions in P. falciparum chromosomes 8 and 13. Our study produced evidence that the fourth case, which had high parasitemia at clinical presentation, was a rare example of antigen saturation (prozone-like effect), leading to a false negative in the HRP2-RDT, while the fifth case was due to low parasitemia. CONCLUSIONS: False-negative HRP2-RDT results with P. falciparum are concerning. Our findings emphasise the necessity of supporting the interpretation of RDT results with microscopy, in conjunction with clinical observations, and sets out a systematic approach to identifying parasites carrying pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions.","output":"Failure of rapid diagnostic tests in Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases among travelers to the UK and Ireland: Identification and characterisation of the parasites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus pandemic, telecommuting is widely required, making remote data access grow significantly. This requires highly reliable data storage solutions. Storage area networks (SANs) are one of such solutions. To guarantee that SANs can deliver the desired quality of service, cascading failures must be prevented, which occur when a single initial incident triggers a cascade of unexpected failures of other devices. One such incident is the data loading/overloading, causing the malfunction of one device and further cascading failures. Thus, it is crucial to address influence of data loading on the SAN reliability modeling and analysis. In this work, we make contributions by modeling the effects of data loading on the reliability of an individual switch device in SANs though the proportional-hazards model and accelerated failure-time model. Effects of loading on the reliability of the entire SAN are further investigated through dynamic fault trees and binary decision diagrams-based analysis of a mesh SAN system.","output":"Influence of Load on Reliability of Storage Area Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveThis study examined the relationship between support for workers with illness and work functioning impairment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The improved wired and guided network infrastructure along with the emerging 5G networks enables the provisioning of increased bandwidth support while the virtualization introduced by the integration of Software Defined Networks (SDN) enables traffic management and remote orchestration of networking devices. However, the popularity and variety of multimedia-rich applications along with the increased number of users has led to an ever increasing pressure that these multimedia-rich content applications are placing on the underlying networks. Consequently, a simple increase in the system capacity will not be enough and an intelligent traffic management solution is required to enable the Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning. In this context, this paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework within a multimedia-based SDN environment, that decides on the most suitable routing algorithm to be applied on the QoS-based traffic flows to improve QoS provisioning. The proposed RL-based solution was implemented and evaluated using an experimental setup under a realistic SDN environment and compared against other state-of-the-art solutions from the literature in terms of throughput, packet loss, latency, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean opinion score (MOS).

However, there is a lack of evidence on substance use among HCWs in Latin America. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the current frequency of substance use among Latin American among HCWs. METHODS: We searched 8 databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScientDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scielo, LILACS and Latindex), 4 public prepublication servers (SocArXiv, medRxiv, bioRxiv and Preprints) and Google scholar from 1/9/2019 to 11/1/2021. We determined the frequency of each study based on original studies, scientific letters, and clinical trials in English, Spanish and Portuguese. RESULTS: A total of 17 175 study articles were identified from electronic databases and preprints, and 2 cross-sectional studies conducted in 2020 were included in the qualitative analysis. Both studies included HCWs but did not perform a differential analysis. The first was developed by the Pan-American Health Organization and included interviewees from 35 countries, while the second was conducted with 1145 Brazilian participants. Both studies showed increases in substance use during the pandemic, with alcohol being the most commonly used substance (30%), but PAHOs study reported a 13.8% increase in self-reported heavy-episodic drinking, with differences among genders (males, 15.4%), age groups (highest increase in the 40-49 age group, 16.5%) and area of residence (urban with 14%). The second study showed that 21 32% of participants reported initiating psychoactive substance use, 29.3% added some substance to their initial use and 4% of them had to replace the substance, mainly due to difficulty of access. Other substances of abuse that showed significant increases were tobacco (0.5%) and marijuana (0.3%). CONCLUSION: Overall, despite the analysis of the 2 studies, the results provided are not a conclusive description of the frequency of substance use by HCWs in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of COVID-19 because of their profession. There are limited studies conducted in Ethiopia among HCWs regarding their compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Therefore, this study intended to assess HCWs' compliance with measures to prevent COVID-19, and its potential determinants in public hospitals in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A self-administered, multicenter hospital-based cross-sectional survey was proposed to 422 randomly selected HCWs working in seven public hospitals in Western Ethiopia identified as COVID-19 referral centers. Data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 24. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential determinants of outcome variables at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 422 completed questionnaires, the overall HCWs' compliance with COVID-19 prevention is 22% (n = 404). In multivariate regression analysis, factors such as spending most of caring time at bedside (AOR = 1.94, 95%CI, 1.06-3.55), receiving training on infection prevention/COVID-19 (AOR = 1.86, 95%CI, 1.04-3.33), reading materials on COVID-19 (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI, 1.14-3.63) and having support from hospital management (AOR = 2.09, 95%CI, 1.20-3.64) were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 preventive measures. Furthermore, inadequate supplies of appropriate personal protective equipment (83.2%), insufficient supportive medications (78.5%), and lack of provision of adequate ventilation (77.7%) were the barriers to COVID-19 prevention most frequently mentioned by participants. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight HCWs' poor compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures.

TeleKidSeq is a pilot study that emerged from the NYCKidSeq program, an NIH-funded Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating (CSER) Consortium site focused on incorporating genomic medicine into the care of diverse New York City children with suspected genetic disorders. Embracing the opportunity to study the use of telehealth in delivering genomic results, TeleKidSeq will examine the impact of innovative remote genetic counseling modalities in medically underserved populations. Studies focusing on the use of telehealth performed before the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that patients prefer in-person visits to virtual visits;however, with the increased familiarity and widespread use of virtual platforms, we anticipate an increase in the preference for telehealth visits. TeleKidSeq aims to fill the gaps in current knowledge on the impact of visual aids in telehealth in diverse urban patient populations. Methods: TeleKidSeq will recruit 496 pediatric participants (aged 0-21 years) with neurologic, immunologic, or cardiac conditions suspected to have an underlying genetic cause who receive care predominantly within two large health systems in the New York metropolitan area. The Mount Sinai Genomics Stakeholder Board, consisting of diverse stakeholders and key community advisors, provided guidance about our study design and materials. Participants will be English- or Spanish-speaking, and based on prior enrollment data from NYCKidSeq study, we expect more than 65% will be from populations underrepresented in medical research. Prior to enrollment, participants will be randomized to receive their genomic results from a genetic counselor via telehealth either with screen sharing (ScrS) or without screen sharing (NScrS). All participants will receive genome sequencing (GS) from a clinically validated laboratory. Additionally, we will use GUA, a web-based application designed to enhance the delivery of genomic test results, in both the ScrC and NScrS arms to facilitate delivery of individualized genomic results and clinical information in a personalized, highly visual, and narrative manner. Surveys administered at baseline, after results disclosure, and 6-months post-results disclosure will be used to evaluate study outcomes. The primary outcome of the TeleKidSeq study will be participants perceived understanding of their GS results with a comparison between the results disclosed via videoconferencing with ScrS and NScrS arms. Secondary outcomes will include: objective understanding of GS results;understanding of medical follow-up recommendations and the actionability of genome sequencing results;adherence to medical follow-up recommendations made based on genomic results;and satisfaction with and ease of use of the telehealth experience, compared across the two arms. Diagnostic yield, clinical utility and cost of GS will also be assessed. Results: Not applicable.

The effectiveness of such controls depends largely on public knowledge, attitude, and practices towards this novel virus. The prime objective of this study is to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of university students and graduates in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. For this purpose, cross-sectional data is collected from 1789 participants through an online survey conducted between July 12 and August 10. The survey instrument consists of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 6 items on attitudes, and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Our statistical analyses are based on descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The overall correct response rate of the knowledge section is 73%, which is comparatively lower than similar studies in the region. The majority of participants are optimistic about the successful control of COVID-19 in Pakistan, and following the instructions issued by the government of Pakistan. However, a bulk of participants showed skepticism and no trust in the health facilities of hospitals in Pakistan, which could be the potential explanation of falling confirmed cases in Pakistan. In addition, a low knowledge score is found to be significantly associated with low confidence in successful control of COVID-19, and socially undesirable practices.

We systematically explored the association between the stimulation dosage of cathodal tDCS and induced after-effects on motor cortex excitability in the elderly. METHOD Thirty-nine healthy volunteers in two age groups, namely Pre-Elderly (50-65 years) and Elderly (66-80 years), participated in the study. Ten sessions of cathodal tDCS, with a combination of four intensities (1, 2, 3 mA and sham) and three durations (15, 20, 30 minutes) were conducted over the M1 in each participant. Cortical excitability changes were monitored with TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for up to two hours after stimulation. RESULTS Motor cortex excitability was reduced by cathodal stimulation intensities of 1 and 3mA in both age groups, in accordance with results observed in the younger age groups of previous studies. For the 2mA stimulation condition, an age-dependent conversion of plasticity into a stimulation duration-dependent excitability enhancement was observed in the Pre-Elderly group, whereas in the Elderly group, LTD-like plasticity was preserved, or abolished, depending on stimulation duration. CONCLUSION The LTD-like plasticity effects induced by cathodal tDCS originally described in young adults are also observable in older humans, but non-linearities of the resulting plasticity were partially preserved only in the Pre-Elderly, but not the Elderly group.

RESULTS Challenges identified include a fear of contracting influenza from vaccination exacerbated by negative anecdotes regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, distrust of published efficacy data, uncertainty regarding relevance of existing data for Singapore, reluctance to introduce chemicals or overmedicate, pain from injection, low risk attributed to influenza and limited awareness of influenza transmission with a preference for alternatives in patient protection. Differences in attitudes were observed across vocational groups. Lack of overt promotion by hospital leadership in some institutions, perceived vaccine hesitancy among doctors, access, and work culture that implicitly encourages working through illness were further barriers. CONCLUSION Our findings highlight a combination of misperceptions about influenza vaccination and cognitive biases at the individual level, and challenges at the institutional level limiting uptake. Findings indicate an urgent need to provide targeted education and communication. Rather than providing more data, we recommend a widely-disseminated, locally-compiled synthesis addressing specific concerns of hesitant HCWs. Tailoring interventions to specific vocational groups should be considered. Institutional norms and culture may have a powerful influence in setting default behaviours: more effort is needed in improving influenza vaccine promotion and priority at some institutions, integrating vaccine-related communication with other infection control communication and addressing influenza vaccine hesitancy among doctors as a priority. Finally, further study of strategies to address cognitive biases affecting influenza vaccine acceptance in Singapore is desirable.","output":"\\"I wouldn't really believe statistics\\" - Challenges with influenza vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers in Singapore."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El artculo versa sobre los efectos que tuvo la pandemia en la Argentina y hace un foco especial en las reas de seguridad y defensa;adems sus efectos en la poltica exterior del pas, en vistas del escenario regional y global que enfrenta.

Discontinuation of ART leads to pVL rebound from reservoirs of persistence and latency, and progressive immunodeficiency. One promising but controversial strategy targeting CD4(+) T lymphocytes with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against 47 integrin has shown promise through sustained virological remission of pVL (SVR) in SIV(239)-infected rhesus macaques. We propose to assess the safety and tolerability of vedolizumab, a licensed humanised mAb against human 47 integrin, in healthy HIV-infected adults on ART. This study will also assess, by analytical treatment interruption (ATI), whether vedolizumab treatment can induce SVR beyond ART and vedolizumab treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The HIV-ART-vedolizumab-ATI (HAVARTI) trial is a single-arm, dose-ranging pilot trial in healthy HIV-positive adult volunteers receiving ART. Twelve consenting persons will be enrolled in sequential groups of 4 to each serial dosing vedolizumab regimen (300 mg, 150 mg, 75 mg). The primary outcomes are: (1) to assess the safety and tolerability of seven serial infusions of vedolizumab at each of three doses; (2) to identify the immunovirological measures, including pVL and T-cell kinetics, that characterise HIV/ART cases before, during, after vedolizumab treatment and ATI; and (3) to seek SVR of pVL after ATI. Secondary outcomes will include immune reconstitution and pVL suppression as well as immune reconstitution and long-term safety following re-initiation of ART in the absence of SVR. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network-REB and by the Health Canada Therapeutic Products Directorate. A Data Safety Monitor will review safety information at regular intervals. The final manuscript will be submitted to an open access journal within a year of study completion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-seven subjects with ACL tears (32 females; age 32.6  8.3 years; BMI 24.5  3.5 kg/m2) from a prospective study were screened for the presence of MRLs. Morphological (high-resolution 3D fast spin-echo) and compositional (T1 and T2 mapping) MRI was performed prior to and 2 years after ACL reconstruction. Follow-up MR images were assessed for changes in the signal intensity of the MRLs and the presence of meniscal tears. Differences of compositional parameters were compared between subjects with MRLs and without meniscal lesions using independent samples t tests. RESULTS MRLs were found in 16% (9/56) of the subjects with ACL tears at baseline. Only one subject with MRLs developed a posterior horn meniscal tear over 2 years. In 12 knees, no meniscal tears were found, which were defined as controls. Most interestingly, cartilage ?T1 of the medial femur and medial tibia increased significantly more in subjects with MRLs compared with controls (mean difference, MF = 6.0  0.8 vs. 2.3  0.6, p = 0.004, and MT = 4.4  1.4 vs. 0.4  0.6, p = 0.027) and medial femur ?T2 over 2 years increased significantly more in MRL than in control knees (5.1  2.5 ms vs. 2.2  1.9 ms, p = 0.012).

We describe the characteristics, inclusion rates, and experiences from participating centres according the TeleCheck-AF infrastructure as well as characteristics and experiences from recruited patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three surveys exploring centre characteristics (n = 25), centre experiences (n = 23), and patient experiences (n = 826) were completed. Self-reported patient characteristics were obtained from the app. Most centres were academic (64%) and specialized public cardiology/district hospitals (36%). Majority of the centres had AF outpatient clinics (64%) and only 36% had AF ablation clinics. The time required to start patient inclusion and total number of included patients in the project was comparable for centres experienced (56%) or inexperienced in mHealth use. Within 28 weeks, 1930 AF patients were recruited, mainly for remote AF control (31% of patients) and AF ablation follow-up (42%). Average inclusion rate was highest during the lockdown restrictions and reached a steady state at a lower level after easing the restrictions (188 vs. 52 weekly recruited patients). Majority (>80%) of the centres reported no problems during the implementation of the TeleCheck-AF approach. Recruited patients [median age 64 (55-71), 62% male] agreed that the FibriCheck? app was easy to use (94%).

Health in all policies (HiAP) is an approach that seeks to identify and influence the health and equity impacts of policy decisions, to enhance health benefits and avoid harm. This usually involves the use of health impact assessment or health lens analysis. There is growing international experience in these approaches, and some countries have cross-sectoral governance structures that prioritize the assessment of the policies that are most likely to affect health. The fundamental elements of HiAP are inter-sectoral collaboration, policy influence, and holistic consideration of the range of health determinants affected by a policy area or proposal. HiAP requires public health professionals to invest time to build partnerships and engage meaningfully with the sectors affecting the social determinants of health and health equity. With commitment, political will and tools such as the health impact assessment, it provides a powerful approach to integrated policymaking that promotes health, well-being, and equity. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the profile of public health and highlighted the links between health and other policy areas. This paper describes the rationale for, and principles underpinning, HiAP mechanisms, including HIA, experiences, challenges and opportunities for the future.","output":"Health in All PoliciesA Key Driver for Health and Well-Being in a Post-COVID-19 Pandemic World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Approaches to address unmet mental health care needs in supportive housing settings are needed. Collaborative approaches to delivering psychiatric care have robust evidence in multiple settings, however such approaches have not been adequately studied in housing settings. This study evaluates the implementation of a shifted outpatient collaborative care initiative in which a psychiatrist was added to existing housing, community mental health, and primary care supports in a women-centered supportive housing complex in Toronto, Canada. METHODS: The initiative was designed and implemented by stakeholders from an academic hospital and from community housing and mental health agencies. Program activities comprised multidisciplinary support for tenants (e.g. multidisciplinary care teams, case conferences), tenant engagement (psychoeducation sessions), and staff capacity-building (e.g. formal trainings, informal ad hoc questions). This mixed methods implementation evaluation sought to understand (1) program activity delivery including satisfaction with these activities, (2) consistency with team-based tenant-centered care and with pre-specified shared lenses (trauma-informed, culturally safe, harm reduction), and (3) facilitators and barriers to implementation over a one-year period. Quantitative data included reporting of program activity delivery (weekly and monthly), staff surveys, and tenant surveys (post-group surveys following tenant psychoeducation groups and an all-tenant survey). Qualitative data included focus groups with staff and stakeholders, program documents, and free-text survey responses. RESULTS: All three program activity domains (multidisciplinary supports, tenant engagement, staff capacity-building) were successfully implemented. Main program activities were multidisciplinary case conferences, direct psychiatric consultation, tenant psychoeducation sessions, formal staff training, and informal staff support. Psychoeducation for tenants and informal/formal staff support were particularly valued. Most activities were team-based. Of the shared lenses, trauma-informed care was the most consistently implemented. Facilitators to implementation were shared lenses, psychiatrist characteristics, shared time/space, balance between structure and flexibility, building trust, logistical support, and the embedded evaluation. Barriers were that the initial model was driven by leadership, confusion in initial processes, different workflows across organizations, and staff turnover; where possible, iterative changes were implemented to address barriers. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation highlights the process of successfully implementing a shifted outpatient collaborative mental health care initiative in supportive housing. Further work is warranted to evaluate whether collaborative care adaptations in supportive housing settings lead to improvements in tenant- and program-level outcomes.

One of the most effective steps to protect the environment is to assess farmers behavior in achieving the goals of environmental sustainability. This study aimed to analyze the environmental sustainability behavior of farmers using the norm activation theory (NAT) in a questionnaire-based survey. The statistical population comprised wheat farmers in Kermanshah province, Iran (N = 126,900). The sample size was determined to be 382 farmers by Krejcie and Morgans table. The validity of the questionnaire was verified by experts and its reliability was confirmed by a pilot test and calculating Cronbachs alpha. Five variables of perceived behavior control, perceived self-efficacy, ascription of responsibility, denial of responsibility, and awareness of consequences had significant effects on personal norms. The variable of personal norms had a significant effect on farmers sustainable behavior. By and large, it can be concluded that NAT can adequately account for the environmental sustainability of farmers.","output":"Analysis of farmers environmental sustainability behavior: the use of norm activation theory (a sample from Iran)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study examines recently revised Korean government legislation addressing global infectious disease control for public health emergency situations, with the aim of proposing more rational, effective and realistic interpretations and applications for improvement of law. METHODS: The Korea reported its first laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus on May 20, 2015. Since the first indexed case, Korean public health authorities enforced many public health measures that were not authorized in the law; the scope of the current law was too limited to cover MERS. Korea has three levels of government: the central government, special self-governing provinces, and si/gun/gu. Unfortunately, the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act does not designate the specific roles of each level of government, and does not state how these governmental branches should be vertically integrated in a state of emergency. RESULTS: When thinking about these policy questions, we should be especially concerned about introducing a new act that deals with all matters relevant to emerging infectious diseases. The aim would be to develop a structure that specifies the roles of each level of government, and facilitates the close collaboration among them, then enacting this in law for the prevention and response of infectious disease. CONCLUSIONS: To address this problem, after analyzing the national healthcare infrastructure along with the characteristics of emerging infectious diseases, we propose the revision of the relevant law(s) in terms of governance aspects, emergency medical countermeasure aspects, and the human rights aspect.","output":"Infectious disease-related laws: prevention and control measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although surface engineering has been regarded to be a great approach to modulate the optical and electrical properties of nanomaterials, the spontaneous covalent functionalization on semiconducting 2H-MoS2 is a notoriously difficult process, while several reactions have been performed on metallic 1T-MoS2.

Additionally, correlation analysis was performed between students' self- and examiners' assessment of the treatment results. Methods: Within 4 hours, 22 examinees each had to place a multi-surface adhesive anterior and posterior restoration, performed an endodontic treatment on a maxillary premolar and a periodontal debridement of one quadrant. All treatments were performed on a model fixed in a phantom head. Compliance with the prescribed hygiene and social distancing guidelines and self-assessment of the practical performance was part of the practical examination as well. One examiner per examination part evaluated anonymously the final results. The historical control was based on the exam results of a cohort from 2019. Mean values (standard deviation), non-parametric correlations (Spearman's Rho) and group comparisons (Mann-Whitney) were calculated for statistical analysis. Results: Examination results under simulated treatment conditions were significantly worse (p<0.05) than in the cohort that took their state exam in patients, with exception of the endodontic partial exam. The overall scores in restorative dentistry and periodontology of both groups, which include a structured theoretical examination, did not differ. The majority of the candidates rated their performance worse than the examiners, and there was no correlation between self- and third-party assessment. Conclusion: In the comparison of two years, a simulated practical examination without patients in restorative dentistry, endodontics and periodontology resulted in matchable results compared with an examination on patients. Equal conditions for the candidates resulting in better comparability and avoidance of ethical dilemmas of patient treatment under examination conditions could also be arguments towards a state examination under phantom conditions in the future.","output":"Retrospective investigation of organization and examination results of the state examination in restorative dentistry, endodontology and periodontology under simulated conditions in times of Covid-19 compared to standard conditions when treating patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last three decades, the role of higher education institutions (HEIs) in employability skill development has been emphasised in UK national policy Within the same time frame, internationalisation has emerged as a key strategy in higher education (HE), nationally and globally However, the connection between the internationalisation of higher education and developing graduate employability is an understudied area of research This paper addresses an identified gap in extant literature by examining the intersection of internationalisation, employability and the international student experience The paper focuses on non\\\\EU international students' perspectives which is neglected in dominant discourses on employability Thematic analysis of data collected from 36 semi\\\\structured interviews with students from 11 non\\\\EU countries reveals the importance international students place on employability development opportunities during their study abroad The findings highlight how international student agency is enabled or constrained within the affordances of international HE, and the implications for employability policy development in an increasingly internationalised context of the delivery of higher education In conclusion, the implication of the findings is considered in view of the constraints on mobility brought on by COVID\\\\19 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Higher Education Quarterly is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"International students' perspective on developing employability during study abroad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED (99m)Tc is currently produced by an aging fleet of nuclear reactors, which require enriched uranium and generate nuclear waste. We report the development of a comprehensive solution to produce (99m)Tc in sufficient quantities to supply a large urban area using a single medical cyclotron. METHODS A new target system was designed for (99m)Tc production. Target plates made of tantalum were coated with a layer of (100)Mo by electrophoretic deposition followed by high-temperature sintering. The targets were irradiated with 18-MeV protons for up to 6 h, using a medical cyclotron. The targets were automatically retrieved and dissolved in 30% H2O2. (99m)Tc was purified by solid-phase extraction or biphasic exchange chromatography. RESULTS Between 1.04 and 1.5 g of (100)Mo were deposited on the tantalum plates. After high-temperature sintering, the (100)Mo formed a hard, adherent layer that bonded well with the backing surface. The targets were irradiated for 1-6.9 h at 20-240 A of proton beam current, producing up to 348 GBq (9.4 Ci) of (99m)Tc. The resulting pertechnetate passed all standard quality control procedures and could be used to reconstitute typical anionic, cationic, and neutral technetium radiopharmaceutical kits. CONCLUSION The direct production of (99m)Tc via proton bombardment of (100)Mo can be practically achieved in high yields using conventional medical cyclotrons. With some modifications of existing cyclotron infrastructure, this approach can be used to implement a decentralized medical isotope production model. This method eliminates the need for enriched uranium and the radioactive waste associated with the processing of uranium targets.","output":"Implementation of Multi-Curie Production of (99m)Tc by Conventional Medical Cyclotrons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The facemasks use has been discussed to prevent respiratory disease due airborne contamination.

Thirty six patients were composed of three groups; Group A,4 from Diamond Princess cruise ship, Group B, 2 infected in Africa, and Group C, 30 infected in Japan. PCR assays were conducted at outside laboratories before and repeated in house after hospitalized. Of 36 at admission, positive antibody was seen in 4/4 from the ship, 0/2 from Africa, and 5/30 from Japan. Two from Africa showed the increase of COI and became positive on days 8 and 13.

To increase the number of successfully targeted bacterial strains, phage cocktails, instead of a single phage, are commonly formulated. Nevertheless, there is currently no consensus pipeline for phage cocktail development. Thus, although large cocktails increase the spectrum of activity, they could produce side effects such as the mobilization of virulence or antibiotic resistance genes. On the other hand, coinfection (simultaneous infection of one host cell by several phages) might reduce the potential for bacteria to evolve phage resistance, but some antagonistic interactions amongst phages might be detrimental for the outcome of phage cocktail application. With this in mind, we introduce here a new method, which considers the host range and each individual phage-host interaction, to design the phage mixtures that best suppress the target bacteria while minimizing the number of phages to restrict manufacturing costs. Additionally, putative phage-phage interactions in cocktails and phage-bacteria networks are compared as the understanding of the complex interactions amongst bacteriophages could be critical in the development of realistic phage therapy models in the future.","output":"Systematic analysis of putative phage-phage interactions on minimum-sized phage cocktails"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Health and Disability Code precludes any research involving a competent patient without the informed consent of the participant.

We introduced smartphone data collection to replace paper-based data collection for an influenza sentinel surveillance system in four hospitals in Kenya. We compared the quality, cost and timeliness of data collection between the smartphone data collection system and the paper-based system. METHODS: Since 2006, the Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical support from the Kenya Medical Research Institute/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KEMRI/CDC) conducted hospital-based sentinel surveillance for influenza in Kenya. In May 2011, the MOH replaced paper-based collection with an electronic data collection system using Field Adapted Survey Toolkit (FAST) on HTC Touch Pro2 smartphones at four sentinel sites. We compared 880 paper-based questionnaires dated Jan 2010-Jun 2011 and 880 smartphone questionnaires dated May 2011-Jun 2012 from the four surveillance sites. For each site, we compared the quality, cost and timeliness of each data collection system. RESULTS: Incomplete records were more likely seen in data collected using pen-and-paper compared to data collected using smartphones (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 7, 95% CI: 4.4-10.3). Errors and inconsistent answers were also more likely to be seen in data collected using pen-and-paper compared to data collected using smartphones (aIRR: 25, 95% CI: 12.5-51.8). Smartphone data was uploaded into the database in a median time of 7 days while paper-based data took a median of 21 days to be entered (p < 0.01). It cost USD 1,501 (9.4%) more to establish the smartphone data collection system ($17,500) than the pen-and-paper system (USD $15,999). During two years, however, the smartphone data collection system was $3,801 (7%) less expensive to operate ($50,200) when compared to pen-and-paper system ($54,001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to paper-based data collection, an electronic data collection system produced fewer incomplete data, fewer errors and inconsistent responses and delivered data faster. Although start-up costs were higher, the overall costs of establishing and running the electronic data collection system were lower compared to paper-based data collection system. Electronic data collection using smartphones has potential to improve timeliness, data integrity and reduce costs.","output":"A comparison of smartphones to paper-based questionnaires for routine influenza sentinel surveillance, Kenya, 2011C2012"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection is difficult to distinguish clinically from infection or post-operative inflammation.

DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted from April 2th to April 16(th) 2020. SETTING: The survey was conducted among 15.0000 of 18.000 orthopedic and trauma surgeons in Germany, both in private practices and hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: All members of the German Society of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) and the Professional Association for Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (BVOU). were invited by e-mail to participate in the survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Out of 50 questions 42 were designed to enquire a certain dimension of the pandemic impact and contribute to one of six indices, namely Preparedness, Resources, Reduction, Informedness, Concern, and Depletion. Data was analyzed in multiple stepwise regression, aiming to identify those factors that independently influenced the indices. RESULTS: 858 orthopedic and trauma surgeons participated in the survey throughout Germany. In the multiple regression analysis, being employed at a hospital was identified as an independent positive predictor in the indices for Preparedness, Resources, and Informedness and an independent negative predictor regarding Depletion. Self-employment was found to be an independent positive predictor of the financial index Depletion. Female surgeons were identified as an independent variable for a higher level of Concern. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms a distinct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery in Germany. The containment measures are largely considered appropriate despite severe financial constraints. A substantial lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is reported. The multiple regression analysis shows that self-employed surgeons are more affected by this shortage as well as by the financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals. WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound impact on orthopedic and trauma surgery as an unrelated specialty. Self-employed surgeons are affected especially by a shortage of PPE and financial consequences. HOW MIGHT IT IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE IN THE NEAR FUTURE: Political and financial support can now be applied more focused to subgroups in the field of orthopedics and trauma surgery with an increased demand for support. A special emphasis should be set on the support of self-employed surgeons which are a more affected by the shortage of PPE and financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals.","output":"Collateral effect of COVID-19 on orthopedic and trauma surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide has brought huge challenges to urban governance.

Standard models for production functions are not adequate to model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption. We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects, and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in economic output.

The COVID-19 outbreak occurred suddenly, and many countries were ill prepared to face it. Community behaviour has been altered due to the pandemic. Uncertainty surrounding the disease triggered panic buying; public panic caused additional worry about limited food supplies, and thus demand increased. World economies have also felt the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Owing to the measures put in place to address the spread of COVID-19, many service providers and industries were closed, resulting in financial losses, and the risk of unemployment was elevated, which inevitably increased negative emotions in individuals. A psychosocial consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is worldwide fear. Because psychological defence is a supporting factor for the recovery of COVID-19 patients, it is important to encourage prevention of mental stress. Psychotherapy is able to provide counselling services to the community through teleconsultation.

This piece aims to determine the use of accompaniment in healthcare interactions by persons with sensory impairment. METHODS: These cross-sectional analyses included data from the 2015 Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey and survey weighting provided by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Adjusted odds of reporting accompaniment to healthcare visits and given reasons for accompaniment among United States Medicare beneficiaries with self-reported sensory impairment (hearing, vision, and dual sensory impairment) were examined. RESULTS: After excluding observations with missing data, 10,748 Medicare beneficiaries remained representing a 46 million total weighted nationally representative sample, of which 88.9% reported no sensory impairment, 5.52% reported hearing impairment, 3.56% reported vision impairment, and 0.93% reported dual sensory impairment.

A secondary analysis suggests communication needs as the primary reason for accompaniment among persons with hearing loss, while those with vision impairment were more likely to indicate transportation needs. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare accompaniment is common for persons with sensory loss and healthcare systems should consider accommodations for and leveraging accompaniment to improve healthcare for persons with sensory impairments.

This qualitative study sought to understand how this dramatic change in delivery has affected mental health care, including modes of telemedicine psychiatrists used, barriers encountered, and future plans. The aim was to inform the ongoing COVID-19 response and pass on lessons learned to psychiatrists who are starting to offer telemedicine. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2020, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 outpatient psychiatrists practicing in five U.S. states with significant early COVID-19 activity. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop interview summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: At the time of the interviews, all 20 psychiatrists had been using telemedicine for 2-4 weeks. Telemedicine encompassed video visits, phone visits, or both. Although many continued to prefer in-person care and planned to return to it after the pandemic, psychiatrists largely perceived the transition positively. However, several noted challenges affecting the quality of provider-patient interactions, such as decreased clinical data for assessment, diminished patient privacy, and increased distractions in the patient's home setting. Several psychiatrists noted that their disadvantaged patients lacked reliable access to a smartphone, computer, or the Internet. Participants identified several strategies that helped them improve telemedicine visit quality. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a dramatic shift in how psychiatrists deliver care.

Carbohydrate binding specificity of BCA was examined by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC assay using 42 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides. BCA bound to high mannose-type N-glycans but not to the complex-type, hybrid-type core structure of N-glycans or oligosaccharides from glycolipids. This lectin had exclusive specificity for 1-2-linked mannose at the nonreducing terminus. The binding activity was enhanced as the number of terminal 1-2-linked mannose substitutions increased. Mannobiose, mannotriose, and mannopentaose were incapable of binding to BCA. Thus, BCA preferentially recognized the nonreducing terminal 1-2-mannose cluster as a primary target. As predicted from carbohydrate-binding propensity, this lectin inhibited the HIV-1 entry into the host cells at a half-maximal effective concentration of 8.2 nm. A high association constant (3.71  10(8) M(-1)) of BCA with the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance analysis.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) can be used to monitor pathogens in animal species and identify potential zoonotic threats.

METHODS: We constructed a zoonotic pathogen survey model using a set of mobile laboratories. RESULTS: The monitoring in this study was preplanned to detect Yersinia pestis, but the mNGS unexpectedly identified Bartonella spp. in the rodent samples, thus exposing the threat of bartonellosis to humans in this region. The co-localization of sampling and sequencing (CLOSS) model we tested required no long-distance transferring of samples and expands the regional coverage of zoonotic surveys by using a mobile laboratory. DISCUSSION: Using this mNGS technique will enable detection of more zoonotic pathogens beyond the preplanned monitoring targets. This may increase the surveillance efficiency compared with that of the previous workflow and expand the application of the mobile laboratories for infectious diseases identification and surveillance in the field.","output":"Co-Localization of Sampling and Sequencing for Zoonotic Pathogen Identification in the Field Monitoring Using Mobile Laboratories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study analyses the prevalent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic using machine learning algorithms The data set used is an API data provided by the John Hopkins University resource centre and used the Web crawler to gather all the data features such as confirmed, recovered and death cases Because of the unavailability of any COVID-19 drug at the moment, the unvarnished truth is that this outbreak is not expected to end in the near future, so the number of cases of this study would be very date specific The analysis demonstrated in this paper focuses on the monthly analysis of confirmed, recovered and death cases, which assists to identify the trend and seasonality in the data The purpose of this study is to explore the essential concepts of time series algorithms and use those concepts to perform time series analysis on the infected cases worldwide and forecast the spread of the virus in the next two weeks and thus aid in health-care services Lower obtained mean absolute percentage error results of the forecasting time interval validate the models credibility Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the time series analysis of this outbreak forecast was done using the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and also seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving averages with exogenous regressor (SARIMAX) and optimized to achieve better results Findings: The inferences of time series forecasting models ARIMA and SARIMAX were efficient to produce exact approximate results The forecasting results indicate that an increasing trend is observed and there is a high rise in COVID-19 cases in many regions and countries that might face one of its worst days unless and until measures are taken to curb the spread of this disease quickly The pattern of the rise of the spread of the virus in such countries is exactly mimicking some of the countries of early COVID-19 adoption such as Italy and the USA Further, the obtained numbers of the models are date specific so the most recent execution of the model would return more recent results The future scope of the study involves analysis with other models such as long short-term memory and then comparison with time series models Originality/value: A time series is a time-stamped data set in which each data point corresponds to a set of observations made at a particular time instance This work is novel and addresses the COVID-19 with the help of time series analysis The inferences of time series forecasting models ARIMA and SARIMAX were efficient to produce exact approximate results ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Time series analysis of COVID-19 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Birds play a key role in ecosystem dynamics, including urban and rural areas, bringing environmental quality improvements and ecological stability. Species contribute directly to natural regeneration of vegetation and succession processes, by offering ecosystem services as seed dispersal, an important role in human-modified areas. We studied the assemblages of fruit-eating birds in riparian environments of Monjolinho basin, central S?o Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. Birds were recorded in 41 points distributed in riparian ecosystems alongside waterbodies, in landscapes with five types of surrounding matrices: urban, periurban, farmland, and native vegetation. We described how assemblages are structured aiming to evaluate the possible influence of seasonality and landscape type. We recorded 39 bird species that can play a role as seed-dispersers, 32 in wet season and 32 in dry season. There were no significant differences in the diversity and dominance of species between seasons considering the entire area, indicating stability of basic assemblage structure. However, total number of individuals of all species recorded in different landscapes were influenced by seasonality. Also, the composition and abundance of species significantly changed between seasons, leading to a high dissimilarity with almost 50% of the species contributing with almost 90% of the observed variation. A higher taxonomic diversity and distinctness pointed to a wider array of possible seed dispersal services in natural areas, while the lowest values of indexes were found in human-modified areas. The higher number of non-related bird species during dry season contrasted with the higher number of individuals during wet season, indicating that there is more possible ecosystem services offered by frugivorous birds in driest period of the year, while in the rainy period the carrying capacity of the riparian environments was increased.","output":"Seed-dispersing bird assemblages in riparian environments of a partially urbanized river basin, Southeastern Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 led to a situation of home lockdown.

In vivo experiments revealed that fatty acid (FA) metabolic processes up-regulated following EO. In vitro studies further uncovered that FAs derived from ACs are taken up by macrophages mainly through macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1). Then, our functional experiments confirmed that these exogenous FAs subsequently activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), which further facilitates lipid droplets generation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Mechanistically, elevated FAO is involved in up-regulating the osteoinductive effect by generating BMP7 and NAD+/SIRT1/EZH2 axis epigenetically controls BMP7 expression in macrophages cultured with ACs culture medium.

CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients is significantly associated with prolonged ICU length of stay, higher need of mechanical ventilation, and increased risk of mortality in the critical care setting. Tighter blood glucose control (<140 mg/dL) might improve outcomes in COVID-19 critically-ill patients, evidence from ongoing clinical trials is needed. This article is protected by copyright.

Coronaviruses contain the largest single-stranded positive-polarity RNA genome in nature. The approximately 30-kb genome, coupled with regions of genomic instability, has hindered the development of a full-length infectious cDNA construct. We have assembled a full-length infectious construct of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an important pathogen in swine. Using a novel approach, six adjoining cDNA subclones that span the entire TGEV genome were isolated. Each clone was engineered with unique flanking interconnecting junctions which determine a precise systematic assembly with only the adjacent cDNA subclones, resulting in an intact TGEV cDNA construct of approximately 28.5 kb in length. Transcripts derived from the full-length TGEV construct were infectious, and progeny virions were serially passaged in permissive host cells. Viral antigen production and subgenomic mRNA synthesis were evident during infection and throughout passage. Plaque-purified virus derived from the infectious construct replicated efficiently and displayed similar plaque morphology in permissive host cells. Host range phenotypes of the molecularly cloned and wild-type viruses were similar in cells of swine and feline origin. The recombinant viruses were sequenced across the unique interconnecting junctions, conclusively demonstrating the marker mutations and restriction sites that were engineered into the component clones. Full-length infectious constructs of TGEV will permit the precise genetic modification of the coronavirus genome. The method that we have designed to generate an infectious cDNA construct of TGEV could theoretically be used to precisely reconstruct microbial or eukaryotic genomes approaching several million base pairs in length.","output":"Strategy for systematic assembly of large RNA and DNA genomes: transmissible gastroenteritis virus model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective To compare physiological effects of sufentanil-midazolam with sevoflurane for surgical anaesthesia in medetomidine premedicated rabbits. Study design Prospective, randomized controlled experimental study. Animals Eighteen female Himalayan rabbits, weight 2.1  0.1 kg. Methods Premedication with 0.1 mg kg?1 medetomidine and 5 mg kg?1 carprofen subcutaneously, was followed by intravenous anaesthetic induction with sufentanil (2.3 g mL?1) and midazolam (0.45 mg mL?1). After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with sufentanil-midazolam (n = 9) or sevoflurane (n = 9). Ovariohysterectomy was performed. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was performed as required. Physiological variables were studied perioperatively. Group means of physiologic data were generated for different anaesthetic periods. Data were compared for changes from sedation, and between groups by anova. Post-operatively, 0.05 mg kg?1 buprenorphine was administered once and 5 mg kg?1 carprofen once daily for 2C3 days. Rabbits were examined and weighed daily until one week after surgery. Results Smooth induction of anaesthesia was achieved within 5 minutes. Sufentanil and midazolam doses were 0.5 g kg?1 and 0.1 mg kg?1, during induction and 3.9 g kg?1 hour?1 and 0.8 mg kg?1 hour?1 during surgery, respectively. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 2.1% during surgery. Assisted ventilation was required in nine rabbits receiving sufentanil-midazolam and four receiving sevoflurane. There were no differences between groups in physiologic data other than arterial carbon dioxide. In rabbits receiving sevoflurane, mean arterial pressure decreased pre-surgical intervention, heart rate increased 25% during and after surgery and body weight decreased 4% post-operatively. Post-operative problems sometimes resulted from catheterization of the ear artery. Conclusion Sevoflurane and sufentanil-midazolam provided surgical anaesthesia of similar quality. Arterial blood pressure was sustained during sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia and rabbits receiving sevoflurane lost body weight following ovariohysterectomy. Mechanical ventilation was required with both anaesthetic regimens. Clinical relevance Anaesthesia with sufentanil-midazolam in medetomidine premedicated healthy rabbits is useful in the clinical and the research setting, as an alternative to sevoflurane.","output":"Intravenous sufentanil-midazolam versus sevoflurane anaesthesia in medetomidine pre-medicated Himalayan rabbits undergoing ovariohysterectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps through the world, we must reassess the principles that guide our individual and collective responses and the way we operate in society.

We sought to study the implementation of innovative materials in waste management and the progressive construction of protocols, habits, and levers of adaptation. This research was carried out using a socio-spatial approach and essentially mobilized the tools of qualitative investigation. RESULTS: Our study highlighted that a hospital waste management culture is progressively established, thanks to an effort to plan activities, to promote the sector, the activities and the emergence of a profession organized around waste management. However, the distinct waste management sectors are struggling to stabilize due to the differentiated statuses and perceptions of the agents. Finally, the success of hospital waste management depends on waste collection at the city level.

While intra-arterial therapy has significantly evolved in recent years, anatomic cerebrovascular variants and disease burden can present challenges to timely recanalization. We present the first reported case of anterior-to-posterior mechanical clot retrieval with use of a stent retriever. Case description A 53-year-old man presented with basilar artery thrombosis. Endovascular mechanical clot retrieval was performed. The typical, antegrade, access to the basilar artery thrombus was precluded by the findings of a hypoplastic left vertebral artery and an occluded proximal right vertebral artery. Given a number of factors including the patient's worsening symptoms and the high morbidity and mortality associated with basilar stroke, cross-circulation-anterior-to-posterior-intra-arterial therapy was performed. Thrombectomy of the basilar thrombus was achieved via the right internal carotid artery and right posterior communicating artery. Conclusion To our knowledge, we report the first case of cross-circulation, anterior-to-posterior thrombectomy, with the use of a stent-retriever device.

We find that pandemic fatigue significantly increases with time and the severity of lockdowns but also decreases with COVID-19 deaths. When triggered, fatigue elicits a broad range of discontent, including protest support and conspiratorial thinking. The results demonstrate the importance of distress for the activation of populism and discontent.

Annually it can prevent nearly 2 to 3 million deaths. Understanding the determinants of effective immunization coverage is a critical undertaking. Accordingly, we set out to check the best available evidence of outstanding predictors of immunization coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Ethiopia. METHOD: Electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, HINARI, and SCOPUS, Web of Science, African Journals Online, Ethiopian Medical Journals were searched. The search process, study selection, critical appraisal, and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers using Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-analysis for Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). The difference between reviewers was resolved with a third person. The risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Tool for observational studies. Data were extracted using the Microsoft Excel checklist and exported to STATA 13. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2, Funnel plot and Egger's test was used to check for publication bias. RESULTS: We identified 26 studies with 15,042 children with mothers/caretakers to assess factors associated with immunization coverage and significant factors were: maternal formal education, (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.62-3.72), paternal formal education, (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.27-3.77), residence, (OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.00-4.45), birth at health facility (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 0.99-3.49), family size less than four, (OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.16-2.84), knowledge on age of immunization to be completed (OR = 6.18;95% CI: 3.07-12.43), knowledge on immunization schedule (OR = 2.49; 95% CI: 1.35-4.59), time to travel to health faculties, (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 0.62-4.89), antennal care, (OR = 3.11; 95% CI: 1.64-5.88), and tetanus toxoid vaccination, (OR = 4.82; 95% CI: 2.99-7.75).

RESULTS We followed the offspring recording atopy, wheezing, and other respiratory illnesses through 30 months of age. Cord blood and peripheral blood at 30 months of age were taken to measure cytokines, adipokines, metabolic biomarkers, and specific IgE. Adjusted regression models were used to evaluate the association between maternal obesity and offspring asthma risk, defined by a positive Asthma Predictive Index (API). 339 mothers were recruited; 140 offspring were born from NL, 80 from OW, and 119 from OB mothers. OB women were older, less educated, had higher parity, and higher C-section frequency. Offspring from OB women had higher birthweight, head circumference, and placental weight compared to other groups. The proportion of API+ at 30 months of age was 12.2% in the NL, 14.7% in the OW, and 16.8% in the OB group (p=0.18).

Herein, CCL2 and CCL5 are screened as two major chemokines responsible for attracting TAM infiltration and inducing their polarization toward cancer-promoting M2-phenotype. To reverse this immunosuppressive process, an innovative single-domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) with high potency and specificity is directly evolved. mRNA encoding BisCCL2/5i is encapsulated in a clinically approved lipid nanoparticle platform, resulting in a liver-homing biomaterial that allows transient yet efficient expression of BisCCL2/5i in the diseased organ in a multiple dosage manner. This BisCCL2/5i mRNA nanoplatform significantly induces the polarization of TAMs toward the antitumoral M1 phenotype and reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD-1 ligand inhibitor (PD-Li) achieves long-term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers.

A recently performed meta-analysis and systematic review evaluated suicide mortality in physicians by gender and investigated several related risk factors. It showed a post-1980 suicide mortality ratio 46% higher in female physicians than women in the general population and a 33% lower risk in male physicians than men in general, despite an overall contraction in physicians' mortality rates in both genders. METHODS This narrative review was conducted through a search and analysis of relevant articles/databases to address questions raised by the meta-analysis, and how they may be affected by COVID-19. The process included unstructured searches on physician suicide, burnout, medicine judicialization, healthcare organization and COVID-19 on Pubmed, and Google searches for relevant databases, medical society, expert and media commentaries on these topics. We focus on three factors critical to address physician suicides: epidemiological data limitations, psychiatric comorbidities, and professional overload. RESULTS We found relevant articles on suicide reporting, physician mental health, effects of healthcare judicialization and organization on physician and patient health, and how COVID-19 may impact such factors. This review addresses information sources, underreporting/misreporting of physicians' suicide rates, inadequate diagnosis and management of psychiatric comorbidities and chronic effects on physicians' work capacity, and finally, medicine judicialization and organization failure increasing physician \\"burnout\\".

A multicentre study evaluating vacuum-assisted wound closure (100-150 mmHg) and mesh-mediated fascial traction (VAWCM) was performed. METHODS All patients treated with OA after AA repair (2006-2009) were prospectively registered at four centres; those treated <5 days were excluded. All surviving patients underwent a 1-year follow-up, including computed tomography (CT) examination. RESULTS Among 1041 patients treated with open or endovascular repair of AA, 28 (2.9%) had OA treatment with VAWCM; another two had VAWCM after hybrid operations for thoraco-abdominal AA. Eighteen (60%) were operated on for rupture and 12 (40%) electively. Eight had suprarenal or thoraco-abdominal aneurysms. Eight (27%) died within 30 days, none due to OA-related complications. Four died before abdominal closure; primary delayed fascial closure was achieved in all survivors. One-year mortality was 50%. Ten (33%) had bowel ischaemia requiring bowel resection. Late potential OA-related infectious complications occurred in five (17%), all of whom first developed intestinal ischaemia: entero-atmospheric fistulae (two), graft infections (two), aorto-enteric fistula (one). One year follow-up with clinical evaluation and CT showed no signs of graft infection. Incisional hernias occurred in 9 of 15 patients (60%); only three were symptomatic. CONCLUSION VAWCM provided high fascial closure rate after AA repair and long-term OA treatment. Infectious complications occur after intestinal ischaemia and prolonged OA treatment, and are often fatal. The poor prognosis among patients needing OA after AA surgery may be improved by using VAWCM, permitting earlier closure.","output":"Open abdomen treatment after aortic aneurysm repair with vacuum-assisted wound closure and mesh-mediated fascial traction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diels-Alder (DA) cycloadditions in reversible polymer networks are important for designing sustainable materials with self-healing properties. In this study, the DA kinetics of hydroxyl-substituted bis- and tetrafunctional furans with bis- and tris-functional maleimides, both containing ether-functionalized spacers, is investigated by modelling two equilibria representing the endo and exo cycloadduct formation. Concretely, the potential catalysis of the DA reaction through hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl of the furans and carbonyl of the maleimides or ether of the spacers is experimentally and theoretically scrutinized. Initial reaction rates and forward DA rate constants are determined by microcalorimetry at 20 C for a model series of reversible networks, extended with (i) a hydroxyl-free network and hydroxyl-free linear or branched systems, and (ii) polypropylene glycol additives, increasing the hydroxyl concentration. A computational density-functional theory study is carried out on the endo and exo cycloadditions of furan and maleimide derivatives, representative for the experimental ones, in the absence and presence of ethylene glycol as additive. Additionally, an ester-substituted furan was investigated as a hydroxyl-free system for comparison. Experiment and theory indicate that the catalytic effect of H-bonding is absent or very limited.

Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) for kidney stones in our clinic between March 11, 2020, and September 11, 2020, and those in the same period 1 year ago were included in the study. Demographic information, laboratory data, stone characteristics, treatment choices and results were evaluated comparatively. Results: A total of 39 patients in the COVID-19 period (group 1) and 93 patients in the pre- COVID-19 period (group 2) underwent kidney stone surgery. While RIRS was performed to 32 of the patients in group 1, PNL was applied to seven of the patients in group 2. RIRS was performed to 70 patients in group 2, and PNL was applied to 23 of them. While the RIRS/PNL ratio was 4.5 in group 1, it was 3.04 in group 2. During the COVID-19 period, the number of patients who underwent PNL has decreased significantly. Conclusion: The number of elective surgery cases has significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that utilised validated instruments were included. The main outcome was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640.

Genetic analyses revealed that the disease was caused by the triploid hybrid P. x alni, which originated in Europe from the hybridization of P. uniformis and P. x multiformis. Here, we investigated the population structure of P. x alni (158 isolates) and P. uniformis (85 isolates) in several European countries using microsatellite markers. Our analyses confirmed the genetic structure previously observed in other European populations, with P. uniformis populations consisting of at most two multilocus genotypes (MLGs) and P. x alni populations dominated by MLG Pxa-1. The genetic structure of P. x alni populations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Sweden seemed to reflect the physical isolation of river systems. Most rare P. x alni MLGs showed a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at one or a few microsatellite loci compared with other MLGs. This LOH may allow a stabilization within the P. x alni genome or a rapid adaptation to stress situations. Alternatively, alleles may be lost because of random genetic drift in small, isolated populations, with no effect on fitness of P. x alni.

This study aimed to understand clinicians' perceptions of the positive and negative impacts of COVID-19 on primary care in New England. METHODS: This qualitative interview study was conducted from October through December 2020. Participants included 22 physicians and 2 nurse practitioners practicing primary care in New England. Data were thematically coded and analyzed deductively and inductively using content analysis. RESULTS: Through qualitative content analysis, 4 areas were identified in which clinicians perceived that COVID-19 impacted primary care: 1) bureaucracy, 2) leadership, 3) telemedicine and patient care, and 4) clinician work-life. Our findings suggest that the positive impacts of COVID-19 included changes in primary care delivery, new leadership opportunities for clinicians, flexible access to care for patients via telemedicine, and a better work-life balance for clinicians. Respondents identified negative impacts related to sustaining pandemic-inspired changes, the inability for some populations to access care via telemedicine, and the rapid implementation of telemedicine causing frustration for clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding clinician perspectives on how primary care transformed to respond to COVID-19 helps to identify beneficial pandemic-related changes that should be sustained and ideas for improvement that will support patient care and clinician engagement.","output":"COVID-19's Perceived Impact on Primary Care in New England: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the effects of integrating the CloudClassRoom (CCR) and the DEmo-CO-design/teach-feedback-DEbriefing (DECODE) model to improve pre-service teachers online technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK).

Telehealth interventions have been seen as a useful resource with potential to improve clinical effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation of a spiritual and psychological palliative telehealth system during the pandemic. METHODS: Pilot study based on the implementation of a telehealth system designed to support hospitalized patients referred to a mobile palliative care team, through synchronic videoconferences, and including patients relatives. The implementation included protocol development, physical infrastructure, and training. The intervention consisted of spiritual and psychological telehealth sessions performed remotely by the chaplain and psychologist of a palliative care team. RESULTS: During the study period 59 patients were recruited, median age of 70 years, 57.6% females. The primary diagnosis was severe COVID-19 (50.8%), advanced cancer (32.2%) and advanced chronic illness (16.9%). A total of 211 telehealth sessions were carried out, 82% psychological and 18% spiritual. The main criteria for psychological sessions were being related to seriously ill patients with withdrawal or withholding of life-support treatment (60.1%). The main criteria for spiritual sessions were being a patient with spiritual suffering or requesting spiritual assistance (73.6%). An electronic user satisfaction survey indicated high satisfaction rates.

Classifying MAS using the immunological disease continuum model, with strict boundaries that define the limits of innate and adaptive immunity, at one boundary is MAS with loss of immune function, as occurs in the perforinopathies and some cases of sJIACAOSD. Conversely, at the other boundary, immune hypersensitivity with gain of immune function in MHC class II-associated sJIACAOSD and with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy also triggers MAS. This provides a benchmark for evaluating severe inflammation in some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, which cripples primary type I interferon immunity and usually culminates in a lung-centric second wave cytokine-driven alveolitis with associated immunothrombosis; this phenomenon is generally distinct from MAS but can share features with the proposed loss of immune function MAS variant.

Isoprostanes were quantified in the range of 31.1 to 1270 ng/L in raw wastewater samples in two communities in western Kentucky and Tennessee during the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent detection of PGE2 and 5-iPF2-VI in wastewater suggested that PGE2 and 5-iPF2-VI can be a reliable biomarker of community oxidative anxiety. The higher 4-month average mass load of isoprostanes [(ranged from 22.9 mg/d/1000 people to 807 mg/d/1000 people] may be attributed to the elevated community level oxidative anxiety owing COVID-19 uncertainties.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the social and mental effects of the pandemic. We focused on individuals living in private households aged 40 years and older. Participants were asked about pandemic-related changes in receiving and providing support (e.g. personal care, help with household chores), problems arising in taking care of older persons and changes in well-being. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted descriptive and multivariate analyses to show how support changed, problems with support came up and well-being changed in the light of the pandemic and how all this was related. RESULTS: Due to the pandemic older respondents in particular were no longer able to provide the necessary support for others. Especially women reported problems in taking care of older individuals. We found a decrease in well-being for all respondents but most significantly for women and individuals aged 80 years and older. Moreover, problems in the provision of care due to the pandemic and lower well-being were clearly linked. CONCLUSION: Our study showed significant changes in support patterns and well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A substantial part of the respondents reported more loneliness and lower life satisfaction compared to before the pandemic, especially women supporting others.

Yet the sheer magnitude and uniqueness of this event has also spawned a massive mobilization of effort in the scientific community to investigate the virus, to develop therapeutics and vaccines, and to understand the public health impacts. Structural biology has been at the center of these efforts, and so it is advantageous to take an opportunity to reflect on the status of structural science vis--vis its role in the fight against COVID-19, to register the unprecedented response and to contemplate the role of structural biology in addressing future outbreak threats.

Daily lives of a country's citizens always are affected by an economic downturn in various ways and mental health problems are expected to be worsen. AIM The aim of this systematic review is to identify to what extent the economic crisis of the last decade has influenced mental health issues in daily life, by offering an in-depth analysis of such effect. METHODS PRISMA guidelines were followed and PubMed platform was used for the literature research. There were included articles that were published between 2009 and 2019. The search terms used were economic crisis and mental health. An extraction sheet was created to collect the results. RESULTS Thirty-five studies from several countries were included in this review. The results from this articles point out that specific social groups are more vulnerable during periods of economic crisis in terms of mental health impact. Depression, anxiety and stress are some of the most common outcomes. However, not all the evidence sources agree. CONCLUSIONS Despite the disagreements, the economic downturn and its outcomes can effect negatively the psychological state either of the population as a whole or of specific subgroups. Mental health is largely affected by economy and regulatory adjustments of supportive care services are needed to buffer negative effects. Primary care could be a 'remote access server' of specific interventions designed to target vulnerable population groups.

Due to its high economic toll and its impact on personal freedom, we need to ease social distancing and deploy alternative measures, while preventing further waves of infections. While reliable mass testing (for virus RNA) would require too many resources to be effective, CT, which focuses on isolating symptomatic cases and their contacts, has been implemented in many countries. However, the latter approach has reduced efficiency when high numbers of positive patients are burdening the tracing centers. Moreover, CT misses transmissions by asymptomatic cases. Therefore, its effect in reducing the reproduction number has a theoretical limit. To improve effectiveness of contact tracing, we propose to complement it with a strategy relying on identifying and testing symptom free subgroups with a significantly higher than average virus prevalence. We call this smart testing (ST). By testing everybody in these subgroups, in addition to symptomatic cases, also large fractions of pre- and asymptomatic persons can be identified, which enhances the effectiveness of contact tracing. High prevalence subgroups can be found in different ways, which are discussed in this paper. A particularly efficient way is via preselection using cheap and fast virus antigen tests, as proposed recently. Mathematical modeling quantifies the potential reduction of the reproduction number by such a two-stage ST strategy. In addition to global scenarios, also more realistic local applications of two-stage ST have been investigated, that is, within counties, institutions, schools, companies, etc., where members have internal as well as external contacts. All involved model parameters have been varied within realistic ranges and results are presented with probabilities. Even with the most pessimistic parameter set, these results suggest that the effect of two-stage ST on the reproduction number would clearly outweigh its economic cost. Two-stage ST is technically and logistically feasible. Further, it is locally effective also when only applied within small local subpopulations. Thereby, two-stage ST efficiently complements the portfolio of mitigation strategies, which allow easing social distancing without compromising public health.","output":"Smart Investment of Virus RNA Testing Resources to Enhance Covid-19 Mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pennsylvania responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by closing schools and moving to online instruction in March 2020.

The government initiated national TB-DM co-management activities under the National TB Control Program in 2017. This study investigates the detection and treatment outcomes of TB-DM in Jakarta after implementing these activities, and identifies the main factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using TB registry data in two districts of Jakarta, East Jakarta (low-income) and South Jakarta (high-income). A 5-step cascade analysis was used: diagnosed TB patients; TB patients tested for DM; diagnosed TB-DM patients; and patients received and completed TB treatment/cured. We conducted descriptive analyses to understand the characteristics of TB and TB-DM patients, and used a two-level mixed-effect logistic regression to explore factors associated with having a DM test and completing TB treatment/being cured. RESULTS: Over the study period (2017C2019) 50.8% of the new pulmonary TB patients aged over 15 were tested for DM. The percentage increased from 41.7% in 2017C2018 to 60.1% in 2019. Of the TB patients tested for DM, 20.8% were diagnosed with DM. Over 90% of the detected TB-DM patients received standard TB treatment, 86.3% of whom completed treatment/were cured. Patients in East Jakarta were more likely to be tested for DM and to complete standard TB treatment/be cured than patients in South Jakarta (P < 0.001). Bacteriologically positive TB patients were more likely to be tested for DM (OR = 1.37, 95% CIs 1.17,1.60).

OBJECTIVES: To test if an ECC with a 5 L-bag in low-compliance C-ARDS can lead to a reduction in driving pressure (DP) and improve gas exchange, and to understand the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Eleven patients with low-compliance C-ARDS were enrolled and underwent 4 steps: baseline, ECC for 60 min, ECC discontinuation and PEEP reduction. Respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, hemodynamics and electrical impedance tomography were recorded. Four pigs with acute ARDS were studied with ECC to understand the effect of ECC on pleural pressure gradient using pleural pressure transducers in both non-dependent and dependent lung regions. RESULTS: Five minutes of ECC reduced DP from baseline 14.2  1.3 to 12.3  1.3 cmH(2)O (P < 0.001), explained by an improved lung compliance. Changes in DP by ECC were strongly correlated with changes in DP obtained with PEEP reduction (R(2) = 0.82, P < 0.001).

In four pigs with lung injury, ECC led to a decrease in the pleural pressure gradient at end-inspiration [2.2 (1.1C3) vs. 3.0 (2.2C4.1) cmH(2)O, P = 0.035]. CONCLUSIONS: In C-ARDS patients with C(rs) < 35 mL/cmH(2)O, ECC acutely reduces DP. ECC does not improve oxygenation but it can be used as a simple tool to detect hyperinflation as it improves C(rs) and reduces P(pl) gradient. ECC benefits seem to partially fade over time. ECC produces similar changes compared to PEEP reduction.

The control group was recruited prior to the intervention group to avoid contamination. Of the 117 mothers enrolled, 29 intervention and 29 control mothers completed the study. Five questionnaires were administered at baseline and six-months to measure maternal depression, empathy, beliefs about children's emotions, intelligence mindsets, and app use. At 6 months, questionnaires assessing parenting stress, reflective functioning, and perceived value of app were also administered. RESULTS: Mothers in the final sample were similar to those who did not complete the study, except more mothers who dropped out were recruited during COVID-19 and had a lower empathetic subscale score. No differences were found between groups at pre- or post-test. However, because of skewed outcome variables which violated normality principles and the small sample size, quantile regression analyses were performed comparing the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for each outcome. Controlling for pre-test and potential confounders, subsets of SMBI mothers reported lower parental stress, more growth mindset and increased effort to understand their child's feelings. 90% of mothers reported using SMBI at least once per week. 82% of mothers would recommend the SMBI app to new mothers.

Multiple scholars have identified employees' readiness for change as an important factor of successful organisational change, but research focussed on psychological factors that facilitate change readiness is scarce. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether employee dispositional mindfulness contributes to readiness for change. Design/methodology/approach Employees (n = 301) from various industries in New Zealand participated in an online survey shortly after the local COVID-19 lockdown ended. The employees' levels of mindfulness, readiness for change, well-being and distress were assessed using well-validated psychometric scales. Multiple regression analyses tested the effect of mindfulness on readiness for change, with well-being and distress as moderating variables. Findings The results show that the effect of mindfulness on readiness for change is moderated by both well-being and distress. Mindfulness has a positive, significant effect on readiness for change when levels of well-being are high and levels of distress are low. Practical implications These findings have important implications for organisations who aim to promote readiness for change in their employees. Even though mindfulness has been shown to be beneficial, organisations also have to consider the mental states of their employees when managing change. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence that dispositional mindfulness may facilitate the employees' readiness for change, but only when levels of well-being are high and distress are low.","output":"The role of dispositional mindfulness in employee readiness for change during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, WHO currently recommends routine vaccination of adolescent girls with two doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine before sexual debut. However, many countries have yet to implement this because of financial or logistical barriers to delivering two doses outside the infant immunisation programme. Methods: Using three independent HPV transmission models, we estimated the long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness of one-dose versus two-dose HPV vaccination, in 192 countries, assuming that one dose of the vaccine gives either a shorter duration of full protection (20 or 30 years) or lifelong protection but lower vaccine efficacy (e.g., 80%) compared to two doses. We simulated routine vaccination with the 9-valent HPV vaccine in 10-year-old girls at 80% coverage for the years 2021-2120, with a one-year catch-up of 80% 11-14-year-old girls on the first year of the programme. Findings: Over the next century, one-dose vaccination at 80% coverage could avert 64 million (80%UI 62.2-64.8) and 66.6 million (80%UI 63.4-69.1) cervical cancer cases should one dose of the vaccine confer 20 and 30 years of protection, respectively. Should one dose of the vaccine provide lifelong protection at 80% vaccine efficacy, 68.4 million (80%UI 63.8-69.4) cervical cancer cases could be prevented. Across all country income groups, two-dose schedules conferring lifelong protection would avert only slightly more cases (2.1-8.7 million) than the one-dose scenarios explored. Around 330 to 5230 additional girls need to be vaccinated with the second dose to prevent one cervical cancer case, depending on the epidemiological profiles of the country. Interpretation: Results were consistent across the three independent models and suggest that one-dose vaccination has similar health benefits to a two-dose programme while simplifying vaccine delivery, reducing costs and alleviating vaccine supply constraints.

Multiple large reports of CCP treatment in adults exist. Pediatric data on CCP safety and efficacy are limited. METHODS: Single-center prospective, open-label trial looking at safety, antibody kinetics and outcomes of CCP (10 mL/kg, max 1 unit) treatment for COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients with moderate to severe disease or at high risk for serious illness. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled. No infusion-related adverse events occurred. No hematological or metabolic adverse events were noted during hospitalization or at 3-weeks. Ten patients had clinical improvement by day 7 (WHO eight-category ordinal severity scale for COVID-19). Following CCP, anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG increased significantly at 24 hours and high levels were sustained at 7- and 21-days. Transient IgM response was noted. Twelve patients (92.3%) were discharged home, 9 (75%) by day 7 post-CCP. One remained on invasive ventilatory support 42 days after CCP and was eventually discharged to an intermediate care facility. The single patient death was retrospectively confirmed to have had brain death before CCP. CONCLUSION: CCP was well tolerated in pediatric patients, resulted in rapid antibody increase, and did not appear to interfere with immune responses measured at 21 days. More pediatric data are necessary to establish the efficacy of CCP, but our data suggest benefit in moderate to severe COVID-19 when used early. Other immunological or antiviral interventions may be added as supported by emerging data.","output":"Safety and Antibody Kinetics of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The SARS CoV-2 pandemic remains a worldwide challenge. The CRIT Cov U pilot study generated a urinary proteomic biomarker consisting of 50 peptides (COV50), which predicted death and disease progression. Following the interim analysis demanded by the German government, the full dataset was analysed to consolidate findings and propose clinical applications. Methods In eight European countries, 1012 adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were followed up for death and progression along the 8 point WHO scale. Capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was used for urinary proteomic profiling. Statistical methods included logistic regression, receiver operating curve analysis with comparison of the area under curve (AUC) between nested models. Hospitalisation costs were derived from the care facility corresponding with the Markov chain probability of reaching WHO scores ranging from 3 to 8 and flat-rate hospitalistion costs standardised across countries. Findings The entry WHO scores were 1-3, 4-5 and 6 in 445 (44,0%), 529 (52,3%), and 38 (3,8%) patients, of whom 119 died and 271 progressed. The standardised odds ratios associated with COV50 for death were 2,44 (95% CI, 2,05-2,92) unadjusted and 1,67 (1,34-2,07) if adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, comorbidities and baseline WHO score, and 1,79 (1,60-2,01) and 1,63 (1,40-1,90), respectively, for disease progression (p<0,0001 for all). The predictive accuracy of optimised COV50 thresholds were 74,4% (95% CI, 71,6-77,1) for mortality (threshold 0,47) and 67,4% (64,1-70,3) for disease progression (threshold 0,04). On top of covariables and the baseline WHO score, these thresholds improved AUCs from 0,835 to 0,853 (p=0,0331) and from 0,697 to 0,730 (p=0,0008) for death and progression, respectively. Of 196 ambulatory patients, 194 (99,0%) did not reach the 0,04 threshold. Earlier intervention guided by high-risk COV50 levels should reduce hospital days with cost reductions expressed per 1000 patient-days ranging from MEuro 1,208 (95% percentile interval, 1,035-1,406) at low risk (COV50 <0,04) to MEuro 4,503 (4,107-4,864) at high risk (COV50 above 0,04 and age above 65 years). Interpretation The urinary proteomic COV50 marker is accurate in predicting adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Even in mild-to-moderate PCR-confirmed infections (WHO scores 1-5), the 0,04 threshold justifies earlier drug treatment, thereby reducing hospitalisation days and costs.","output":"Predictive performance and clinical application of COV50, a urinary proteomic biomarker in early COVID-19 infection: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: Nations around the world have been significantly impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aims of the study were to explore how parents supported their child/rens home learning;to ascertain the communication, guidance and resources between home and school;and to learn from the experiences of parents to enable more effective practices to be established should similar circumstances arise in the future. The survey yielded 2,509 responses and highlighted the divergence of practices in relation to home-school communications across schools as well as the challenges experienced by parents, particularly those who had one or more children with special educational needs and/or those who had Free School Meal Entitlement. The study was guided by Epsteins Framework of the Six Types of Involvement, most specifically the spheres of parenting, learning from home, communication, collaborating with the community and decision-making. Within Epsteins framework, the challenges and tensions between family, school and work are explored. Recommendations are made that will be helpful to parents, schools, teacher-educators, policy-makers and researchers in informing the shape and delivery of education in Northern Ireland and internationally both during and following the challenge of the current COVID-19 pandemic and for similar situations that may arise in the future.

Analysis of the evidence indicates that while all of these theories are correct, exceptions to each can also be found. The biological roles of oligosaccharides appear to span the spectrum from those that are trivial, to those that are crucial for the development, growth, function or survival of an organism. Some general principles emerge. First, it is difficult to predict a priori the functions a given oligosaccharide on a given glycoconjugate might be mediating, or their relative importance to the organism. Second, the same oligosaccharide sequence may mediate different functions at different locations within the same organism, or at different times in its ontogeny or life cycle. Third, the more specific and crucial biological roles of oligosaccharides are often mediated by unusual oligosaccharide sequences, unusual presentations of common terminal sequences, or by further modifications of the sugars themselves. However, such oligosaccharide sequences are also more likely to be targets for recognition by pathogenic toxins and microorganisms. As such, they are subject to more intra- and inter-species variation because of ongoing hostpathogen interactions during evolution. In the final analysis, the only common features of the varied functions of oligosaccharides are that they either mediate specific recognition events or that they provide modulation of biological processes. In so doing, they generate much of the functional diversity required for the development and differentiation of complex organisms, and for their interactions with other organisms in the environment.","output":"Biological roles of oligosaccharides: all of the theories are correct"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of the disease COVID-19, in Pozestina in relation to China, where it originated in other parts of Croatia, appeared somewhat later, while Pozega-Slavonia County in terms of total share in relation to other counties in Croatia remained relatively well, 16th place, out of a total of 20 counties, ie a smaller number of patients was recorded.

Previous studies in intensive care units (ICUs) have found differences in HH compliance between those moments that protect the patient, and those that protect the healthcare provider. However, such studies did not control for other variables known to impact HH compliance. Aim To examine HH among healthcare workers (HCWs) in ICU settings, and identify whether there is a statistical difference in HH compliance between patient-protective and self-protective moments, while controlling for other variables known to influence HH compliance (i.e. professional role, unit and shift time). Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in four ICUs across three Irish hospitals. Compliance was assessed according to the WHO's 'five moments for hand hygiene'. HCW professional role, total number of 'opportunities' for HH and whether compliance was achieved were recorded. Results A total of 712 HH opportunities were recorded, with an overall compliance rate of 56.9%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that physicians, allied healthcare professionals and auxiliary staff were less likely than nurses to engage in HH. HCWs were more likely to comply during night shifts compared to morning shifts, and with self-protective as compared to patient-protective HH moments.

However, some eukaryotic protists such as slime molds generate diverse and complex structures while remaining in a multinucleated syncytial state. It is unknown if different regions of these giant syncytial cells have distinct transcriptional responses to environmental encounters, and if nuclei within the cell diversify into heterogeneous states. Here we performed spatial transcriptome analysis of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum in the plasmodium state under different environmental conditions, and used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to dissect gene expression heterogeneity among nuclei. Our data identifies transcriptome regionality in the organism that associates with proliferation, syncytial substructures, and localized environmental conditions. Further, we find that nuclei are heterogenous in their transcriptional profile, and may process local signals within the plasmodium to coordinate cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. To understand how nuclei variation within the syncytium compares to heterogeneity in single-nucleated cells, we analyzed states in single Physarum amoebal cells. We observed amoebal cell states at different stages of mitosis and meiosis, and identified cytokinetic features that are specific to nuclei divisions within the syncytium. Notably, we do not find evidence for predefined transcriptomic states in the amoebae that are observed in the syncytium. Our data shows that a single-celled slime mold can control its gene expression in a region-specific manner while lacking cellular compartmentalization, and suggests that nuclei are mobile processors facilitating local specialized functions.

METHODS A survey was administered in a Singapore ED (June 2016-June 2017). A convenience sample of parents/carers accompanying pediatric patients completed a self-administered questionnaire. The primary outcome measures were prevalence of CAM use and perceptions of CAM. RESULTS Parents/carers of 610 patients participated. Four hundred seventy-five (78.0%, 95% confidence interval, 74.5-81.0) had taken a CAM within the previous 12 months and 110 (18.1%; 95% confidence interval, 14.8-21.0) had taken a CAM on the day of presentation. There were no sex differences between CAM users and nonusers (P = 0.691). The use of CAM was more common among preschool children and younger (62.9%). There was no difference in CAM use among those with and without chronic disease (P = 0.878). Vitamins/supplements, cod liver oil, and probiotics were the most commonly used CAM. A total of 0.7% of CAM use was reported to the ED doctor. There were no adverse effects reported. The perception that CAMs are safe was more common among parents or caregivers who had administered CAM (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Complementary and alternative medicine use is very common among pediatric ED patients in Singapore and is more prevalent than in Australia and the United Kingdom. However, it is not always reported to the doctor. Parents or caregivers who administer CAM are more likely to perceive CAMs to be safe.","output":"Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Pediatric Emergency Department Patients in Singapore."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: Supplementary material is available for this article at 10.1007/s12250-015-3703-3 and is accessible for authorized users.","output":"Longitudinal surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats by quantitative real-time PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The severity of wheezing episodes is related with the need for health services, but the factors associated with health care utilization in preschool recurrent wheezers in underdeveloped regions are unclear. Objective: To evaluate the factors associated with health care utilization in preschool recurrent wheezers in Cartagena, Colombia. Methods: One hundred twenty-seven recurrent wheezers (age 2-6 years old) who were admitted to the emergency room (ER) due to wheezing in a Pediatric reference hospital in Cartagena were included. Children were evaluated by means of questionnaires and classified according to the number of ER visits, need for hospitalization and history of intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to wheezing within the last year. Total serum IgE and specific IgE to house dust mite allergens (HDM) were measured by ImmunoCAP? and allergen sensitization was evaluated by skin prick tests (SPT). Results: The maternal report of nocturnal cough without fever in their children increased the risk to have 5 ER visits in the last year due to wheezing. The use of montelukast was negatively associated with hospitalization, while a history of pneumonia and lack of tap water, increased the risk of hospitalization due to wheezing. A history of bronchiolitis, family history of asthma, cohabiting with two or more siblings, passive exposure to smoke and lack of sewage facilities increased the risk of ICU admission due to wheezing. The presence of atopy evaluated by SPT reactivity, total IgE levels or specific IgE to HDM were not associated with health care utilization. We also found that seroprevalence of positive IgE (0.35 kU/L) was 27% to B. tropicalis and 20.3% to D. pteronyssinus but the prevalence of positive IgE sensitization to these allergens was below 2% and 8% when evaluated by SPT, respectively. Conclusions: Poverty indicators are associated with ICU admission in a group of preschool recurrent wheezers and should be considered as aggravating factors for wheezing. These factors must be systematically assessed in the medical approach in underdeveloped regions in the tropics. Nocturnal cough without fever is a symptom associated with frequent ER visits while atopy was not associated with health care utilization in preschool recurrent wheezers.","output":"Risk Factors Associated With Health Care Utilization in Preschool Recurrent Wheezers in a Tropical Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The state guarantees all residents in Indonesia health.

The mental health of home-HCWs and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been clarified; therefore, we aimed to investigate the status and associated factors of fear of COVID-19 infection, anxiety, and depression among home-HCWs in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional web-based anonymous survey of home-HCWs in August 2021, during the fifth wave of the pandemic in Japan. We surveyed members of facilities that provided home visit services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S-J) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) as objective variables, and the Japanese version of the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale-II (J-AITCS-II) as an explanatory variable. RESULTS: A total of 328 members of 37 facilities responded to the survey, and we ultimately analyzed 311 participants. The most frequent occupation was nurse (32.8%), followed by doctor (24.8%) and medical office staff (18.0%). The mean score of the FCV-19S-J was 16.5  5.0 (7.0 C 31.0), and the prevalences of definitive anxiety and depression were 7.4% and 15.7%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the J-AITCS-II teamwork subscale was significantly negatively associated with FCV-19S-J, HADS-anxiety, and HADS-depression ( = -0.171, p = 0.004;  = -0.151, p = 0.012;  = -0.225, p < 0.001, respectively). Medical office staff showed significant positive associations with FCV-19S-J and HADS-depression ( = 0.219, p = 0.005;  = 0.201, p = 0.009, respectively), and medical social workers with HADS-anxiety and HADS-depression ( = -0.166, p = 0.011;  = -0.214, p < 0.001, respectively) compared with doctors. The unmet support need for expert lectures on COVID-19 was significantly positively associated with FCV-19S-J ( = 0.131, p = 0.048), and the unmet support need for support systems for psychological stress and emotional exhaustion was significantly positively associated with HADS-anxiety ( = 0.141, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Fear of COVID-19 infection and depression of nurses, medical office staff, and other occupations was significantly higher than those of doctors. These findings suggest that non-physicians were more likely to be fearful and depressed during the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, it is necessary to tailor mental health support based on occupation in the home care setting.","output":"Exploration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of home health care workers in Japan: a multicenter cross-sectional web-based survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by infection with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undoubtedly resulted in significant morbidities, mortalities, and economic disruptions across the globe. Affordable and scalable tools to monitor the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the longevity of induced antibodies will be paramount to monitor and control the pandemic as multiple waves continue to rage in many countries. Serological assays detect humoral responses to the virus, to determine seroprevalence in target populations, or induction of antibodies at the individual level following either natural infection or vaccination. With multiple vaccines rolling out globally, serological assays to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be important tools to monitor the development of herd immunity. To address this need, serological lateral flow assays (LFAs), which can be easily implemented for both population surveillance and home use, will be vital to monitor the evolution of the pandemic and inform containment measures. Such assays are particularly important for monitoring transmission dynamics and durability of immunity generated by natural infections and vaccination, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Based on productive assays, we propose an optimal transfected plasmid ratio mimicking the virus RNA ratio allowing SARS-CoV-2 Virus-Like Particle (VLPs) formation composed of the viral structural proteins M, N, E and S. Furthermore, monochrome, dual-color fluorescent or photoconvertible VLPs were produced. Thanks to live fluorescence and super-resolution microscopy, we quantified VLPs size and concentration. It shows a diameter of 110 and 140 nm respectively for MNE-VLPs and MNES-VLPs with a minimum concentration of 10e12 VLP/ml. SARS-CoV-2 VLPs could tolerate the integration of fluorescent N and M tagged proteins without impairing particle assembly. In this condition, we were able to establish incorporation of the mature Spike in fluorescent VLPs. The Spike functionality was then shown by monitoring fluorescent MNES-VLPs docking and endocytosis in human pulmonary cells expressing the receptor hACE2.

To date, no specific drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19. The inhibition of proteases essential for the proteolytic treatment of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy for conquering viral infections. In the study, molecular docking approach was used to screen potential drug compounds among the phytochemicals of Vitex negundo L. against COVID-19 infection. Molecular docking analysis showed that oleanolic acid forms a stable complex and other phyto-compounds ursolic acid, 3-acetoxyolean-12-en-27-oic acid and isovitexin of V. negundo natural compounds form a less-stable complex. When compared with the control the synergistic interaction of these compounds shows inhibitory activity against papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19).

As the world's main grain-producing country, China has abundant crop residues, &gt;85% of which were utilized as fertilizer, fodder, industrial material, biofuel, and base material in 2019. However, the potential contribution of crop residues to energy and reduced GHG emissions following anaerobic digestion have been scarcely evaluated. Based on crop yield and the field residue index, the annual quantity of crop residues in China from 2000 to 2019 was estimated. The annual crop residue yield increased between 2003 and 2014, and then remained constant at ~970  106 t/a, with an estimated 495  106 t/a being available for biomethane production. This corresponded to a potential biomethane yield of 82.25  109 m3/a, which could have met 29.2% of the annual natural gas consumption and 2.25% of the annual energy consumption in China in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated potential GHG emission reduction was 197  106 t/a (CO 2 equivalent), representing ~2% of China's GHG emissions in 2019. Nevertheless, to reach the expected goal, some crucial technical and equipment-oriented research and development should be promoted to adapt to the characteristics of China's crop residues and regional environment. Moreover, governmental support policies on subsidies would be required for the development of the biomethane industry, which should prioritize northern regions with relatively high quantities of crop residues. ? Energy and GHG emission reduction potential of straw biogas in China was assessed. ? Biomethane yield of 82.25  109 m3/a could be produced from available residues. ?

Infection rates are rapidly rising almost everywhere, and new approaches are required to both prevent transmission, but to also monitor and rescue infected and at-risk patients from severe complications. Point-of-care lung ultrasound has received intense attention as a cost-effective technology that can aid early diagnosis, triage, and longitudinal follow-up of lung health. Detecting pleural abnormalities in previously healthy lungs reveal the beginning of lung inflammation eventually requiring mechanical ventilation with sensitivities superior to chest radiographs or oxygen saturation monitoring. Using a paradigm first developed for space-medicine known as Remotely Telementored Self-Performed Ultrasound (RTSPUS), motivated patients with portable smartphone support ultrasound probes can be guided completely remotely by a remote lung imaging expert to longitudinally follow the health of their own lungs. Ultrasound probes can be couriered or even delivered by drone and can be easily sterilized or dedicated to one or a commonly exposed cohort of individuals. Using medical outreach supported by remote vital signs monitoring and lung ultrasound health surveillance would allow clinicians to follow and virtually lay hands upon many at-risk paucisymptomatic patients. Our initial experiences with such patients are presented, and we believe present a paradigm for an evolution in rich home-monitoring of the many patients expected to become infected and who threaten to overwhelm resources if they must all be assessed in person by at-risk care providers.","output":"Longitudinal remotely mentored self-performed lung ultrasound surveillance of paucisymptomatic Covid-19 patients at risk of disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are preventable in up to 30% of patients with evidence-based infection prevention and control (IPC) activities.

We tested whether this observation translates into renal dysfunction in humans by studying renal functional reserve in adult offspring exposed in utero to maternal type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We compared 19 nondiabetic offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers with 18 offspring of type 1 diabetic fathers (control subjects). Glomerular filtration rate ((51)Cr-EDTA clearance), effective renal plasma flow ((123)I-hippurate clearance), mean arterial pressure, and renal vascular resistances were measured at baseline and during amino acid infusion, which mobilizes renal functional reserve. RESULTS Offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers were similar to control subjects for age (median 27, range 18-41, years), sex, BMI (23.1  3.7 kg/m(2)), and birth weight (3,288  550 vs. 3,440  489 g). During amino acid infusion, glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow increased less in offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers than in control subjects: from 103  14 to 111  17 ml/min (8  13%) vs. from 108  17 to 128  23 ml/min (19  7%, P = 0.009) and from 509  58 to 536  80 ml/min (5  9%) vs. from 536  114 to 620  140 ml/min (16  11%, P = 0.0035).

Nowadays, speckle tracking allows an objective quantification of regional wall function. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of global (GLS) and regional longitudinal strain (RLS) during DSE to detect significant coronary stenosis (SCS). We conducted a prospective observational multicenter study including patients undergoing DSE for suspected SCS. 50 patients with positive DSE underwent coronary angiography. Besides visual regional wall motion score index (WMSI), GLS and RLS were determined at rest and at peak stress by Automated Function Imaging. DSE GLS feasibility was 96%. Among 35 patients with SCS, 12 patients were affected by multivessel disease, 18 had stenosis of left anterior descending artery (LAD), 18 of left circumflex (LCX) and 15 of right coronary artery (RCA). At peak stress, both GLS reduction (p = 0.037) and WMSI worsening (p = 0.04) showed significant agreement with coronary angiography for detecting SCS. When single lesion was considered, peak stress GLS and LAD RLS were lower in the obstructed LAD regions than in normo-perfused territories (17.4  5.5 vs. 20.5  4.4%, p = 0.03; 17.1  7.6 vs. 21.6  5.5%, p < 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, the addition of RLS to regional WMSI was able to improve accuracy in LAD SCS prediction (AUC 0.68, p = 0.037). Conversely, in presence of LCX or RCA SCS, LS was less accurate than WMSI at peak stress. In conclusion, DSE strain analysis is feasible and may improve prediction of LAD SCS, whereas regional WMSI assessment performs better in presence of SCS of LCX and RCA.","output":"Accuracy of global and regional longitudinal strain at peak of dobutamine stress echocardiography to detect significant coronary artery disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of SARS-CoV for cell entry We aimed to check the association between ACE2 and COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in a systematic review Two databases (PubMed/Medline and Scopus) and bioRxiv were checked for retrieving all types of studies in relation to ACE2 and COVID-19 until March 18, 2020 Forty-one studies were entered to the systematic review These studies included nineteen original, eight reviews, four letters to the editor, three research papers, one correspondence, one commentary, one mini review, two reports, one opinion, and one perspective In summary, the results showed that the ACE2 receptor for COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV However, its expression was different in various populations as well as in the two genders ACE2 may be used as a therapeutic target Patients who take ACE inhibitors may have benefit in severe disease outcomes Finally, pangolins and snakes and turtles may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting disease to humans ? 2020 Houshang Nemati, Mazaher Ramezani, Farid Najafi, Babak Sayad, Mehri Nazeri, Masoud Sadeghi","output":"Evaluation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) in covid-19: A systematic review on all types of studies for epidemiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe at a rapid rate, affecting large numbers of individuals in different countries with varying health care systems and infrastructure.

This concept can pose a degree of anxiety for patients as well as neurologists. We aimed to evaluate patient perspectives regarding the use of Natalizumab and anti-CD20 therapies (Rituximab and Ocrelizumab) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: cross-sectional study conducted via voluntary survey filled in by patients with MS and related disorders receiving their infusional treatment in one MS centre in Australia, exploring their concerns regarding their therapy, their therapy and COVID-19, precautions undertaken in response to the pandemic, and factors impacting their decision-making. RESULTS: 170 patients completed the survey. Of patients on Natalizumab, the majority had either no or mild concern regarding their DMT and COVID-19, and of patients on B-cell depleting therapies, again, the majority had no or mild concern, though a slightly higher proportion had a moderate level of concern. Asked to delineate their concerns, an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 was more commonly conveyed than MS-specific factors or poor outcomes pertaining to COVID-19 if contracted, by patients in both groups. Conversely, being invited to specifically consider the possibility of contracting COVID-19 or experience a relapse of MS, almost half of the cohort rated both of equal of concern. More than half of the cohort were self-isolating more stringently than general government advice and government-related resources followed by information provided by patient's neurologist where the commonest means of information to guide decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst a large proportion of patients had some concern regarding the impact of their DMT on COVID-19, whether on their risk of contracting COVID-19 or a theoretical risk for more severe disease, the overall level of concern in most cases was at most mild. Patients on B-cell depleting therapies were more inclined to express a higher level of concern. A similar concern was ascribed to a risk of a relapse or worsening MS symptoms compared to the risk of contracting COVID-19. Such attitudes may underscore a willingness of patients to continue their DMT where benefits outweigh risks during future phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Evaluating the perspective of patients with MS and related conditions on their DMT in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in one MS centre in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the 22nd Presidents column I am writing since I penned my first column in October 2016 Over the past four years I have proudly seen EUPHA grow from strength to strength This is definitely in part due to the fact that EUPHA gives space to individuals of all ages, nationalities and disciplines to participate The only requisite is to be passionate about improving health and well-being for allbe it through research, policy, practice or education and training This openness has allowed us to draw the best talent and most highly motivated individuals in European Public Health to contribute on a voluntary basis to take forward analysis, advocacy and action for the future of health and humanity EUPHA is now in a strong position and well recognized as a credible partner by key supranational organizations including the World Health Organization and the European Commission Having established a Brussels-based office, developed new sections, grown the conference into the largest and most important public health event in Europe and leaving a vibrant office and community of engaged young persons, augurs well for the sustainability of the organization This could not have happened at a more significant moment in the history of public health As the world follows with interest and intensity the international public health emergency posed by the novel corona virus #COVID19, we are starkly reminded of the importance and role of public health and health systems This outbreak is a convergence of an infectious disease epidemic triggered through zoonotic transmission, abetted by an epidemic of misinformation having a marked social, economic and political impact It is a watershed in the history of global health and after this nothing will ever else be the same in European and global public health Whilst lessons are still being learned and much will eventually be written, this outbreak has underlined the interdependence of nations through economic global interconnectedness, the value of science and the importance of democracy, transparency and respect for human rights as issues that merit a new approach and a new order For months now, I have written about the dangers of complacency when it comes to health policy in Europe and about the risks of considering health as having been well achieved in the developed world due to the spectacular increases in life expectancy achieved over the past decades This outbreak has confirmed without any doubt the need to continue to invest in science and research, but also in strong health systems and in new areas of scholarly endeavour based on anthropological and social science No doubt the World Congress of Public Health being organized in Rome in October 2020 comes at a most timely manner and is well placed to discuss what needs to be done no holds barred to prevent and manage public health emergencies not only linked to infectious disease but also other health emergencies including climate change, air pollution, mental health, obesity, diabetes and cancer On a personal note, this column is the last one I shall be writing as EUPHA President The Executive Council has accepted my proposal to move slightly earlier than originally planned into the role of past President since I have assumed a temporary position in the Transition Team of Dr Hans Kluge, the incoming WHO Regional Director for the European Region This is the moment for me to thank all those who have supported EUPHA and myself personally over the past 4 years To my colleagues in the Executive Council, Conference Foundation and Section Councilthank you for walking with me in this journey to continue to build EUPHA into a strong, visible and credible actor for public health in the European region To the wonderful EUPHA office staff working with the incredible Director Dineke Zeegers Pagetthank you for working tirelessly to make our thoughts, dreams and projects come true To our partner organizations on the European Public Health scene and to colleagues working in supranational organizationsthank you for working with us particularly on the European Public Health conferences and the European Public Health Weekthese would not happen without your joint participation!

The utility of these clinical subtypes is unclear. However, the broader distinction between airway-predominant and emphysema-predominant COPD may be clinically relevant. The objective was to define clinical features of emphysema-predominant and non-emphysematous COPD patients. METHODS Current and former smokers from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) had chest computed tomography (CT) scans with quantitative image analysis. Emphysema-predominant COPD was defined by low attenuation area at -950 Hounsfield Units (LAA-950) 10%. Non-emphysematous COPD was defined by airflow obstruction with minimal to no emphysema (LAA-950 < 5%). RESULTS Out of 4197 COPD subjects, 1687 were classified as emphysema-predominant and 1817 as non-emphysematous; 693 had LAA-950 between 5-10% and were not categorized. Subjects with emphysema-predominant COPD were older (65.6 vs 60.6 years, p < 0.0001) with more severe COPD based on airflow obstruction (FEV1 44.5 vs 68.4%, p < 0.0001), greater exercise limitation (6-minute walk distance 1138 vs 1331 ft, p < 0.0001) and reduced quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score 43 vs 31, p < 0.0001). Self-reported diabetes was more frequent in non-emphysematous COPD (OR 2.13, p < 0.001), which was also confirmed using a strict definition of diabetes based on medication use. The association between diabetes and non-emphysematous COPD was replicated in the ECLIPSE study. CONCLUSIONS Non-emphysematous COPD, defined by airflow obstruction with a paucity of emphysema on chest CT scan, is associated with an increased risk of diabetes.

We conducted a survey of 2506 NYC parents of children aged 5 to 11 years. We used survey weights to generate prevalence estimates of vaccine uptake and intentions. Multivariable Poisson regression models generated adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) of vaccine hesitancy, defined as parents who reported being not very likely or not at all likely to vaccinate their children, or unsure about whether to do so. Results. Overall, 11.9% of NYC parents reported that their child was vaccinated; 51.0% were very or somewhat likely to vaccinate; 8.0% were not sure; 29.1% were not very likely or not at all likely to vaccinate their child. Among vaccine-hesitant parents, 89.9% reported safety concerns and 77.8% had concerns about effectiveness. In multivariable models, more vaccine hesitancy was expressed by non-Hispanic Black parents than by non-Hispanic White parents (APR = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17, 1.72) and by parents who were not themselves vaccinated than by parents who were vaccinated (APR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.32, 1.77).

METHOD: The study applied the taxonomic triangulation technique on a clinical management guide to coronavirus disease, COVID-19, from the World Health Organization. The technique is divided into the phases: extraction of knowledge in natural language about assessment, planning and intervention, translation into standard language NOC and NIC, linking to NANDA-I diagnoses, triangulation looking for diagnostic matches in the three sets, and, finally, validation by a panel of experts from a hospital and a university. FINDINGS: The extraction identified 159 terms in natural language that were translated into 173 variables: 34 NOC for assessment, 19 NOC for planning, and 120 NIC for intervention. The relationships to NANDA-I diagnoses recorded 2,182 links and the triangulation returned 109 diagnoses, 54 of them for a critical situation. The panel of experts unanimously validated the 29 diagnoses with the highest number of links. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, involves a complex situation with multiple associated care problems that can be identified using the taxonomic triangulation technique. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The links between taxonomies and the taxonomic triangulation technique are an important tool for generating knowledge.

We aimed to investigate factors associated with prolonged and intermittent viral RNA shedding in a retrospective cohort of symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Methods: Demographic, clinical and laboratory data from hospitalised COVID-19 patients from a single centre with two consecutive negative respiratory reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were extracted from electronic medical records. KaplanCMeier survival curve analysis was used to assess the effect of clinical characteristics on the duration and pattern of shedding. Plasma levels of immune mediators were measured using Luminex multiplex microbead-based immunoassay. Results: There were 201 symptomatic patients included. Median age was 49 years (interquartile range 16C61), and 52.2% were male. Median RNA shedding was 14 days (IQR 9C18). Intermittent shedding was observed in 77 (38.3%). We did not identify any factor associated with prolonged or intermittent viral RNA shedding. Duration of shedding was inversely correlated with plasma levels of T-cell cytokines IL-1 and IL-17A at the initial phase of infection, and patients had lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines during intermittent shedding. Conclusions: Less active T-cell responses at the initial phase of infection were associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding, suggesting that early immune responses are beneficial to control viral load and prevent viral RNA shedding. Intermittent shedding is common and may explain re-detection of viral RNA in recovered patients.","output":"Associations of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding patterns with clinical illness and immune responses in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on cell proliferation activity of the human CCA cell lines. METHODS KKU-M139 and KKU-213B cell lines were used in this study. The cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. Lipid synthesis determined by Oil red O staining and colorimetric assay. An inverted phase-contrast light microscope was used to investigate the histological change of the cells. Caspases 3/7 activity and AnnexinV/PI were used to assess apoptosis by multiple microplate reader. RESULTS The results showed that ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac suppressed the viability of the KKU-M139 and KKU-213B cells in a dose-dependent manner, as measured especially diclofenac. However, these three NSAIDs slightly decreased lipid synthesis determined by Oil red O staining and colorimetric assay. The histological change observations showed the shrinking cell and become star-shaped in high dose treated groups. Interestingly, these NSAIDs exhibited in both of KKU-M139 and KKU-213B cell lines, the diclofenac-treated cells had the most injury cells. The cells exhibited cell injury features. In addition, the detection of caspase 3/7 and AnnexinV/PI in this investigation revealed early cell apoptotic characteristics. CONCLUSION These finding suggest that ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac suppress cell viability. The results reveal that ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac, which induce the histological change and apoptosis.

DESIGN Single institution and national registry retrospective cohort studies. SETTING John Hopkins level 1 adult and pediatric trauma center and National Trauma Data Bank. PATIENTS Patients 21 years and younger hospitalized following traumatic injuries at John Hopkins (1987-2011). Patients 21 years and younger in the National Trauma Data Bank (2008-2010 and 2011-2012). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Clinical characteristics of Johns Hopkins patients with and without venous thromboembolism were compared, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent venous thromboembolism risk factors. Weighted risk assessment scoring systems were developed based on these and previously identified factors from National Trauma Data Bank patients (2008-2010); the scoring systems were validated in this cohort from Johns Hopkins and a cohort from the National Trauma Data Bank (2011-2012). Forty-nine of 17,366 pediatric trauma patients (0.28%) were diagnosed with venous thromboembolism after admission to our trauma center. After adjusting for potential confounders, venous thromboembolism was independently associated with older age, surgery, blood transfusion, higher Injury Severity Score, and lower Glasgow Coma Scale score. These and additional factors were identified in 402,329 pediatric patients from the National Trauma Data Bank from 2008 to 2010; independent risk factors from the logistic regression analysis of this National Trauma Data Bank cohort were selected and incorporated into weighted risk assessment scoring systems. Two models were developed and were cross-validated in two separate pediatric trauma cohorts: 1) 282,535 patients in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2011 to 2012 and 2) 17,366 patients from Johns Hopkins. The receiver operating curve using these models in the validation cohorts had area under the curves that ranged 90-94%.

It was shown that the number of such malicious ASs is significantly larger than previously expected due to the lack of security guarantees in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). In response, recent works suggest alternative Tor path selection methods prefering Tor nodes with higher resilience to active BGP attacks. In this work, we analyze the implications of such proposals. We show that Counter-RAPTOR and DPSelect are not as secure as thought before: for particular users they allow for leakage of users location. DPSelect is not as resilient as widely accepted as we show that it achieves only one third of its originally claimed resilience and, hence, does not protect users from routing attacks. We reveal the performance implications of both methods and identify scenarios where their usage leads to significant performance bottlenecks. Finally, we propose a new metric to quantify the users location leakage by path selection. Using this metric and performing large-scale analysis, we show to which extent a malicious middle can fingerprint the users location and what kind of confidence it can achieve. Our findings shed light on the implications of path selection methods on the users anonymity and the need for further research.","output":"Security and Performance Implications of BGP Rerouting-Resistant Guard Selection Algorithms for Tor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the pathophysiology, management, and prevention of emerging infectious diseases among pregnant women is imperative to achieve a successful response from the medical community.

METHODS: All patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 21, 2020 to April 14, 2020 in Wuhan. We retrospectively analyzed the patients admitted to the ICU (137 patients) and general wards (114 patients) of Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital in China. The population characteristics, symptoms, and laboratory examination results between the patients in the ICU and those in the general wards were compared. Furthermore, the differences between the deceased patients in the ICU and those discharged from the ICU were compared. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, no presence of complications, presence of 1 complication, and presence of 3 or more complications (P<0.05). There were also significant differences between the patients in terms of the laboratory examination results including elevated urea nitrogen, creatinine, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, troponin I, phosphokinase isoenzyme-MB, and B-type natriuretic peptide; and decreased platelets, lymphocyte absolute value, and eosinophil absolute value (<0.05).

This study aims to fill this research gap for the Republic of Korea, which has over 10,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the nationwide health insurance claims data of 7590 confirmed COVID-19 patients, we estimated average medical expenses and inpatient days per patient, and performed multivariate negative binomial, and gamma regressions to determine influencing factors for higher outcomes. RESULTS: According to the results, COVID-19 patients with history of ICU admission, chest CT imaging, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine use stayed longer in the hospital and spent more on medical expenses, and anti-hypertensive drugs were insignificantly associated with the outcomes. Female patients stayed longer in the hospital in the over 65 age group but spent less in medical expenses that the 20C39 group. In the 40C69 age group, patients with health insurance stayed longer in the hospital and spent more on medical expenses than those aged over 65 years. Comorbidities did not affect outcomes in most age groups. CONCLUSION: In summary, contrary to popular beliefs, medical expenses and length of hospitalization were mostly influenced by age, and not by comorbidities, anti-viral, or anti-hypertensive drugs.

We aimed to assess whether patients with a systemic rheumatic disease might be at increased risk for hyperinflammation and respiratory failure from COVID-19. METHODS: We did a retrospective, comparative cohort study of patients aged 18 years or older admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 at Mass General Brigham (Boston, USA). We identified patients by a search of electronic health records and matched patients with a systemic rheumatic disease 1:5 to comparators. We compared individual laboratory results by case status and extracted laboratory results and COVID-19 outcomes for each participant. We calculated the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation score (cHIS), a composite of six domains (a score of 2 indicating hyperinflammation) and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 outcomes by hyperinflammation and case status. FINDINGS: We identified 57 patients with a systemic rheumatic disease and 232 matched comparators who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between Jan 30 and July 7, 2020; 38 (67%) patients with a rheumatic disease were female compared with 158 (68%) matched comparators. Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease had higher peak median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (96 [IQR 64C222] vs 78 [45C165]; p=0021), lactate dehydrogenase concentration (421 U/L [297C528] vs 345 U/L [254C479]; p=0044), creatinine concentration (12 mg/dL [09C20] vs 10 mg/dL [08C14], p=0014), and blood urea nitrogen concentration (31 mg/dL [15C61] vs 23 mg/dL [13C37]; p=0033) than comparators, but median C-reactive protein concentration (1494 mg/L [764C2753] vs 1163 mg/L [588C2259]; p=011) was not significantly different. Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease had higher peak median cHIS than comparators (3 [1C5] vs 2 [1C4]; p=0013). All patients with a peak cHIS of 2 or more had higher odds of admission to intensive care (OR 345 [95% CI 198C599]), mechanical ventilation (6620 [898C48780]), and in-hospital mortality (1637 [475C5638]) than patients with a peak cHIS of less than 2. In adjusted analyses, patients with a rheumatic disease had higher odds of admission to intensive care (208 [109C396]) and mechanical ventilation (260 [132C512]) than comparators, but not in-hospital mortality (1.78 [079C402]). Among patients who were discharged from hospital, risk of rehospitalisation (108 [037C316]) and mortality within 60 days (120 [058C247]) was similar in patients and comparators. INTERPRETATION: Patients with a systemic rheumatic disease who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 had increased risk for hyperinflammation, kidney injury, admission to intensive care, and mechanical ventilation compared with matched comparators. However, among patients who survived, post-discharge outcomes were not significantly different. The cHIS identified patients with hyperinflammation, which was strongly associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes in both patients with a rheumatic disease and comparators. Clinicians should be aware that patients with systemic rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 could be susceptible to hyperinflammation and poor hospital outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine seropositivity to the COVID-19 virus in patients attending NDTC, and to establish if patients tested had any clinical symptoms of this disease since March 2020. METHOD: All patients attending for OAT were invited to participate and 103/565 patients agreed. The patients were tested for the presence of serum antibodies to COVID-19 in a single sample collected over a 4-month period (JulyCOctober 2020). A questionnaire was administered at the same time as sample taking. RESULTS: Results showed that the majority of patient samples (100; 97%) tested were negative for the presence of antibodies to COVID-19. There were only two confirmed positive results (1.9%) and one equivocal result (1%). None of the approximately 565 attendees at the HSE NDTC presented with serious illness indicative of COVID-19 throughout the three waves of the pandemic, nor were any deaths due to COVID-19 reported. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate (a) possible low level of exposure to COVID-19 among this patient cohort or (b) that those patients who have been exposed have not developed or maintained detectable antibody levels, nor developed symptoms of the disease. Public health measures could explain the low level of COVID-19 in this cohort.

Then, a rheumatology nurse conducted a semi-structured interview and collected the patients perception about the understanding of the video, feasibility, capability and confidence in performing self-assessment using Likert-type items. The degree of confidence with self-assessment was correlated to the patients socio-demographic characteristics. Sixty-two patients were included and had an overall positive reaction to the video. It was easy to understand in 96% and helped facilitate self-assessment in 92% of cases. Self-assessment was considered totally feasible in 74%, and 66% of patients were capable of always doing it, with a confidence of 60% (always) to 34% (sometimes). Confidence was associated with a higher educational level. Nevertheless, 77% of patients felt that the self-assessment would not fully replace the physicians visit. Open-ended questions identified five themes: better understanding of the disease, easier communication with the rheumatologist, less consultation time, difficulty with the scoring part and importance of practice.

Samples of blood serum from 10 patients positive and 10 patients negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR RNA and ELISA tests were analyzed. Raman spectra were obtained with a dispersive Raman spectrometer (830 nm, 350 mW) in triplicate, being submitted to exploratory analysis with principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the spectral differences and discriminant analysis with PCA (PCA-DA) and partial least squares (PLS-DA) for classification of the blood serum spectra into Control and COVID-19. The spectra of both groups positive and negative for COVID-19 showed peaks referred to the basal constitution of the serum (mainly albumin). The difference spectra showed decrease in the peaks referred to proteins and amino acids for the group positive. PCA variables showed more detailed spectral differences related to the biochemical alterations due to the COVID-19 such as increase in lipids, nitrogen compounds (urea and amines/amides) and nucleic acids, and decrease of proteins and amino acids (tryptophan) in the COVID-19 group. The discriminant analysis applied to the principal component loadings (PC 2, PC 4, PC 5 and PC 6) could classify spectra with 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity indicated in the RT-PCR kit leaflet, demonstrating the possibilities of a rapid, label-free and costless technique for diagnosing COVID-19 infection.","output":"Diagnosing COVID-19 in human serum using Raman spectroscopy: a preliminary study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdowns of various forms have prompted higher education institutions (HEIs) to suddenly shift from physical face-to-face classes to e-learning environments on an unprecedented scale in recent history. This sudden shift promotes the continuity of the teaching-learning process in HEIs despite the COVID-19 pandemic, at most on the positive side, while bringing forth challenges related to individual learners and academics. This work is based on a recently reported Values-Enhanced Technology Adoption (VETA) model, which incorporates individual values in technology acceptance modeling. Despite offering crucial insights into academics in evaluating e-learning adoption, the current literature suffers from drawbacks. Motivated by addressing these limitations, this work reevaluates the nine constructs of the VETA model using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). Results indicate that effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, price value, habit, security, tradition, conformity, achievement, power, and hedonism constructs cause performance expectancy, behavioral intention, and social influence. The DEMATEL captures and models the causal relationships between these constructs within an analytical framework, which induces some variations of the recent empirical findings. Finally, the perception of self-achievement among academics drives the intention to adopt e-learning. The findings offered in this work are crucial to the evolving literature of COVID-19 on education, particularly in informing the design of initiatives and measures to enhance e-learning.","output":"Utilizing DEMATEL for Value-Embedded e-Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Escherichia albertii is characterized as an emerging pathogen, causing enteric infections.

Therefore, in current study, we aimed to identify potential vaccine candidates and design chimeric vaccine models against Escherichia albertii from the analysis of publicly available data of 95 strains, using a reverse vaccinology approach. Outer-membrane proteins (n = 4) were identified from core genome as vaccine candidates. Eventually, outer membrane Fimbrial usher (FimD) protein was selected as a promiscuous vaccine candidate and utilized to construct a potential vaccine model. It resulted in three epitopes, leading to the design of twelve vaccine constructs. Amongst these, V6 construct was found to be highly immunogenic, non-toxic, non-allergenic, antigenic, and most stable. This was utilized for molecular docking and simulation studies against six HLA and two TLR complexes.

This study aimed to detect, in such a period of crisis and changes, the role of organizational communication considering the mediating role of both technostress and self-efficacy, with psycho-physical disorders as outcome. The research involved 530 workers working from home. A Structural Equations Model was estimated, revealing that organizational communication is positively associated with self-efficacy and negatively with technostress and psycho-physical disorders. As mediators, technostress is positively associated with psycho-physical disorders, whereas self-efficacy is negatively associated. As regards mediated effects, results showed negative associations between organizational communication and psycho-physical disorders through both technostress and self-efficacy. This study highlighted the potential protective role of organizational communication that could buffer the effect of technostress and enhance a personal resource, self-efficacy, which is functional to the reduction of psycho-physical disorders.

Patients at risk are those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressed patients such as those undergoing treatment for hematological cancer or recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. COVID 19 infection is known to produce a state of hyper inflammation with release of various cytokines this state of immune dysfunction is associated with development of opportunistic infections, of which Mucormycosis is on the rise currently. The widespread use of corticosteroids can cause secondary infections including mucormycosis. CNS penetration typically starts with nasal involvement followed by the paranasal sinuses and palate, ultimately invading the orbit and brain or by direct hematological spread which is called as Rhino-orbito-cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM) . MATERIAL This is a cross sectional study conducted on 50 patients diagnosed with COVID 19 associated mucormycosis admitted to the hospitals attached to BMCRI from May2021 to August 2021.All the ROCM cases with CNS manifestation were included The relevant demographic data, clinical presentation, neurologic manifestations, underlying co morbidity, medical treatments, and surgical interventions done were recorded and analyzed. OBSERVATION A total of 50 patients were included mean age 49.3 year with 38 males and 12 females .Most common comorbidity was diabetes (94%)followed by hypertension (26%) .Most common symptom was headache (86%) followed by facial swelling (68%), facial pain (66%).40% Patients had CNS symptom among which most common was hemiparesis. EOM restriction(70%) and abnormal vision(70%) being most common examination finding. Most common sinus being involved was maxillary 94% followed by ethmoid sinus 92%. Neurological manifestation included acute infarct (56%), Cavernous sinus thrombosis (28%),ICA occlusion (10%) abscess (34%), 3 patients had dual fungal infection. 26% patient underwent craniotomy, 6%carniotomy with Denkers procedure, 30% underwent maxillectomy.

This study examines whether the benefits of team-based learning (TBL) regarding good teaching (i.e., perceived teaching quality), satisfaction, and performance persist when switching from face-to-face to online education. A quasi-experiment in an undergraduate advanced accounting course compared a non-COVID-19-affected semester to a COVID-19-affected semester. In both semesters, students could choose between a TBL and a LBL path for tutorial sessions. Quantitative survey data (N = 455) indicate TBL outperforms LBL, even when switching to online tools. Good teaching was perceived as even better in the COVID-19-affected semester, and even more so by students in the team-based setting, compared to the lecture-based setting.

The use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) across Canada varies across provinces and territories, partly because of differences in health care delivery models across these jurisdictions. A national program that coordinates uses of PROMs is needed to ensure that this information is comparable across jurisdictions. This commentary provides a summary look at the development of national PROMs data standards and reporting for hip and knee replacement surgery, including the selection of survey tools, building consensus, developing and promoting standards, and reporting on the results nationally and internationally as well as outlining recent learnings from regional implementation of data standards. In 2017, the Canadian Institute for Health Information published national PROMs data collection standards for hip and knee arthroplasty that included guidelines for survey time points, the minimum data set and PROMs instruments. This broad-scale PROMs collection initiative had stakeholder engagement and support from multiple levels within the health system, including administrators, clinic managers, patients, and health system decision-makers. Learnings from regional implementation of the standards demonstrated the importance of assessing existing infrastructure and information technology requirements, mapping clinical workflows, planning for human and information technology resources, navigating local legislation and hospital policies and ensuring data linkage capabilities. This initiative showed the need for a common regional approach for PROMs collection to be efficient and effective. The learnings from implementation of the national Canadian PROMs program for hip and knee arthroplasty can be used as an example for other jurisdictions and clinical areas such as renal care and mental health. Common data standards allow for secondary use of this data that is valuable for reporting and informing policy and guidelines as well as meeting care delivery goals to further the shift in health care systems becoming more patient-centred to improve the quality-of-life of patients.","output":"Advancing PROMs for health system use in Canada and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess demographic, clinical, and biomarker features distinguishing patients with Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); compare MIS-C sub-phenotypes; identify cytokine biosignatures; and characterize viral genome sequences. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective observational cohort study of 124 children hospitalized and treated under the institutional MIS-C Task Force protocol from March-September 2020 at Children's National, a quaternary freestanding Children's Hospital in Washington DC. Of this cohort, 63 of the patients had the diagnosis of MIS-C (39 confirmed, 24 probable) and 61 were from the same cohort of admitted patients who subsequently had an alternative diagnosis (controls). RESULTS: Median age and sex were similar between MIS-C and controls. Black (46%) and Latino (35%) children were overrepresented in the MIS-C cohort, with Black children at highest risk (OR 4.62, 95% CI 1.151-14.10; P = .007). Cardiac complications were more frequent in critically ill MIS-C (55% vs. 28%; p=0.04) including systolic myocardial dysfunction (39% vs. 3%; p=0.001), and valvular regurgitation (33% vs. 7%; p=0.01). Median cycle threshold (Ct) was 31.8 (27.95--35.1 IQR) in MIS-C cases, significantly higher (indicating lower viral load) than in primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cytokines siL2R, IL10, and IL-6 were higher in MIS-C compared with controls. Cytokine analysis revealed sub-phenotype differences between critically ill vs. noncritically ill (IL-2, sIL2R, IL-10, Il-6); PCR positive vs. negative (TNF-&#945;, IL10, IL-6), and presence vs. absence of cardiac abnormalities (IL-17). Phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences revealed predominance of GH clade originating in Europe, with no differences comparing MIS-C with primary COVID patients. Treatment was well tolerated, and no children died. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a well-characterized large cohort of MIS-C treated following a standardized protocol and identifies key clinical, biomarker, cytokine, viral load, and sequencing features.

If such microbes are active in karstic paddy soils, their activity would help increase soil organic carbon and mitigate As contamination. We therefore used gel-stabilized gradient systems to cultivate microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria from karstic paddy soil to investigate their capacity for Fe(II) oxidation, carbon fixation, and As sequestration. Stable isotope probing demonstrated the assimilation of inorganic carbon at a maximum rate of 8.02 mmol C m-2 d-1. Sequencing revealed that Bradyrhizobium, Cupriavidus, Hyphomicrobium, Kaistobacter, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, unclassified Phycisphaerales, and unclassified Opitutaceas were fixing carbon. Fe(II) oxidation produced Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides, which can absorb and/or coprecipitate As. Adding As(III) decreased the diversity of functional bacteria involved in carbon fixation, the relative abundance of predicted carbon fixation genes, and the amount of carbon fixed. Although the rate of Fe(II) oxidation was also lower in the presence of As(III), over 90% of the As(III) was sequestered after oxidation. The potential for microbially mediated As(III) oxidation was revealed by the presence of arsenite oxidase gene (aioA), denoting the potential of the Fe(II)-oxidizing and autotrophic microbial community to also oxidize As(III). Thisstudy demonstrates that carbon fixation coupled to Fe(II) oxidation can increase the carbon content in soils by microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, as well as accelerate As(III) oxidation and sequester it in association with Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides.","output":"Microaerophilic Oxidation of Fe(II) Coupled with Simultaneous Carbon Fixation and As(III) Oxidation and Sequestration in Karstic Paddy Soil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Balanced nutrition and appropriate dietary interventions are fundamental in the prevention and management of viral infections.

Young adults often engage in casual sexual relationships abroad, exhibit sexual risk behaviours and may thus be at risk of contracting sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections. Pre-travel interventions and consultations may mitigate this risk. At present, we know little about sexual health-related pre-travel interventions. The aim of this study was therefore to document key informants experiences, perceptions and recommendations in the context of sexual health of young adult travellers. METHODS: Key informants were professionals working in Ottawa, Canada travel clinics, travel organizations or sexual health clinics with a young adult clientele. This study used a qualitative approach and consisted of 13 in-person or Skype semi-structured interviews with key informants. Thematic content analysis was informed by a sexual health framework, with themes emerging both inductively and deductively. RESULTS: Sexual health was not common in pre-travel interventions described by key informants. Risk-assessment, and practical or purpose-driven pre-travel interventions were identified, resulting in risk mitigation strategies tailored to the destination region and/or mission/culture of the travel organization. Dissemination (e.g. limited time, lack of training) and uptake (e.g. young adults embarrassment, provider discomfort, financial constraints) barriers limited in-depth discussions of pre-travel interventions related to sexual health. Key informants acknowledged the importance of early sexual health education, and recommended ongoing, comprehensive sexual education for both youth and young adults. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that more time and resources should be allocated to the topic of sexual health during pre-travel interventions with young adults. Professionals who guide and prepare young adults for travel must develop concomitant skills in sexual health promotion. Early, comprehensive sexual education is recommended to improve overall sexual health in young adults and mitigate risk behaviours during travel.","output":"Key informant perspectives on sexual health services for travelling young adults: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data on the influence of age and body mass index (BMI) on energy metabolism of the critically ill are heterogeneous. Due to the increasingly aging critically ill population, investigation on age- and BMI-specific energy metabolism is relevant. METHODS: A total of 394 indirect calorimetry measurements were conducted on 348 critically ill adult medical patients, including 46 repeat measurements after 3.6  4.3 days. Measured resting energy expenditure (MREE) was compared for age groups, BMI, and gender. Predicted energy expenditure (PEE) using the Penn State, Swinamer, and Ireton-Jones equations and the ACCP recommendations was also compared with MREE. RESULTS: The patients were 65.6  14.5 years old. Their mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 27.6  7.8. Mean BMI was 27.8  8.4 kg/m(2), and 25.6% were obese. MREE adjusted for ideal body weight decreased with increasing age, while it increased with increasing BMI. Age, BMI, and gender are independent determinants of MREE after adjusting for clinical factors (R(2) = 0.34). All four prediction equations showed a proportional bias, with the Penn State equation performing acceptably. In 46 patients with repeat indirect calorimetry, there was no significant difference between the first and second MREE (p = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: Age, BMI, and gender are independent determinants of resting energy expenditure in critically ill adults. Variations between measured and predicted energy expenditure are considerable. Should prediction equations be used, their performance in the specific population should be taken into consideration. Repeat indirect calorimetry may not always be necessary.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the barriers to and facilitators of ovarian toxicity assessment in BC trials of anti-cancer drugs. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with purposively selected stakeholders from multiple countries involved in BC clinical trials (clinicians, consumers, pharmaceutical company representatives, members of drug-regulatory agencies). Participants were asked to describe the perceived benefits and barriers to evaluating ovarian toxicity. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded in NVivo software and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Saturation of the main themes was reached and the final sample size included 25 participants from 14 countries (9 clinicians, 7 consumers, 5 members of regulatory agencies, 4 pharmaceutical company representatives); half were female. The main reported barrier to ovarian toxicity assessment was that the issue was rarely considered. Reasons included that these data are less important than survival data and are not required for regulatory approval. Overall, most participants believed evaluating the impact of BC treatments on ovarian function is valuable. Suggested strategies to increase ovarian toxicity assessment were to include it in clinical trial design guidelines and stakeholder advocacy. CONCLUSION: Lack of consideration about measuring ovarian toxicity in BC clinical trials that include premenopausal women suggest that guidelines and stronger advocacy from stakeholders, including regulators, would facilitate its more frequent inclusion in future trials, allowing women to make better informed treatment decisions.","output":"Understanding the barriers to, and facilitators of, ovarian toxicity assessment in breast cancer clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had a widespread public health impact, thus causing a significant socioeconomic burden [...].","output":"What the Aftermath of the Global Pandemic Will Mean for Neurologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-native species threaten native ecosystems and species, particularly on islands where rates of endemism and vulnerability to threats are high.

In this study, we evaluated diagnostic ability of the HPI with invasively collected arterial blood pressure data in 41 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation. Predictive ability was evaluated at HPI thresholds from 0 to 100, at incremental intervals of 5.

Subsequently, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and time to event were determined for every threshold. Almost all patients (93%) experienced at least one hypotensive event. Median number of events was 21 [7C54] and time spent in hypotension was 114 min [20C303].

While estimates of CF rates for past influenza pandemics have ranged from about 0.1% (1957 and 1968 pandemics) to 2.5% (1918 pandemic), the official World Health Organization estimate for the current outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza to date is around 60%. METHODS AND RESULTS The official estimate of the H5N1 CF rate has been described by some as an over-estimate, with little relevance to the rate that would be encountered under pandemic conditions. The reasons for such opinions are typically: (i) numerous undetected asymptomatic/mild cases, (ii) under-reporting of cases by some countries for economic or other reasons, and (iii) an expected decrease in virulence if and when the virus becomes widely transmitted in humans. Neither current data nor current literature, however, adequately supports these scenarios. While the real H5N1 CF rate could be lower than the current estimate of 60%, it is unlikely that it will be at the 0.1-0.4% level currently embraced by many pandemic plans. We suggest that, based on surveillance and seroprevalence studies conducted in several countries, the real H5N1 CF rate should be closer to 14-33%. CONCLUSIONS Clearly, if such a CF rate were to be sustained in a pandemic, H5N1 would present a truly dreadful scenario.

Our goal was to detail the remodeling of a tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak and analyze pitfalls to avoid increasing surgical department burdens. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data affecting patients during their admission in our institution during March 2020. Data from general admission, intensive care units, and elective and emergency surgeries were collected and analyzed. All patients who underwent a surgical procedure were reviewed to elucidate limitations in the deployment of the hospital transformation to a COVID-19 hospital. RESULTS: A total of 688 patients have been treated in our institution. Of those, 186 required intensive care. More than 120 new intensive care beds have been created during this period, and a decrease in elective surgeries of more than 75% was observed. Inadvertent COVID-19 patients accounted for 70%. Thirty percent of the patients who underwent surgery while infected with COVID-19 died in our institution.

The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may be responsible for acute lung toxicity. Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT) induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of cartridge aerosol induced inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and cartridges, and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition, we determined at SARS-COV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges.

The present study describes the challenges and outcomes of non-elective neurosurgical procedures done on COVID-19 positive patients along with the modifications in neurosurgical practice during the pandemic. Methods: A retrospective study was done in the Department of Neurosurgery over a period of one year and three months. Demographic and clinical details including outcomes of the COVID-19 positive patients, who had undergone non-elective neurosurgical interventions, were collected. Results: Ten patients (3.8%) were COVID-19 positive out of 262 neurosurgical interventions done. The age of the patients ranged from 5 days to 78 years with five males and five females. Out of the 10 patients, five were neurotrauma cases including one patient of head injury with craniovertebral junction injury. The patient with craniovertebral junction injury underwent foramen magnum decompression with C1 lateral mass-C2 pedicle screw on the right and C0-C2 pedicle screw and rod fixation on the left. The rest of the neurotrauma cases underwent craniotomy or burr-hole craniostomy followed by evacuation. Only one patient (10%) had postoperative 30-day mortality. The rest nine patients (90%) survived the post-operative 30-day mortality. The various modifications incorporated in the neurosurgical practice included categorizing the emergency room into various zones, a separate operating theatre for COVID-19 patients, limiting the number of operating members as well as minor modifications in the operating procedures. Conclusions: The postoperative surgical outcome is favorable in COVID-19 positive patients with modifications of the existing neurosurgical practices.","output":"Challenges and Outcomes of COVID-19 Positive Neurosurgical Patients: An Institutional Experience With Emphasis on Modifications of Neurosurgical Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Ce travail a t effectu afin de proposer une nouvelle chelle de mesure permettant aux cellules dcoute et aux numros durgence affilis aux units dintervention dans le cadre de la pandmie du SARS-CoV2 de distinguer les sujets contamins par ce virus de ceux qui prsentent une anxit due aux circonstances du confinement Cette chelle permet galement de distinguer les sujets prsentant une anxit lgre de ceux prsentant une anxit svre qui a de fortes probabilits dvoluer en un trouble psychologique  part entire durant les mois qui suivront le dconfinement Hors de la priode de pandmie, cette chelle peut tre le meilleur alli de dpistage prcoce des troubles anxieux survenant chez le jeune adulte et le sujet ag et permet de cette fa?on de distinguer les sujets qui somatisent durant les consultations de ceux qui ont une atteinte organique Summary This work was carried out in order to propose a new measurement scale enabling help-lines and emergency numbers affiliated to the intervention units in the setting of the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic to distinguish subjects infected by this virus from those with anxiety resulting from the circumstances of lock-down This scale also makes it possible to distinguish subjects with mild anxiety from those with severe anxiety that has a high probability of developing into a fully-fledged psychological disorder in the months following the end of lock-down Outside the pandemic period, this scale could be a major asset for the early detection of anxiety disorders occurring in young adults and the elderly, thus making it possible to distinguish between subjects who are somatizing and those with an organic disorder","output":"Echelle de somatisation: faire la diffrence entre les sympt?mes du Covid-19 et la somatisation chez le jeune adulte et chez les sujets ags"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a lethal respiratory disease with its first case reported back in 2012 (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia). It is a novel, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA beta coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that was isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness. Later, it was found that this patient was infected with MERS. MERS is endemic to countries in the Middle East regions, such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. It has been reported that the MERS virus originated from bats and dromedary camels, the natural hosts of MERS-CoV. The transmission of the virus to humans has been thought to be either direct or indirect. Few camel-to-human transmissions were reported earlier. However, the mode of transmission of how the virus affects humans remains unanswered. Moreover, outbreaks in either family-based or hospital-based settings were observed with high mortality rates, especially in individuals who did not receive proper management or those with underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes and renal failure. Since then, there have been numerous reports hypothesising complications in fatal cases of MERS. Over the years, various diagnostic methods, treatment strategies and preventive measures have been strategised in containing the MERS infection. Evidence from multiple sources implicated that no treatment options and vaccines have been developed in specific, for the direct management of MERS-CoV infection. Nevertheless, there are supportive measures outlined in response to symptom-related management.

Here, we pursue a generalized mathematical model and cellular automata simulations to study the dynamics of infectious diseases and apply it in the context of the COVID-19 spread. Our model is inspired by the theory of coupled chemical reactions to treat multiple parallel reaction pathways. We essentially ask the question: how hard could the time evolution toward the desired herd immunity (HI) be on the lives of people? We demonstrate that the answer to this question requires the study of two implicit functions, which are determined by several rate constants, which are time-dependent themselves. Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of a quantitative understanding of the time-dependence of the outcome. Here, we compartmentalize the susceptible population into two categories, (i) vulnerables and (ii) resilients (including asymptomatic carriers), and study the dynamical evolution of the disease progression. We obtain the relative fatality of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable and resilient population and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment of herd immunity. We attempt to study and quantify possible adverse effects of the progression rate of the epidemic on the recovery rates of vulnerables, in the course of attaining HI. We find the important result that slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal.

Pain relief, using multimodal analgesia, is an integral component of any orchestrated approach to achieve clinically appropriate goals in critically ill patients. Sedative management, however, remains a significant challenge. Subsequent studies including most recent randomized trials have failed to provide strong evidence in favor of a sedative agent, a mode of sedation or ancillary protocols such as sedative interruption and sedative minimization. In addition, clinical practice guidelines, despite a comprehensive evaluation of relevant literature, have limitations when applied to individual patients. These limitations have been most apparent during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As such, there is a need for a mindset shift to a practical and achievable sedation strategy, driven by patients' characteristics and individual patient needs, rather than one cocktail for all patients. In this review, we present key principles to achieve patient-and symptom-oriented optimal analgesia and sedation in the critically ill patients. Sedative intensity should be proportionate to care complexity with due consideration to an individual patient's modifiers. The use of multimodal analgesics, sedatives, and antipsychotics agents-that are easily titratable-reduces the overall quantum of sedatives and opioids, and reduces the risk of adverse events while maximizing clinical benefits. In addition, critical considerations regarding the choice of sedative agents should be given to factors such as age, medical versus operative diagnosis, and cardiovascular status. Specific populations such as trauma, neurological injury, and pregnancy should also be taken into account to maximize efficacy and reduce adverse events.","output":"Optimal Sedation and Pain Management: A Patient- and Symptom-Oriented Paradigm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Despite concerns about cardiovascular implications in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, not all COVID-19 patients are visited by cardiologists and recommended to perform comprehensive cardiovascular assessments including measurement of biomarkers and echocardiography. We aimed to investigate the reasons for seeking cardiology care and to assess our cardiologists' diagnostic approaches to COVID-19 patients with potential cardiovascular involvement. Methods and Results: In this prospective, observational study, data of all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to six designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Iran in whom bedside cardiology consultation was requested were collected. A total of 148 patients including 105 (71%) males were included. The mean age was 57  17 years. The most common reasons for cardiology consultation were dyspnea (56.7%), chest pain (12.8%), and suspected arrhythmias (10.8%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (40.5%), diabetes mellitus (19.6%), and coronary heart disease (18.9%). A 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) was obtained in all patients. Point-of-care ultrasonography or limited transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in 106 (71.6%) patients, and complete TTE was performed in 35 (23.4%) patients. Cardiac troponin was measured in 63 (42.6%) patients, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level was measured in 34 (23%) patients.

Employing a dynamic model with district fixed effects, we analyze the association between these holidays and weekly incidence rates across 401 German districts. RESULTS: We find effects of the holiday period of around 45% of the average district incidence rates in Germany during their respective final week of holidays and the 2 weeks after holidays end. Western states tend to experience stronger effects than Eastern states. We also find statistically significant interaction effects of school holidays with per capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a district's population.

Objective To explore and determine which clinical variables could be associated with persistent respiratory symptoms, abnormal lung physiology, or radiographic abnormalities in patients recovering from COVID-19. Methods Using an electronic medical record, we query the pulmonary office system for patients evaluated for COVID-19 pneumonia between March and November 2020. A total of 150 patients were identified. 52% of the sample were males and 99% were Hispanics. 69% of patients (N=138) were previously hospitalized and the remaining ones were treated as ambulatory patients by their primary providers. Results From the sample, 68% (N=130) had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, 55% (N=150) presented hypertension and 41% (N=150) had diabetes. We observed that 68% (N=142) experienced persistent dyspnea on exertion (DOE) after 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. 71% (N=88) of the patients who experienced persistent DOE after 30 days had a BMI greater than 30.

METHODS All adult virtual clinical encounters from March-May 2020 with a principal diagnosis of ARS were reviewed for demographic data and the presence or absence of an antibiotic prescription during the coronavirus shut down in Massachusetts. In-person clinical encounters from March-May 2019 were similarly examined as a control. The rate of antibiotic prescription was compared between virtual (2020) and in-person (2019) visits for ARS diagnoses. RESULTS There were 2,075 patients in March-May 2020 and 3,654 patients March-May 2019 who received an ARS principal diagnosis at their virtual and in-person outpatient visits, respectively. There was a statistically significant lower rate of antibiotic prescriptions for ARS in 2020 (72.1%) versus 2019 (76.7%).The odds ratio for an antibiotic prescription for ARS was 0.783 (95% confidence interval, 0.693-0.86; p < 0.001) for patients seen in the 2020 cohort versus the 2019 cohort. The compared rates for antibiotic prescribing for 2020 versus 2019 were not different in individual month-to-month comparisons.

The full-blown COVID-19 can lead, in susceptible individuals, to premature death because of the massive viral proliferation, hypoxia, misdirected host immunoresponse, microthrombosis, and drug toxicities. Alike other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a neuroinvasive potential, which may be associated with early neurological symptoms. In the past, the nervous tissue of patients infected with other coronaviruses was shown to be heavily infiltrated. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 commonly report dysosmia, which has been related to the viral access in the olfactory bulb. However, this early symptom may reflect the nasal proliferation that should not be confused with the viral access in the central nervous system of the host, which can instead be allowed by means of other routes for spreading in most of the neuroanatomical districts. Axonal, trans-synaptic, perineural, blood, lymphatic, or Trojan routes can gain the virus multiples accesses from peripheral neuronal networks, thus ultimately invading the brain and brainstem. The death upon respiratory failure may be also associated with the local inflammation- and thrombi-derived damages to the respiratory reflexes in both the lung neuronal network and brainstem center. Beyond the infection-associated neurological symptoms, long-term neuropsychiatric consequences that could occur months after the host recovery are not to be excluded. While our article does not attempt to fully comprehend all accesses for host neuroinvasion, we aim at stimulating researchers and clinicians to fully consider the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which is likely to affect the peripheral nervous system targets first, such as the enteric and pulmonary nervous networks.

This has particularly been seen in infections caused by herpesviruses and respiratory viruses. The implementation of universal preventive measures against cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza (by means of antiviral prophylaxis and vaccination, respectively) and administration of early antiviral treatment have reduced the burden of these diseases and potentially their role in affecting allograft outcomes.

For example, in HIV vaccine development, immune response profiles induced by vaccination are key for selecting vaccine regimens to advance to efficacy evaluation. Motivated by the need to rank and choose a few vaccine regimens based on their immunogenicity in phase I trials, Huang et al. (Biostatistics 18(2):230C243, 2017) proposed a ranking/filtering/selection algorithm that down-selects vaccine regimens to satisfy the superiority and non-redundancy criteria, based on multiple immune response endpoints. In practice, many candidate immune response endpoints can be correlated with each other. An important question that remains to be addressed is how to choose a parsimonious set of the available immune response endpoints to effectively compare regimens. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for selecting immune response endpoints to be used in regimen down-selection, based on importance weights assigned to individual endpoints and their correlation structure. We show through extensive simulation studies that pre-selection of endpoints can substantially improve performance of the subsequent regimen down-selection process. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated using a real example in HIV vaccine research, although the methods are also applicable in general to clinical research for dimension reduction when comparing regimens based on multiple candidate endpoints.

Since then researchers worldwide have been struggling to detect the possible pathogenesis of this disease. COVID-19 showed a wide range of clinical behavior from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome. However, the etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury is not yet fully understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme1 (ACE1) convert angiotensin I into Angiotensin II that was further metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2). The binding ACE2 receptor to SARS-CoV-2 facilitate its enter into the host cell. The interaction and imbalance between ACE1 and ACE2 play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of ACE1 I/D polymorphism with severity of Covid-19. The study included RT-PCR confirmed 269 cases of Covid-19. All cases were genotyped for ACE1 I/D polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction and followed by statistical analysis (SPSS, version 15.0). We found that ACE1  genotype, frequency of D allele, older age (&#8805;46 years), unmarried status, and presence of diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patient. ACE1 ID genotype was significantly independently associated with high socio-economic COVID-19 patients (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.331-4.609).

The data on burnout, demand and resources at work and the perceived threat of COVID-19 were compiled in the second fortnight of April 2020 using an online questionnaire. We used several hierarchical linear regression models. RESULTS Work overload, material and human resources and social support at work were significant in explaining burnout. The perceived threat of COVID-19 variable was also significant and presented the highest regression coefficient ( =. 392). The perceived threat of COVID-19 moderated the relationship between social support at work and burnout. CONCLUSION The perceived threat of COVID-19 helped to explain the degree of burnout in nurses and moderated the relationship between social support at work and burnout.

Anova Health Institute (Anova) is the PEPFAR (US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) District Support Partner for the Johannesburg, Cape Town, Sedibeng, Capricorn and Mopani districts in South Africa, operating in public sector primary healthcare facilities. At the time of the emergence of COVID-19, Anova employed close to 4 000 people: 41% community health workers (CHWs), 23% data staff, 20% nurses and doctors, 12% management/support and 5% allied HCWs. OBJECTIVES To describe rates of COVID-19 diagnosis in Anova-employed HCWs in five districts. METHODS Employees exposed to, tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 were required to report the event. These reports were compiled into a database to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce. We kept a timeline of key events occurring at national and district level, including Anova's policies and their implementation, that was used to describe organisational response. We described the number of confirmed cases, cumulative incidence rates and testing rates, broken down by district and job category. We estimated expected deaths and the effect on time off work. RESULTS Of Anova employees, 14% (n=562) were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the end of September 2020. Cumulative incidence was highest in Sedibeng (29%) and lowest in Mopani (5%). All HCWs experienced high incidences: data staff 17%, allied HCWs 16%, CHWs 14%, nurses and doctors 13%, and management/support 11%. At the peak of the epidemic, for 5 weeks, >5% of employees were unable to work owing to exposure or infection, significantly disrupting service delivery. The additional administrative burden on managers was substantial. CONCLUSIONS It is critical that all cadres of HCWs are protected in the workplace, including in primary care settings, where better structuresare needed to perform risk assessments and conduct outbreak investigations. CHWs and data staff may be at higher risk owing to poor infrastructure, limited power to negotiate working conditions, and limited experience of infection prevention and control.

Using the three item loneliness scale (UCLA), loneliness was measured. According to the WHO thresholds, obesity was defined as BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2. Asymmetric fixed effects (FE) regressions were used. RESULTS: Conventional FE regression analysis revealed that changes in obesity status were associated with changes in loneliness (men: ? = -.19, p < .05; women: ? = .19, p < .05). Asymmetric FE regressions showed that in men the onset of obesity was associated with a decrease in loneliness (? = -.31, p < .05), whereas the end of obesity was not associated with loneliness. Asymmetric FE regressions showed that in women, the onset of obesity was associated with an increase in loneliness (? = .33, p < .01), whereas the end of obesity was not associated with loneliness.

Methods: The triage process used to resume the medical activities for gynecologic patients at the Wuhan Union Hospital after a 76-day lockdown of the city is described and its effectiveness to avoid COVID-19 nosocomial transmission is shown. Results: The non-emergency patients are pre-triaged by contact history and body temperature at outpatient clinic and negative COVID-19 screening tests are required for an admissionin the buffering rooms at the gynecologic department. The buffering lastsfor at least three days for symptom monitoring and a second round of COVID-19 tests before they can be transferred to the regular gynecologic wards. For patients who need emergency surgery, the first screening should be completed at the quarantine wards after the surgery, followed by buffering at the gynecologic department. We received 19298 outpatient visits, admitted 326 patients, and performed 223 operations in the first two months after the lockdown was lifted, andno single COVID-19 case occurredin the hospitalized patients while the proportion of potentially high-risk patients with cancer and severe anemia were increased in comparison with the same period in 2019 and the latest two months before the lockdown.

A successful bench to bedside innovation requires trust in the scientific research, open research and clinical facilities, and participation of patients in clinical studies. In addition, stay-at-home orders and the shutdown of elective medical and surgical care and research laboratories diminished opportunities for the informal interactions that are part of the new product development process. The pandemic and how it was managed prolonged the length of time for creation, adoption, and diffusion of new products and services into the market. Furthermore, the loss of hospital revenues from canceled elective care translates into a much smaller market for new technologies. Looking forward, critical success factors for innovation include federal policy that supports science and offers access and insurance coverage for health care, including addressing social determinants of health. Any further shutdowns of research and clinical care will hinder necessary collaborations between scientists, clinicians, and patients. Economic recovery is required to ensure federal and corporate funding for research and development.

The purpose of this study was to investigate ENT-drug interactions with three nucleoside analogs remdesivir, molnupiravir and its active metabolite, EIDD-1931 and four non-nucleoside molecules repurposed as antivirals for COVID-19. The study used 3D pharmacophores for ENT1 and ENT2 substrates and inhibitors and Bayesian machine learning models to identify potential interactions with these transporters. In vitro transport experiments demonstrated that remdesivir was the most potent inhibitor of ENT-mediated [3H] uridine uptake (ENT1 IC50: 38.65 mM; ENT2 IC50: 76.72 mM), followed by EIDD-1931 (ENT1 IC50: 258.9 mM; ENT2 IC50: 467.3 mM), while molnupiravir was a modest inhibitor (ENT1 IC50: 701.0 mM; ENT2 IC50: 851.4 mM). Other proposed antivirals failed to inhibit ENT-mediated [3H] uridine uptake below 1 mM. Remdesivir accumulation decreased in the presence of NBMPR by 30% in ENT1 cells (p = 0.0248) and 27% in ENT2 cells (p = 0.0054). EIDD-1931 accumulation decreased in the presence of NBMPR by 77% in ENT1 cells (p = 0.0463 ) and by 64% in ENT2 cells (p = 0.0132), supporting computational predictions that both are ENT substrates which may be important for efficacy against COVID-19. NBMPR failed to decrease molnupiravir uptake, suggesting that ENT interaction is likely inhibitory. Our combined computational and in vitro data can be used to identify additional ENT-drug interactions to improve our understanding of drugs that can circumvent the BTB. Significance Statement Significance statement: This study identified remdesivir and EIDD-1931 as substrates of equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 and 2. This provides a potential mechanism for uptake of these drugs into cells and may be important for antiviral potential in the testes and other tissues expressing these transporters.","output":"Remdesivir and EIDD-1931 Interact with Human Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporters 1 and 2: Implications for Reaching SARS-CoV-2 Viral Sanctuary Sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mass testing tactic is among the main strategies to fight a virus pandemic.

In this sense, there is a growing interest in developing devices with high sensitivity, selectivity, and fast detections. With this purpose, nanobiosensors are presented as a promising alternative, produced from nanomaterials with different structures and properties. On biosensing, NMs comprise transduction elements (transducers) associated with biomarkers to recognize and amplify different signals when interacting with biological material. The primary transducers involve optical and electrochemical methods. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and carbon-based, such as graphene, graphene oxide, and carbon nanotube (CNT), make up most NMs used in biosensing. For such application, the use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and quantum dots (QDs) of different compositions, such as the basis of cadmium and tellurium (CdTe QDs), are also widely studied. In addition to applications in biosensing, nanomaterials can be applied in biomarker immobilization and extraction procedure in standard tests such as RT-PCR and LFIA (ELISA).

APN participates in tumor cell expansion and motility, and is a target for cancer therapies. Small drugs that bind to the APN active site inhibit catalysis and suppress tumor growth. APN is also a major cell entry receptor for coronavirus, which binds to a region distant from the active site. Three crystal structures that we determined of human and pig APN ectodomains defined the dynamic conformation of the protein. These structures offered snapshots of closed, intermediate and open APN, which represent distinct functional states. Coronavirus envelope proteins specifically recognized the open APN form, prevented ectodomain progression to the closed form and substrate hydrolysis. In addition, drugs that bind the active site inhibited both coronavirus binding to cell surface APN and infection; the drugs probably hindered APN transition to the virus-specific open form. We conclude that allosteric inhibition of APN functions occurs by ligand suppression of ectodomain motions necessary for catalysis and virus cell entry, as validated by locking APN with disulfides. Blocking APN dynamics can thus be a valuable approach to development of drugs that target this ectoenzyme.","output":"Allosteric inhibition of aminopeptidase N functions related to tumor growth and virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we propose an age-structured susceptible-infectious-susceptible epidemic model with nonlocal (convolution) diffusion to describe the geographic spread of infectious diseases via long-distance travel.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study of mental states was carried out using three valid methods, namely: a clinical questionnaire for the detection and evaluation of neurotic states (K. Yakhin, D. Mendelevich), a questionnaire for diagnosing the level of social frustration (L. Wasserman, adaptation of V. Bojko), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Ch. Spielberger, adaptation by Yu. Khanin). The author's questionnaire (L. Borysenko) was used to study the connection between the factors of online learning and emotional states of students. The obtained empirical data were subjected to qualitative and quantitative processing. RESULTS: Results: The analysis of the obtained data allows to state the fact of predominance of high and increased level of situational and personal anxiety in the subjects in the conditions of online learning. In the process of psychodiagnosis of neurotic states, it was found that most students have a level of painful or borderline mental conditions such as anxiety, neurotic depression, asthenia and autonomic disorders. It was found that students have an elevated level and high level of social frustration. The main factors of online learning, which, according to students, cause them to deteriorate mental health are: forced to stay in a confined space, lack of direct social contacts, prolonged stay in a static position, increased study load and volume of tasks, anxiety for academic success and quality professional training, concern for their health and the health of their loved ones. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The forced transition to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental state of many students. In most respondents, this manifested itself in increased anxiety, depression, autonomic reactions due to limited opportunities to communicate with teachers and classmates, new learning conditions and increased workload.","output":"Study of the Mental State of Students in the Process of Online Education during the Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously impacting health and economies all over the world. With more than 8 million diagnosed cases and close to 450.000 deaths worldwide by mid-June 2020, the need of safe and effective treatments is extremely urgent. Drug repurposing is a suitable approach to bring new treatments to the clinics in a very fast and cost-effective way. METHODS: We have applied an artificial intelligence screening technology based on molecular fields to find drugs that could inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) among a library of compounds with clinical experience, approved drugs and drugs in clinical development. The results were refined by covalent docking at the catalytic domain of the protein and thirty compounds were chosen for experimental validation on a protease assay with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The compounds were also tested for their inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Positive hits were further tested in a VeroE6 cell infection assay with pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 using nucleocapsid protein staining at 24h post infection as a readout. RESULTS: Eravacycline was identified at the top positions of the screening and its potent inhibitory activity was demonstrated in vitro against recombinant SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL proteases, with IC50 of 1.65, 10.04 and 16.36 M respectively. In addition, eravacycline inhibited infection of VeroE6 cells by pathogenic strains of SARS-CoV-2, with an IC50 of 30.61 M in the absence of drug induced cell toxicity. CONCLUSION: Eravacycline is an FDA and EMA-approved antibiotic that was launched in the US in 2018. It is a safe drug that is known to accumulate in the lungs at concentrations that are compatible with its in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. This, together with its known antibacterial activity that could help prevent secondary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and the known anti-inflammatory actions of tetracyclines, warrant further research on the potential role of eravacycline for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 or infected with SARS-CoV-2 but with milder symptoms.

METHODS: Hospitalized patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis code for COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) from 1 April to 31 October 2020 were identified in the Premier Healthcare COVID-19 Database. Patient demographics, hospitalization characteristics, and concomitant medical conditions were assessed. Hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, hospital charges, and hospital costs were evaluated overall and stratified by age groups, insurance types, and 4 COVID-19 disease progression states based on intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) usage. RESULTS: Of the 173,942 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 63 years, 51.0% were male, and 48.5% were covered by Medicare. The most prevalent concomitant medical conditions were cardiovascular disease (73.5%), hypertension (64.8%), diabetes (40.7%), obesity (27.0%), and chronic kidney disease (24.2%). Approximately one-fifth (21.9%) of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU and 16.9% received IMV; most patients (73.6%) did not require ICU admission or IMV, and 12.4% required both. The median hospital LOS was 5 days, in-hospital mortality was 13.6%, median hospital charges were $43,986, and median hospital costs were $12,046. Hospital LOS and in-hospital mortality increased with ICU and/or IMV usage and age; hospital charges and costs increased with ICU and/or IMV usage. Patients with both ICU and IMV usage had the longest median hospital LOS (15 days), highest in-hospital mortality (53.8%), and highest hospital charges ($198,394) and hospital costs ($54,402).

We also undertook Poisson regression analyses to estimate if changes in purchases differed by household socio-demographic and economic factors. Excess off-trade household alcohol purchases (expressed as grams of ethanol) following the introduction of confinement, were 29.2% higher (95% CI = 25.8% to 32.5%) for the post-confinement months of 2020, being larger until mid-July 2020 (37.5%, 95%CI = 33.9 to 41.26%) when pubs re-opened with restrictions, and smaller (24.6%, 95%CI = 21.6 to 27.7) thereafter. During the time of complete pub closures, and fully adjusting for no on-trade purchases, household purchases of alcohol did not change when compared with the same time period during 2015C2019 (coefficient = -0.9%, 95%CI = -5.6 to 3.8). Excess purchases from 23(rd) March to 31(st) December 2020 varied by region of Great Britain, being higher in the north of England, and lower in Scotland and Wales. Excess purchases were greater in the most deprived households, compared with the least deprived households. Excess purchases increased substantially as the amount of alcohol normally purchased by a household increased, with the top one fifth of households that normally bought the most alcohol increasing their purchases more than 17 times than the bottom one fifth of households that bought the least alcohol. That the heaviest buyers of alcohol increased their purchases the most, with some independent impact of socio-economic disadvantage, might explain why reported alcohol problems and recent alcohol-related death rates might have increased. A conclusion of this is that alcohol policy to reduce high consumption of alcohol, and the availability of help and treatment to reduce alcohol consumption become more important during extraordinary times, such as COVID lockdowns.","output":"The COVID-19 alcohol paradox: British household purchases during 2020 compared with 2015-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article critically studies coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic news in the press.

The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of isatuximab monotherapy in a phase 2, multicenter, one-arm, open-label study in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL or T-LBL (Clinical Trials.gov identifier NCT02999633). The primary endpoint was to assess the efficacy of isatuximab by overall response rate (ORR). An interim analysis based on the efficacy and safety of isatuximab in the first 19 patients enrolled was scheduled, however only 14 patients were enrolled in the study. No patient achieved complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete peripheral recovery. Most patients (11 [78.6%]) developed progressive disease and had progressive disease as their best response. A total of 10 (71.4%) patients had treatment emergent adverse events considered treatment-related, with infusion reactions as the most frequent drug-related TEAE, occurring in 8 (57.1%) patients. Despite the low efficacy of isatuximab in the current study, it is likely that the use of immunotherapy medication in T-ALL will be expanded through logically targeted approaches, together with advances in the design of T-cell therapy and clinical experience and will provide restorative options beyond chemotherapy and targeted treatments.","output":"Isatuximab monotherapy in patients with refractory T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-lymphoblastic lymphoma: Phase 2 study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trees and herbs that produce fruits represent the most valuable agricultural food commodities in the world. However, the yield of these crops is not fully achieved due to biotic factors such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Viruses are capable of causing alterations in plant growth and development, thereby impacting the yield of their hosts significantly. In this work, we first compiled the worlds most comprehensive list of known edible fruits that fits our definition. Then, plant viruses infecting those trees and herbs that produce fruits with commercial importance in the global market were identified. The identified plant viruses belong to 30 families, most of them containing single-stranded RNA genomes. Importantly, we show the overall picture of the host range for some virus families following an evolutionary approach. Further, the current knowledge about plant-virus interactions, focusing on the main disorders they cause, as well as yield losses, is summarized. Additionally, since accurate diagnosis methods are of pivotal importance for viral diseases control, the current and emerging technologies for the detection of these plant pathogens are described. Finally, the most promising strategies employed to control viral diseases in the field are presented, focusing on solutions that are long-lasting.","output":"Viruses Infecting Trees and Herbs That Produce Edible Fleshy Fruits with a Prominent Value in the Global Market: An Evolutionary Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The purpose of the study was to compare the refractive error measurements of pediatric patients performed with a Plusoptix A09 photorefractor (PO; Plusoptix AG, Nuremberg, Germany), a Retinomax K-plus 3 (RTX; Right Group, Tokyo, Japan), and the new handheld auto refracto-keratometer, the Nidek HandyRef-K (HDY; Nidek SA, Crteil, France), and to evaluate the intermethods agreement. Methods: A total of 194 eyes of 194 children were included in the study. All of the children underwent refraction measurement with the PO before cycloplegia and 2 autorefractors were used after cycloplegia: the RTX and the HDY. Results: The mean age of the patients was 16.6510.04 months (range: 3-34 months). There were no statistically significant differences between the spherical values (SV) or cylindrical axis values (CAV) measured with the PO (SV: 1.611.79 diopters [D]; CAV: 94.2572.47 D), the RTX (SV: 1.912.06 D; CAV: 94.373.44 D), and the HDY (SV: 1.892.04 D; CAV: 93.5573.71 D) (p>0.05).There was a statistically significant difference in the cylindrical values (CV) assessed with the RTX (CV: -0.970.75 D) and the HDY (CV: -1.110.76 D) (p=0.003) and the HDY and the PO (CV: -0.920.68 D)(p=0.002), while there was no statistically significant difference between the values determined with the RTX and the PO (p>0.05). Statistically significant differences were demonstrated for spherical equivalent values (SEV) obtained with the RTX (SEV: 1.431.97 D) and the PO (SEV: 1.151.74 D) (p=0.02), and the HDY (SEV: 1.341.95 D) and the PO (p=0.03), but no significant difference was found between the RTX and the HDY values (p>0.05). Conclusion: No significant difference was found between the SEV measured by the RTX and the HDY, but the PO was significantly less hyperopic than the RTX and the HDY. The CV measured by HDY was higher than that of other devices. These devices can be used for screening in crowded pediatric ophthalmology clinics and may be an easier way of measuring refractive errors in children younger than 3 years of age, but high SEV and CV results should serve as an alert to physicians. It should also be kept in mind that cycloplegic retinoscopy is still the gold standard and these alternative methods can only be used for screening. The prescription of eyeglasses should not be made without cycloplegic retinoscopy.","output":"HandyRef-K: Comparison of the Latest Handheld Auto Refracto-keratometer with Retinomax and Plusoptix in Patients Younger than Three Years of Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), generating high numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths, is still circulating in 2021 with new variants of the coronavirus, such that the state of emergency remains in manifold countries. Currently, there is still a lack of a full understanding of the factors determining the COVID-19 diffusion that clarify the causes of the variability of infections across different provinces and regions within countries. The main goal of this study is to explain new and main determinants underlying the diffusion of COVID-19 in society. This study focuses on international trade because this factor, in a globalized world, can synthetize different drivers of virus spread, such as mobility patterns, economic potentialities, and social interactions of an investigated areas. A case study research is performed on 107 provinces of Italy, one of the first countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Statistical analyses from March 2020 to February 2021 suggest that total import and export of provinces has a high association with confirmed cases over time (average r > 0.78, p-value <.001). Overall, then, this study suggests total import and export as complex indicator of COVID-19 transmission dynamics that outclasses other common parameters used to justify the COVID-19 spread, given by economic, demographic, environmental, and climate factors. In addition, this study proposes, for the first time, a time-dependent correlation analysis between trade data and COVID-19 infection cases to explain the relation between confirmed cases and social interactions that are a main source of the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent negative impact in society. These novel findings have main theoretical and practical implications directed to include a new parameter in modelling of the diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic to support effective policy responses of crisis management directed to constrain the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and similar infectious diseases in society.","output":"International trade as critical parameter of COVID-19 spread that outclasses demographic, economic, environmental, and pollution factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of novel antibodies to combat the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is ongoing.

Outcomes for patients with poor immune responses receiving antibody therapy for underlying disease and SARS-CoV-2 severe infection are undergoing investigation. The objective of this study was to perform a search on patients with poor immune responses with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, to assess if antibody therapy is beneficial in such populations. We performed searches using PubMED and medrXiv up to May 2021 of patients with solid and hematologic malignancy, SOT patients and acquired or congenital immunodeficiency. The primary outcome was to assess if antibody therapy was included during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes of such treatment in this population. Here we find that there is a repurposing of monoclonal antibodies to target cytokine release syndrome, along with the use of convalescent plasma (CP). Despite CP demonstrating promising results, we reiterate evidence that CP forces mutational escape and subsequent variant development. Repurposing of antibody therapies (such as Tocilizumab) proved effective, especially in SOT patients. This also potentially opens an avenue for the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; however, studies have yet to focus on patients with poor immune responses as a subpopulation.","output":"The development of biologics to target SARS-CoV2: Treatment potential of antibodies in patient groups with poor immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims at the ability of teachers who are digital immigrants to use digital technology during their learning at home during the Covid19 pandemic.

While the majority of individuals who have experienced traumatic bereavements do not meet formal criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), or prolonged grief disorder (PGD), the degree of distress and dysfunction for these bereaved can be quite significant. The assessment and intervention paradigms in use with traumatic bereavements often prioritize the trauma and bypass the centrality of the interpersonal loss. By using a bifocal approach in conceptualizing bereavement, the Two-Track Model of Bereavement (TTMB) rebalances the approach to the class of traumatic bereavements. Track I examines biopsychosocial functioning and symptoms of trauma, and track II focuses on the nature of the ongoing relationship with the deceased and the death story that may also have elements of traumatic response. The model and its application serve to identify both adaptive and maladaptive responses to loss along both axes to optimally focus interventions where needed. The story of the death, the psychological relationship with the deceased, and the presence of biopsychosocial difficulties each have a part to play in assessment and intervention. A case study of assessment and intervention following traumatic bereavement due to suicide illustrates how attention to each of these factors in the TTMB can facilitate change. Ultimately, the relational bond with the deceased is a major vector in grief and mourning.

Between May and July 2010 an epidemic of respiratory disease swept through the population. Initial microbiological investigations ruled out known equine viral agents as the cause of the infections, but identified the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus zooepidemicus as being frequently isolated from diseased animals. This diverse bacterial species has a broad host range and is usually regarded as a commensal of horses. By genome sequencing S. zooepidemicus recovered from horses during the epidemic we show that although multiple clones of S. zooepidemicus were present in the population, one particular clone, ST209, was responsible for the epidemic. Concurrent with the epidemic, ST209 caused zoonotic infections, highlighting the pathogenic potential of this clone. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the original ST209 strain entered Iceland in late 2008 or early 2009. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the incursion of this strain into a training yard that utilized a submerged treadmill between the 5th and 19th of February 2010 was a critical trigger for the ensuing epidemic of disease, provided a nidus for the infection of multiple horses, and subsequent distribution of these animals to multiple sites in Iceland.","output":"Genomic Dissection of an Icelandic Epidemic of Equine Respiratory Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe congenital heart disease (CHD) affecting 1 in 5000 newborns.

The interactome is available on a webserver with advanced search capabilities. A total of 364 genes including 73 novel interactors were differentially regulated in tissue/iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes of HLHS patients. Novel PPIs facilitated the identification of TOR signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress modules. We found that 60.5% of the interactome consisted of housekeeping genes that may harbor large-effect mutations and drive HLHS etiology but show limited transmission. Network proximity of diabetes, Alzheimers disease, and liver carcinoma-associated genes to HLHS genes suggested a mechanistic basis for their comorbidity with HLHS. Interactome genes showed tissue-specificity for sites of extracardiac anomalies (placenta, liver and brain). The HLHS interactome shared significant overlaps with the interactomes of ciliopathy- and microcephaly-associated genes, with the shared genes enriched for genes involved in intellectual disability and/or developmental delay, and neuronal death pathways, respectively.

Microbiological diagnosing of VZV cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection was performed on stored CSF samples using mNGS, quantitative and qualitative VZV-specific PCR assays, and VZV IgM antibodies test. RESULTS: The median age was 30.0 [interquartile range (IQR), 24.3-33.3] years. 51.6% of the patients were men. About 80.6% of the patients had normal CSF white blood cell counts ( 5  106/L). VZV IgM antibodies presented in 16.1% of the CSF samples, and nucleic acids were detectable in 16.1 and 9.7% using two different VZV-specific real-time PCR protocols. Intriguingly, maximal identification of VZV elements was achieved by CSF mNGS (p = 0.001 and p = 007; compared with qualitative PCR and VZV IgM antibody test, respectively), with sequence reads of VZV being reported in 51.6% (16/31) of the CSF samples. All VZV PCR positive samples were positive when analyzed by mNGS. Of note, human betaherpesvirus 6A with clinical significance was unexpectedly detected in one CSF sample.

Planktonic cultures of both species were cultured under aerobic conditions for 24 h followed by treatment with MB or TMPyP at various concentrations for an incubation period of 10 min and subsequent irradiation for 10 min. Ability to replicate was evaluated by CFU assay. Accumulation of PS was measured using a spectrophotometer. The cytoplasmic membrane integrity was investigated by flow cytometry using SYBR Green and propidium iodide. In experiments on the replication ability of bacteria after photodynamic treatment with TMPyP or MB, a killing rate of 5 log10 steps of the bacteria was achieved. Concentration-dependent accumulation of both PS was shown by spectrophotometric measurements whereby a higher accumulation of TMPyP and less accumulation of MB was found for S. aureus as compared to E. coli. For the first time, a membrane-damaging effect of TMPyP and MB in both bacterial strains could be shown using flow cytometry analyses.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize evidence on the impact of remote consultation in primary care with regard to antibiotic prescribing. METHODS: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, HMIC, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for literature published since the databases inception to February 2020. Peer-reviewed studies conducted in primary health care settings were included. All remote consultation types were considered, and studies were required to report any quantitative measure of antibiotic prescribing to be included in this systematic review. Studies were excluded if there were no comparison groups (face-to-face consultations). RESULTS: In total, 12 studies were identified. Of these, 4 studies reported higher antibiotic-prescribing rates, 5 studies reported lower antibiotic-prescribing rates, and 3 studies reported similar antibiotic-prescribing rates in remote consultations compared with face-to-face consultations. Guideline-concordant prescribing was not significantly different between remote and face-to-face consultations for patients with sinusitis, but conflicting results were found for patients with acute respiratory infections. Mixed evidence was found for follow-up visit rates after remote and face-to-face consultations.

It evoked a vigorous response in clinical medicine, as it required rapid development and delivery of COVID\\\\19 vaccines in less than a year (Le et al., 2020). Similarly, medical education also adapted with the same rate and intensity as its clinical counterparts. Infection control and mitigation measures evolved to limit viral spread. The CDC issued stay\\\\at\\\\home orders and directives to close non\\\\essential places. This included medical schools, which are considered high population density (CDC, 2021). Consequently, traditional in\\\\person didactics were compromised; educational delivery went to socially\\\\distanced online modes. Remote online\\\\learning of medical education includes video conferences for lectures, assessments of diagnostic and clinical skills via online modes, and virtual\\\\simulation use to aid problem\\\\based learning. Adaptive online\\\\learning for medical education boosts strong cooperation from faculty and students to meld curriculum to retain competency and accreditation requirements for students to graduate and become physicians. This study examines online lecture effectiveness during COVID\\\\19, specifically pathology, as medical students shift to optimize learning for board exam preparation and transition to clinical settings. METHODS: In this preliminary study, second year medical students at a US osteopathic medical school were anonymously surveyed in 2020\\\\2021 academic year. Target demographic was medical students required to use online learning due to COVID\\\\19; students had live, in\\\\person instruction in previous academic year, 2019\\\\2020, until the shift to online learning started March 2020. Data from survey included quantitative data on effectiveness of online learning versus in\\\\person lecture for medical students, impact of online learning on students foundational pathology preparation for board exams, and students' abilities to apply pathology knowledge with diagnostic reasoning in a clinical setting. Preliminary results show online learning of pathology in preparation for board exams elicited moderate confidence from 58% of second\\\\year medical students; a majority of students to report online learning as quite effective. Ninety\\\\two percent of students used external pathology resources (review books, video series, etc.) with online learning. However, more than half of students report low confidence in applying pathology knowledge in a clinical setting.

In this paper, we extend this study to more general situations, namely, multiphenotype symmetric as well as asymmetric matrix games with random payoffs. Conditions for stochastic local stability and stochastic evolutionary stability are established. Conditions for a fixation state to be stochastically unstable and almost everywhere stochastically unstable are distinguished in a multiphenotype setting according to the initial population state.

While novel drugs are being developed, azithromycin has been identified as a candidate treatment in the interim. AIM: To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches were conducted on 16 April 2020 of PubMed, TRIP, EPPI COVID Living Map, MedRxiv, GoogleScholar, and Google. In vivo and in vitro studies were included assessing the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, and/or the activity of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo studies needed to include a comparator group. RESULTS: Three studies were identified, two in vitro and one in vivo, which were suitable for inclusion. All three were published as pre-prints. The in vitro studies revealed conflicting results, with one finding anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for azithromycin alone, while the other found activity against SARS-CoV-2 only when azithromycin was combined with hydroxychloroquine. A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection. There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established.

Thymidine kinase is a proliferation marker downstream of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 pathway. We prospectively investigated the prognostic role of serum thymidine kinase activity (sTKa), in patients treated with Palbociclib + fulvestrant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PYTHIA was a phase II, single-arm, multicentre, trial that enrolled 124 post-menopausal women with endocrine-resistant hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Serum samples were collected pre-treatment (pre-trt; n = 122), at day 15 of cycle 1 (D15; n = 108), during the one week-off palbociclib before initiating cycle 2 (D28; n = 108) and at end of treatment (n = 76). sTKa was determined centrally using Divitum?, a refined ELISA-based assay with a limit of detection of 20 Divitum Units (Du)/L. The primary study endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed for its association with pre- and on-treatment sTKa. RESULTS: Data from 122 women were analysed. Pre-treatment sTKa was not associated with clinical characteristics and moderately correlated with tissue Ki-67. Palbociclib + fulvestrant markedly suppressed sTKa levels at D15, with 83% of patients recording levels below limit of detection. At D28, sTKa showed a rebound in 60% of patients. At each timepoint, higher sTKa was associated with shorter progression-free survival (each p < 0.001), with the strongest effect at D15. CONCLUSIONS: STKa is an independent prognostic biomarker in patients treated with palbociclib. High pre-treatment sTKa and its incomplete suppression during treatment may identify patients with poorer prognosis and primary resistance. This warrants validation in prospective comparative trials.

MCR-3 generally mediates low-level (8 mg L-1 ) colistin resistance among Enterobacteriaceae, but occasionally confers high-level (>128 mg L-1 ) resistance in aeromonads. Herein, it is determined that MCR-3, together with another lipid A modification mediated by the arnBCADTEF operon, may be responsible for high-level colistin resistance in aeromonads. Lipid A is the critical site of pathogens for Toll-like receptor 4 recognizing. However, it is unknown whether or how MCR-3-mediated lipid A modification affects the host immune response. Compared with the wild-type strains, increased mortality is observed in mice intraperitoneally-infected with mcr-3-positive Aeromonas salmonicida and Escherichia coli strains, along with sepsis symptoms. Further, mcr-3-positive strains show decreased clearance rates than wild-type strains, leading to bacterial accumulation in organs. The increased mortality is tightly associated with the increased tissue hypoxia, injury, and post-inflammation. MCR-3 expression also impairs phagocytosis efficiency both in vivo and in vitro, contributing to the increased persistence of mcr-3-positive bacteria in tissues compared with parental strains. This study, for the first time, reveals a dual function of MCR-3 in bacterial resistance and pathogenicity, which calls for caution in treating the infections caused by mcr-positive pathogens.","output":"Mobile Colistin Resistance Enzyme MCR-3 Facilitates Bacterial Evasion of Host Phagocytosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mutation of just one gene will cause abnormal cell behavior leading to the synthesis of a dysfunctional protein.

In this regard, in seeking the understanding of factors related to protection and susceptibility to infection, this review aimed to discuss the influence of sex hormones on the immune response to leishmaniases. In the literature, sex hormone variations promote differences in the innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immune response, leading to greater susceptibility, mortality, and complications in males. Epidemiological estimates confirm these results, showing a predominance of the disease, in its different clinical forms, in men and suggesting that sexual variations influence immunomodulatory mechanisms since the prevalence of cases comprises the post-puberty and adulthood period. In this perspective, the action of sex hormones has been investigated in different clinical models, highlighting the potential of testosterone in immunosuppression, given its association with greater susceptibility and poor control of parasite load and the induction of cell apoptosis and attenuation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, hormonal variations influence the immune response among males and females against leishmaniases, in which androgens may present immunosuppressive potential, while steroids present immunomodulatory characteristics.","output":"The influence of sex hormones on the immune response to leishmaniasis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Emerging infectious diseases are an important problem in medicine, and many continue to pose a global threat.

Calves were block-randomized by time to one of three treatments: 1) placebo, 2) zinc methionine (ZM), or 3) zinc sulfate (ZS) administered in milk once daily for 14 days. Serum total protein at enrollment and body weight at birth, treatment end, and hutch exit were measured. Fecal consistency was assessed daily for 28 days post-enrollment. For a random sample of 127 calves, serum zinc concentrations before and after treatment and a fecal antigen ELISA at diarrhea start and resolution for Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum were performed. Linear regression showed that ZM-treated bull calves had 22 g increased ADG compared to placebo-treated bulls (P = 0.042). ZM-treated heifers had 9 g decreased ADG compared to placebo-treated heifers (P = 0.037), after adjusting for average birth weight. Sex-stratified models showed that high birth weight heifers treated with ZM gained more than placebo-treated heifers of the same birth weight, which suggests a dose-response effect rather than a true sex-specific effect of ZM on ADG. Cox regression showed that ZM and ZS-treated calves had a 14.7% (P = 0.015) and 13.9% (P = 0.022) reduced hazard of diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves.

We captured data from 29 provinces, including numbers of COVID-19 cases, meteorological parameters, air quality and population flow data, between Jan 21, 2020 and Apr 3, 2020. To evaluate the transmissibility of COVID-19, the basic reproductive ratio (R0) was calculated with the maximum likelihood \\"removal\\" method, which is based on chain-binomial model, and the association between COVID-19 and air pollutants or meteorological parameters was estimated by correlation analyses. The mean estimated value of R0 was 1.79  0.31 in 29 provinces, ranging from 1.08 to 2.45. The correlation between R0 and the mean relative humidity was positive, with coefficient of 0.370. In provinces with high flow, indicators such as carbon monoxide (CO) and 24-h average concentration of carbon monoxide (CO_24 h) were positively correlated with R0, while nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 24-h average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2_24 h) and daily maximum temperature were inversely correlated to R0, with coefficients of 0.644, 0.661, -0.636, -0.657, -0.645, respectively.

Of 2318 interviewees who received the invitation, 1576 finished a qualifying questionnaire, corresponding to a response rate of 68.0%. RESULTS The majority of respondents (n=1435 [91.1%]) were willing to accept a booster vaccination against COVID-19. History of allergic reaction to other vaccines (OR= 0.30), confidence in the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines (OR= 3.20), confidence in the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (OR =2.25) and its variants (useful versus [vs.] useless, OR =2.33), and vaccine recipients (OR =3.09) remained significantly associated with willingness to accept a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines. CONCLUSION A moderate proportion of participants who responded were willing to receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

So far there is no consensus for drug treatment to stop the spread of the virus. Discovery of a drug that would limit the virus expansion is one of the biggest challenges faced by the humanity in the last decades. In this perspective, to test existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a good approach. Among natural phenolic compounds found in plants, fruit, and vegetables; flavonoids are the most abundant. Flavonoids, especially in their glycosylated forms, display a number of physiological activities, which makes them interesting to investigate as antiviral molecules. The flavonoids chemical structures were downloaded from PubChem and protease structure 6LU7 was from the Protein Data Bank site. Molecular docking study was performed using AutoDock Vina. Among the tested molecules Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside showed the highest binding affinity (-9,7 kcal/mol). Docking studies showed that glycosylated flavonoids are good inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 protease and could be further investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments for further validation. MD simulations were further performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior and stability of the protein in complex with the three best hits of docking experiments. Our results indicate that the rutin is a potential drug to inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro) of Coronavirus.","output":"Potential bioactive glycosylated flavonoids as SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors: A molecular docking and simulation studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the relationship between foreign investment and the containment measures, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 spread.

Foreign investors highly rate the implementation of strong containment measures - as measured by government stringency index - in countries with high risk - as measured by the risk of openness index.

Forty healthy Caucasian men were included from a group of genotyped individuals. Cardio- and cerebrovascular variables at baseline and during a 60-min adrenaline infusion (0.06 g kg-1 min-1) were measured by Model flow, near-infrared spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler sonography. Blood samples were obtained from an artery and a retrograde catheter in the right internal jugular vein.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Blastocysts were securely stored, effectively warmed and safely transferred to yield normal pregnancy outcomes under uncertain laboratory conditions subject to unprecedented policy changes. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: By April 2020, every IVF lab worldwide was implementing deep cleaning/disinfecting procedures in their laboratory and patient-contact areas, thorough hand-washing policies and mandatory PPE to reduce the chance of contact transmission and spread of the potentially deadly SARS-CoVC2 coronavirus. Furthermore, we know that safeguards like oil overlay culture dishes and pipetting dilution factors provide insurance against possible contamination. However, knowing that the trophectoderm of blastocysts possessed the ACEC2 binding receptor, potential concern existed regarding the continuation of laser zona opening and biopsy procedures that could possibly expose cryopreserved embryos to the coronavirus in liquid nitrogen storage (vapor or liquid). STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between March 8 and December 22, 2020, 508 patients performed FET cycles involving the use of single (n = 490) or dual (n = 18) euploid microSecure vitrified blastocysts. In this retrospective analysis, we compared clinical pregnancy outcomes to a 5 year dataset (2015C2019) encompassing 2768 single and 272 dual embryo transfer FET cycles. All blastocysts were vitrified using a closed microSecure system and Innovative Cryoenterprise (ICE; NJ, USA) non-DMSO, glycerol-EG solutions. Differences were assessed by Chi-square analysis (p < 0.05). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Deep cleaning was performed with Simple Green Pro3+ Virucide in non-lab areas (e.g., ET rooms, waiting room) and 6% H2O2 & OoSafe solutions to disinfect lab surfaces and equipment. Group embryo cultures were performed in MCOC5M humidified incubators under low oxygen tri-gas conditions with varying CO2 levels (5.3C6.0%; pH = 7.3C7.35) using 25l droplets of LifeGlobal medium+7.5%LGPS+1%sodium hyaluronate, before changing to 10l droplet/GPS dishes post-biopsy. FET cycles involved 4-step sucrose dilutions and transvaginal ultrasound-guided embryo transfers. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: While ICSI fertilization rates were unchanged in 2020 (79.4% 2PN vs 77.3%), blastocyst utilization rates tended to be slightly lower than past years (56.4% vs 59.9%) but within an acceptable range. Of 529 blastocysts warmed, 527 (99.7%) survived completely for transfer, being comparable to the 99.4% experienced over 5 years. Furthermore, there was no differences detected in single embryo transfer pregnancy outcomes. The implantation and ongoing clinical pregnancy/live birth rates were 69% and 66.53% compared to 70.4% and 65.1%, respectively. Under pandemic conditions we did not observe an increase in biochemical pregnancies (10.3%) nor spontaneous miscarriage rates (7.8%). Although it is possible that our rigorous disinfection practices could have attributed to lower blastocyst production, the viability of those embryos was not compromised. Importantly, we were able to feel comfortable performing micromanipulation and cryopreservation procedures throughout the year knowing that we were effectively eliminating possible vertical transmission of coronavirus to an exposed trophectoderm layer in cryostorage by applying mircoSecure vitrification. Post-FET clinical check-ups revealed no patient reporting any fever or other CovidC19 symptoms in the weeks following their transfers. We are fortunate to say that our Lab staff, physicians and patients have remained healthy throughout 2020. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Blastocyst survival and viability are independent of possible viral exposure. Previously, the risk of disease transmission via liquid nitrogen or vapor exposure was considered highly unlikely (Pomeroy et al., 2010), but that was at a time when embryos were primarily zona-enclosed. Todays ART standards have us re-evaluating safer approaches. Wider implications of the findings: We have effectively mitigated avoiding performing zona opening procedures by employing our standard practice of aseptic, closed vitrification. In combination with standard preventative measures (PPE, hand hygiene, distance awareness) and routine deep cleaning practices, we sustained a contamination-free environment and healthy patients, capable of sustaining high levels of pregnancy success.

Binge drug use (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.71) and drug type (methamphetamine vs. others) (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.22-1.77) were positively associated with the borrowing of already used syringes among PWID. We also found that drug type (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.16-1.64) and homelessness (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.27-2.51) had a positive association with the lending of already used syringes among PWID. Additionally, being HIV positive was negatively associated with the lending of used syringes among PWID (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.63).

This study aimed to investigate the differences in characteristics between suicide cases in Hong Kong that occurred at home and elsewhere; identify at-home suicide hotspots in the community and compare the differences in area-level characteristics between suicide hotspots and other areas. METHODS: Suicide cases (2013-2017) were identified from Hong Kong Coroner's Court reports. Area-level socioeconomic data were retrieved from the 2016 Hong Kong census. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, 2 tests and multiple logistic regression models were applied to compare differences in characteristics between people committing suicide at home and elsewhere. Global hotspot tests (Moran's I and Getis-Ord General G) and local analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) identified at-home suicide community hotspots. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare differences in area-level characteristics between at-home suicide hotspots and non-hotspots. RESULTS: About 60% of suicide cases in Hong Kong occurred at home. Being female, widowed and/or living alone were significant predictors of at-home suicide cases. A U-shaped association between age and at-home suicide was identified, with 32 years of age being the critical turning point. An at-home suicide hotspot was identified in the north-western region of Hong Kong, which had lower median household income, higher income inequality and higher percentages of households with single elderly people, and new arrivals, compared with other areas. CONCLUSION: Suicide prevention should start at home by restricting access to suicide methods. Community-based suicide prevention interventions with improvement of social services should target vulnerable members in identified suicide hotspots.","output":"Home as the first site for suicide prevention: a Hong Kong experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organizational leaders can make a large, positive impact on their employees during crises. However, existing research demonstrates that social support is not always effective in helping employees cope with stress, and existing research has not fully identified features of support attempts that determine their effectiveness. Using mixed methods, the authors investigate the efficacy of organizational leaders support efforts during a crisis. In the first study, 571 employees (196 university administrative staff, 192 licensed nurses, and 183 licensed engineers) described actions their leaders engaged in to support them during a global pandemic. Nine themes differentiated helpful from unhelpful leadership support: autonomy, changes, communication, personal resources, safety, timing, tone, work equipment, and workload. Study 2 used a quantitative methodology (162 licensed nurses and 239 licensed engineers) to demonstrate that leadership actions employees deemed as helpful in Study 1 were associated with less employee burnout and fewer physical symptoms. Drawing from emerging social support literature and the stressor-strain model, the findings inform optimal leadership support practices during crises.","output":"How Can Organizational Leaders Help?

The present study investigated the relationship between self-perception of fitness (SPF) and PAL in COVID-19-recovered individuals (CRI). Methods: The population of this descriptive-analytical study included all CRI (men and women, in the age range of 20 to 70 years) in Kermanshah. In the present study, 890 volunteers (438 men and 452 women) were sampled using a multistage cluster sampling method. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) was used to assess the PAL and the Delignieres et al. questionnaire to assess the SPF. The Pearson correlation coefficient test and independent t-test were used to analyze the data using SPSS version 24 software. Results: The results showed low PAL (men: 876.11 +/- 40.23;women: 739.27 +/- 8.02) and poor SPF (men: 6.64 +/- 1.62;women: 5.27 +/- 1.39) in CRI. Also, there was a significant positive relationship between high and moderate PAL and SPF in men (r = 0.67, P = 0.032;r = 0.77, P = 0.018, respectively) and women (R= 0.56, P = 0.041;r = 0.66, P = 0.035, respectively), while there was a significant inverse relationship between low PAL and SPF among men (r = -0.85, P= 0.001) and women (r = -0.89, P= 0.001). Conclusions: Based on the results, wrong SPF in individuals with low PAL might be one reason for being insufficiently active.

The main research problem of the paper is formulated in the form of a question concerning the impact of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of the Zielony in Poland in commercial transactions by entities belonging to the local currency system. In order to achieve the objective and solve the main problem, the article uses such research methods as: the method of critical analysis of literature, historical method, statistical method, comparative method, observational method, free expert interview, as well as analysis and synthesis, deduction and induction and abstraction. We conducted a critical analysis of the literature and analysis of statistical data of the complementary currency Zielony in Poland in the period from March 2015 to June 2021, and the results of the expert interview showed that this currency is not a tool to support the functioning of local economy entities during non-financial crises, such as COVID-19 pandemic. This is influenced by, among other things, full or partial lockdown and other restrictions on the functioning of commercial entities during a pandemic. The consequences of such solutions include the weakening of economic activity and a decrease in the value of turnover of entities operating in various sectors of the local economy, especially entities of a service nature, which constitute about 80% of the structure of the Zielony complementary currency system in Poland. The main conclusion resulting from the conducted research is as follows: the complementary currency Zielony in Poland can influence the creation of local entrepreneurship and sustainable development and support the activities of the sector of small- and medium-sized enterprises, but these benefits are possible to achieve primarily in conditions of stable and undisturbed functioning of the economy. The realization of the payment function of the complementary currency, the Zielony, and its use in payments of entities belonging to those industries covered by lockdown and other administrative restrictions is impossible (or insignificant) at this time due to the absence (or hindered) of its circulation in the economy. The research results and conclusions presented in the article meet the assumptions of the application objective and can provide the entities of the micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprise sector with knowledge about the dependencies resulting from the use of the complementary currency in the lockdown period by the entities that implement the assumptions of the system of complementary currencies.","output":"The Complementary Currency Zielony in Poland and Its Importance for the Development of Local Economy Entities during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cancer patients had been profoundly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19 especially after quarantine restrictions in China We aimed to explore the treatment changes and delays of early breast cancer (EBC) during the first quarter of 2020 Methods: We did this retrospective, multicentre, cohort study at 97 cancer centres in China EBC patients who received treatment regardless of preoperative therapy, surgery or postoperative therapy during first quarter of 2020 were included Findings: 8397 patients were eligible with a median age of 50 (IQR 43C56) 02% (15/8397) of EBC patients were confirmed as COVID-19 infection Only 52% of breast cancer diagnosis occurred after quarantine in Hubei compared with 153% in other provinces (OR= 030, 95%CI 024C038) postoperative endocrine therapy were least affected compared with different regions after quarantine (OR=037 [95%CI 019C073]) The proportion of surgery decreased from 164% in December last year to 26% in February in Hubei Compared with intervals from diagnosis to treatment before quarantine restrictions, the average time increased with significance from 35 to 77 days in Hubei and 57 to 77 days in other provinces (p&lt; 0001) There were also 185 and 72 days delay in Hubei and other provinces respectively when calculating interval from surgery to postoperative therapy Interpretation: EBC from high risk regions had a comparative rate of COVID-19 infection After implementation of COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, fewer diagnosis and surgery with significant delays were seen when compared with treatment before Funding: Beijing Medical Award Foundation (YJ0120)","output":"Suboptimal declines and delays in early breast cancer treatment after COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in China: A national survey of 8397 patients in the first quarter of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Our paediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) team's pathway to address the educational needs of children with CF was based on a systems approach that benefited from coordinated, holistic, personalised foci adapting multidisciplinary and inter-agency working (BASW'20).

It can cause adverse health effects such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and high mortality rates. High population density is a huge contributory factor of air pollution in cities and urbanized areas.

Appropriate personal protection for medical staffs is critical. For ocular protection, there is ongoing hot debate and concern for potential ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Ocular manifestations and positive detection of viral RNA in ocular samples were only reported in very small number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, health care workers need to face patients more closely and have higher risk of aerosol contamination. Thus, appropriate ocular protection for medical workers is still recommended by organizations such as WHO and American Academy of Ophthalmology. Although eye goggles provide excellent protection and are mandatory for medical practitioners with high risk of exposure, they are not ideal for common clinical practice, because they can disturb vision due to extensive formation of water droplets and frequently cause moderate to severe discomfort after longtime wearing, which have been reported to interfere with working status. For the majority of medical workers who don't deal with high risk patients, they are not advised to wear goggles in daily practice. However, they also face the risk of infection due to the presence of asymptomatic carriers. Especially in situations with high risk of ocular exposure, such as close physical examination, eye surgery, dental clinics and surgery, ocular protection may be needed. Griffithsin has been shown to directly bind to spike proteins and has anti-viral activity against a broad spectrum of viruses, including coronavirus. Griffithsin is found to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV at relatively low concentration and is stable and non-toxic. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share the same entry receptors and their spike proteins are similar in conformation. We hypothesize that contact lenses containing nanoparticles loaded with griffithsin may provide sufficient ocular protection for medical staffs without high risk of exposure during the outbreak period of SARS-CoV-2. If proven effective, griffithsin-loaded contact lens can be considered as a supplementary ocular protective equipment for medical workers who can tolerate well. The daily disposable contact lens should be applied as needed and refrain from extended wearing in order to reduce potential side effects.","output":"The Need for Ocular Protection for Health Care Workers During SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak and a Hypothesis for a Potential Personal Protective Equipment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND An intriguing potential clinical use of cerebral oximeter measurements (SctO2) is the ability to noninvasively estimate jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2). Our purpose in this study was to determine the accuracy of the FORE-SIGHT(?) (CAS Medical Systems, Branford, CT), which is calibrated to a weighted average of 70% (SjvO2) and 30% arterial saturation, for Food and Drug Administration pre-market approval 510(k) certification by adapting an industry standard protocol, ISO 9919:2005 (www.ISO.org) (used for pulse oximeters), and to evaluate the use of SctO2 and SpO2 measurements to noninvasively estimate jugular venous oxygen saturation (SnvO2). METHODS Paired blood gas samples from the radial artery and the jugular venous bulb were collected from 20 healthy volunteers undergoing progressive oxygen desaturation from 100% to 70%. The blood sample pairs were analyzed via co-oximetry and used to calculate the approximate mixed vascular cerebral blood oxygen saturation, or reference SctO2 values (refSctO2), during increasing hypoxia. These reference values were compared to bilateral FORE-SIGHT SctO2 values recorded simultaneously with the blood gas draws to determine its accuracy. Bilateral SctO2 and SpO2 measurements were then used to calculate SnvO2 values which were compared to SjvO2. RESULTS Two hundred forty-six arterial and 253 venous samples from 18 subjects were used in the analysis. The ipsilateral FORE-SIGHT SctO2 values showed a tolerance interval (TI) of [-10.72 to 10.90] and Lin concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) with standard error (SE) of 0.83  0.073 with the refSctO2 values calculated using arterial and venous blood gases. The ipsilateral data had a CCC of 0.81 + 0.059 with TI of [-9.22 to 9.40] with overall bias of 0.09%, and amplitude of the root mean square of error after it was corrected with random effects analysis was 2.92%. The bias and variability values between the ipsilateral and the contralateral FORE-SIGHT SctO2 measurements varied from person to person. The SnvO2 calculated from the ipsilateral SctO2 and SpO2 data showed a CCC  SE of 0.79  0.088, TI = [-14.93 to 15.33], slope of 0.98, y-intercept of 1.14% with SjvO2 values with a bias of 0.20% and an Arms of 4.08%. The SnvO2 values calculated independently from contralateral forehead FORE-SIGHT SctO2 values were not as correlated with the SjvO2 values (contralateral side CCC + SE = 0.72  0.118, TI = [-14.86 to 15.20], slope of 0.66, and y-intercept of 20.36%). CONCLUSIONS The FORE-SIGHT cerebral oximeter was able to estimate oxygen saturation within the tissues of the frontal lobe under conditions of normocapnia and varying degrees of hypoxia (with 95% confidence interval of [-5.60 to 5.78] with ipsilateral blood sample data). These findings from healthy volunteers also suggest that the use of the calculated SnvO2 derived from SctO2 and SpO2 values may be a reasonable noninvasive method of estimating SjvO2 and therefore global cerebral oxygen consumption in the clinical setting.

The primary objective of the COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention Trial with lopinavir/ritonavir (CORIPREV-LR) is to evaluate the efficacy of a 14-day course of oral lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP against COVID-19 among individuals with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case. METHODS: This is an open-label, multicenter, 1:1 cluster-randomized trial of LPV/r 800/200 mg twice daily for 14 days (intervention arm) versus no intervention (control arm), using an adaptive approach to sample size calculation. Participants will be individuals aged > 6 months with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case within the past 7 days. A combination of remote and in-person study visits at days 1, 7, 14, 35, and 90 includes comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, microbiologic, and serologic sampling. The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection within 14 days after exposure, defined as a positive respiratory tract specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes include safety, symptomatic COVID-19, seropositivity, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, mortality, psychological impact, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses will examine the impact of LPV/r on these outcomes in the subset of participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. To detect a relative risk reduction of 40% with 80% power at  = 0.05, assuming the secondary attack rate in ring members (p(0)) = 15%, 5 contacts per case and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.05, we require 110 clusters per arm, or 220 clusters overall and approximately 1220 enrollees after accounting for 10% loss-to-follow-up. We will modify the sample size target after 60 clusters, based on preliminary estimates of p(0), ICC, and cluster size and consider switching to an alternative drug after interim analyses and as new data emerges. The primary analysis will be a generalized linear mixed model with logit link to estimate the effect of LPV/r on the probability of infection. Participants who test positive at baseline will be excluded from the primary analysis but will be maintained for additional analyses to examine the impact of LPV/r on early treatment. DISCUSSION: Harnessing safe, existing drugs such as LPV/r as PEP could provide an important tool for control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, this substitution may provide an advantage for viral spreading. To explore the mechanism, we analyzed 18 viral isolates containing S proteins with either G614 or D614 (S-G614 and S-D614, respectively). The plaque assay showed a significantly higher virus titer in S-G614 than in S-D614 isolates. We further found increased cleavage of the S protein at the furin substrate site, a key event that promotes syncytium formation, in S-G614 isolates.

OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of higher tidal volumes (HVt) compared to moderate Vt (MVt) in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) facility on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. SETTING AIR facility in the United States. METHODS Eighty-four adults with SCI were divided into MVt group if maximum Vt received in AIR was <15 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) and HVt group if maximum Vt was >15 ml/kg PBW. Primary outcomes were incidence of pneumonia and composite pulmonary adverse events (pneumonia, weaning failure, or acute care transfers due to respiratory complications). Secondary outcomes were AIR preweaning days defined as time from AIR admission to beginning of weaning, weaning days defined as days from start to end of weaning, and AIR ventilator days calculated as days on ventilator from AIR admission to discharge. RESULTS MVt was utilized in 50 patients and HVt was utilized in 34 patients. The risk of pneumonia in HVt group was 4.3 times higher [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-12] compared to MVt group. Odds of pulmonary adverse events in HVt group was 5.4 times higher (CI: 1.8-17) compared to MVt group. There was no difference in preweaning days, weaning days, or AIR ventilator days between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that HVt is associated with increased risk of pneumonia and higher odds of pulmonary adverse events in tracheostomized patients with SCI which warrants further investigation.","output":"Comparing outcomes of mechanical ventilation with high vs. moderate tidal volumes in tracheostomized patients with spinal cord injury in acute inpatient rehabilitation setting: a retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Young adulthood is the period from the late teens through the twenties and is associated with life transitions that could contribute to the development of obesity.

Using a cross-sectional survey, the current paper aimed to examine self-reported changes in eating patterns and behaviour during the lockdown in the UK, and associations with BMI, demographic variables, eating styles, health anxiety, food insecurity and coping strategies. Participants (N = 620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies. These findings suggest that changes to eating behaviour may be part of a wider style of maladaptive or adaptive coping, particularly in those with a history of EE or uncontrolled eating. Preparing individuals to adopt more adaptive coping strategies during lockdown situations may be crucial to improving health during subsequent the lockdown events.","output":"Eating in the lockdown during the Covid 19 pandemic; self-reported changes in eating behaviour, and associations with BMI, eating style, coping and health anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses present a substantial global disease burden, causing damage to populations health, economy, and social well-being.

The change in habits and the potential exposure to a dangerous virus can be categorized as a catastrophic event, which are usually traumatic and therefore have psychological consequences for the people involved. OBJECTIVE: Assuming the COVID-19 pandemic as a possible traumatic event, this study aims to explore the contingent behavioural and psychological impact of COVID-19 spread and related lockdown on the Italian general population, through measuring anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms . METHODS: An ad hoc-survey was set up for the this exploratory research, including the standardized Italian versions of the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) and the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), and ad hoc items concerning behavioural reactions due to the pandemic spread and related mass quarantine. Participants were recruited across convenient web-based and mobile app channels using a snowball sampling technique. Data was collected from March 25th to May 1st, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: One-thousand one hundred and ninety-five individuals (851 women and 342 men) completed 60% or more of the survey and were considered for analyses. Mean age was 40 years (s.d. = 14.948). Participants resided in 78 Italian provinces (out of 107 territorial divisions), with 25.7% residing in the Milan province and 9.2% from the Monza and Brianza provinces, closest to the epicentre of the Italian outbreak. RESULTS: During the worst months of the first wave of the Pandemic, the Italian population suffered high level of distress (GAD-7 m = 6.89, s.d. = 5.08; IER-R mean score = 27.86, s.d. 17.46), respectively indicating mild presence of anxiety symptoms, and high levels of PTSD symptoms. Gender seems to be a discriminating variable with women scoring significantly higher than man, both for anxiety symptoms (H (1) = 82.91, p < .001) and all dimensions of PTSD symptoms (intrusion H (1) = 71.23, p < .001, avoidance H (1) = 61.28, p < .001), and hyperarousal (H (1) = 67.348, p < .001). People from Generations Y and Z show to be at higher risk of developing PTSD (V = .746, F (3,1041) =1017.19, p = .001) and GAD symptoms (F (3,1041) = 5.113, p = .002) than older generations. CONCLUSIONS: Gender and generation appeared to be the most consistent risk factor for higher levels of generalized anxiety and PTSD symptoms in the current pandemic. Other variables C such as information seeking behaviours, parental and marriage status, chronic conditions C yielded less consistent evidence.

Potential long-term side effects of the vessel wall trauma caused by mechanical irritation of the endothelium are unknown up to now. METHODS From a retrospectively established database of 640 acute stroke treatments, we selected 261 patients with 265 embolic vessel occlusions treated successfully by mTE without permanent implantation of a stent. Analysis comprised the type of devices used and the number of passes performed. Digital subtraction angiography immediately after treatment was evaluated for vasospasm, dissection, and extravasation. Control angiographic images were evaluated for any morphological change compared to the immediate posttreatment angiographic run. RESULTS Recanalization was achieved with a median of one (range 1-10) mTE maneuvers. Vasospasm occurred in 69 territories (26.0 %) and was treated with glyceroltrinitrate in three. Dissection was observed in one vessel (0.4 %). Intraprocedural hemorrhage in two patients (0.8 %) was either wire or device induced. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography was available for 117 territories after a median of 107 days, revealing target vessel occlusion in one segment (0.9 %) and a de novo stenosis of four segments (3.4 %). All findings were clinically asymptomatic. Posttreatment vasospasm was more frequent in patients with de novo stenosis and occlusion (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION De novo stenoses and occlusions occur in a small proportion of patients after mTE. Because all lesions were clinically asymptomatic, this finding does not affect the overall benefit of the treatment.

This study screened natural compounds in vitro to identify inhibitors against Nsp15 from SARS-CoV-2. Three natural compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), baicalin, and quercetin, were identified as potential inhibitors. Potent antiviral activity of EGCG was confirmed in plaque reduction neutralization tests with a SARS-CoV-2 strain (PRNT50 = 0.20 M).

Cytokines cause inflammation which have been induced the injuries in lung lining.Some observational studies confirmed that Ginkgo Biloba reduced the risk of asthma, sepsis and another respiratory disease as well as it reduced the risk of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms. While other evidences suggested the characters of Ginkgo Biloba as an antivirus agent through several mechanisms. Ginkgolic acid (GA) can inhibit the fusion and synthesis of viral proteins, thus, it inhibit the Herpes Simplex Virus type1 (HSV-1), genome replication in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and the infections of the Zika Virus (ZIKV). Also, it inhibits the wide spectrum of fusion by inhibiting the three types of proteins that have been induced fusion as (Influenza A Virus [IAV], Epstein Barr Virus [EBV], HIV and Ebola Virus [EBOV]).The secondary mechanism of GA targeting inhibition of the DNA and protein synthesis in virus, greatly have been related to its strong effects, even afterward the beginning of the infection, therefore, it potentially treats the acute viral contaminations like (Measles and Coronavirus COVID-19). Additionally, it has been used topically as an effective agent on vigorous lesions including (varicella-zoster virus [VZV], HSV-1 and HSV-2). Ginkgo Biloba may be useful for treating the infected people with coronavirus COVID-19 through its beneficial effect.

Congenital anomalies, the most common NCD affecting children, have recently become the fifth leading cause of under-five mortality worldwide, ahead of other conditions such as malaria, neonatal sepsis and malnutrition. Genetic counseling has been shown to be an effective method to decrease the impact of congenital anomalies and genetic conditions but is absent in almost all sub-Saharan Africa countries. To address this need for counseling services we designed and implemented the first broad-based genetic counseling curriculum in Ethiopia, launching it at St. Pauls Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: The curriculum, created by Michigan Medicine and SPHMMC specialists, consisted of medical knowledge and genetic counseling content and was delivered to two cohorts of nurses. Curriculum evaluation consisted of satisfaction surveys and pre- and post-assessments covering medical knowledge and genetic counseling content. Following Cohort 1 training, the curriculum was modified to increase the medical knowledge material and decrease Western genetic counseling principles material. RESULTS: Both cohorts reported high levels of satisfaction but felt the workshop was too short. No significant improvements in assessment scores were seen for Cohort 1 in terms of total scores and medical knowledge and genetic counseling-specific questions. Following curriculum modification, improvements were seen in Cohort 2 with an increase in total assessment scores from 63% to 73% (p = 0.043), with medical knowledge-specific questions increasing from 57% to 79% (p = 0.01) with no significant change in genetic counseling-specific scores. Multiple logistic, financial, cultural and systems-specific barriers were identified with recommendations for their consideration presented.

This study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the detection and management of colorectal cancer in England. METHODS: Data were extracted from four population-based datasets spanning NHS England (the National Cancer Cancer Waiting Time Monitoring, Monthly Diagnostic, Secondary Uses Service Admitted Patient Care and the National Radiotherapy datasets) for all referrals, colonoscopies, surgical procedures, and courses of rectal radiotherapy from Jan 1, 2019, to Oct 31, 2020, related to colorectal cancer in England. Differences in patterns of care were investigated between 2019 and 2020. Percentage reductions in monthly numbers and proportions were calculated. FINDINGS: As compared to the monthly average in 2019, in April, 2020, there was a 63% (95% CI 53C71) reduction (from 36 274 to 13 440) in the monthly number of 2-week referrals for suspected cancer and a 92% (95% CI 89C95) reduction in the number of colonoscopies (from 46 441 to 3484). Numbers had just recovered by October, 2020. This resulted in a 22% (95% CI 8C34) relative reduction in the number of cases referred for treatment (from a monthly average of 2781 in 2019 to 2158 referrals in April, 2020). By October, 2020, the monthly rate had returned to 2019 levels but did not exceed it, suggesting that, from April to October, 2020, over 3500 fewer people had been diagnosed and treated for colorectal cancer in England than would have been expected. There was also a 31% (95% CI 19C42) relative reduction in the numbers receiving surgery in April, 2020, and a lower proportion of laparoscopic and a greater proportion of stoma-forming procedures, relative to the monthly average in 2019. By October, 2020, laparoscopic surgery and stoma rates were similar to 2019 levels. For rectal cancer, there was a 44% (95% CI 17C76) relative increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in April, 2020, relative to the monthly average in 2019, due to greater use of short-course regimens. Although in June, 2020, there was a drop in the use of short-course regimens, rates remained above 2019 levels until October, 2020. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sustained reduction in the number of people referred, diagnosed, and treated for colorectal cancer. By October, 2020, achievement of care pathway targets had returned to 2019 levels, albeit with smaller volumes of patients and with modifications to usual practice. As pressure grows in the NHS due to the second wave of COVID-19, urgent action is needed to address the growing burden of undetected and untreated colorectal cancer in England.

DESIGN Analysis of recipient myocardial tissue and serum from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and controls undergoing cardiac transplantation for end-stage cardiac disease. SETTING University virology department and transplantation unit. METHODS Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequence analysis of myocardial RNA and DNA; enterovirus-specific in situ hybridization; enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M detection. RESULTS Enterovirus RNA was detected in myocardial tissue from only a small proportion of (five of 75) hearts. However, although enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M responses were detected in 22 (28%) of 39 controls patients, a significantly higher prevalence was observed among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (22 (56%) of 39 patients; P < 0.005). All enteroviruses detected in myocardium showed greatest nucleotide sequence homology with coxsackievirus type B3. Detection of enterovirus RNA in myocardium by the polymerase chain reaction and by in situ hybridisation gave comparable results. Other potentially cardiotropic virus genomes, including human cytomegalovirus, influenzaviruses, and coronaviruses were not detected in myocardium. CONCLUSION This study found that enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M responses provided the strongest evidence of enterovirus involvement in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the high background prevalence of these responses limits their diagnostic value. The finding that enteroviruses detected in myocardium were coxsackievirus type B3 accords with recent findings in patients with acute myocarditis, and indicates that this serotype is the major cardiotropic human enterovirus.","output":"Serological and molecular evidence of enterovirus infection in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Restrictions due to COVID-19 necessitated staying at home, but in some cases, encouraged charitable behavior, e.g., donating items to people in need (e.g., clothes, food), or money to support combatting COVID-19.

An electrospinning process was utilized to fabricate nanofibrous membrane and virus deactivation mechanisms discussed. The nanofiber mask material was characterized by SEM and airflow rate testing. SEM results indicated that the nanofibers from electrospinning are about 15-30 m in diameter with random porosity and orientation which have the potential to capture and kill the virus. Theoretical estimation signifies that an 85 L/min rate of airflow through the face mask is possible which ensures good breathability over an extensive range of pressure drops and pore sizes.

The aim of this observational study was to characterize the myocardial effects during SARS-CoV-2 infections by echocardiography. RESULTS AND METHODS: An extended echocardiographic image acquisition protocol was performed in 18 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection assessing LV longitudinal, radial, and circumferential deformation including rotation, twist, and untwisting. Furthermore, LV deformation was analyzed in an age-matched control group of healthy individuals (n = 20). The most prevalent finding was a reduced longitudinal strain observed predominantly in more than one basal LV segment (n = 10/14 patients, 71%). This pattern reminded of a \\"reverse tako-tsubo\\" morphology that is not typical for other viral myocarditis. Additional findings included a biphasic pattern with maximum post-systolic or negative regional radial strain predominantly basal (n = 5/14 patients, 36%); the absence or dispersion of basal LV rotation (n = 6/14 patients, 43%); a reduced or positive regional circumferential strain in more than one segment (n = 7/14 patients, 50%); a net rotation showing late post-systolic twist or biphasic pattern (n = 8/14 patients, 57%); a net rotation showing polyphasic pattern and/or higher maximum net values during diastole (n = 8/14 patients, 57%). CONCLUSION: Myocardial involvement due to SARS-CoV-2-infection was highly prevalent in the present cohort-even in patients with mild symptoms. It appears to be characterized by specific speckle tracking deformation abnormalities in the basal LV segments.

Mortality was similar between cell-based and control groups (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.05, 17.41). Cell-based treatments preserved ejection fraction by 6.9% (p < 0.01), while intramyocardial at a dose of 1-10 M cells/kg optimized ejection fraction. Clinical: single ventricle physiology was the most common cardiac disease (n = 9). Cardiac tissue was a frequent cell source, dosed from 3.0  105 to 2.4  107 cells/kg. A decrease in adverse events occurred in the cell-based cohort (OR 0.17, p < 0.01). Administration of cell-based therapies improved ejection fraction (MD 4.84; 95% CI 1.62, 8.07; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this meta-analysis, cell-based therapies were safe and improved specific measures of cardiac function. Implications from this review may provide methodologic recommendations (source, dose, route, timing) for future clinical trials. Of note, many of the results described in this study pattern those seen in adult stem cell reviews and meta-analyses.","output":"Safety and efficacy of cell therapies in pediatric heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Central management of electronic medical systems faces a major challenge because it requires trust in a single entity that cannot effectively protect files from unauthorized access or attacks. This challenge makes it difficult to provide some services in central electronic medical systems, such as file search and verification, although they are needed. This gap motivated us to develop a system based on blockchain that has several characteristics: decentralization, security, anonymity, immutability, and tamper-proof. The proposed system provides several services: storage, verification, and search. The system consists of a smart contract that connects to a decentralized user application through which users can transact with the system. In addition, the system uses an interplanetary file system (IPFS) and cloud computing to store patients data and files.

However, previous studies suggested that none of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs is the descendant of the direct ancestor of SCoV, based on their relatively distant phylogenetic relationship. In this study, evidence of the recombinant origin of the genome of a bat SLCoV is demonstrated. We identified a potential recombination breakpoint immediately after the consensus intergenic sequence between open reading frame 1 and the S coding region, suggesting the replication intermediates may participate in the recombination event, as previously speculated for other CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of its parental regions suggests the presence of an uncharacterized SLCoV lineage that is phylogenetically closer to SCoVs than any of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs. Using various Bayesian molecular-clock models, interspecies transfer of this SLCoV lineage from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civets) was estimated to have happened a median of 4.08 years before the SARS outbreak. Based on this relatively short window period, we speculate that this uncharacterized SLCoV lineage may contain the direct ancestor of SCoV. This study sheds light on the possible host bat species of the direct ancestor of SCoV, providing valuable information on the scope and focus of surveillance for the origin of SCoV.","output":"Evidence of the recombinant origin of a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus and its implications on the direct ancestor of SARS coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is among the major diseases threatening human health. Although the immune response plays an important role in tumor development, its exact mechanisms are unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we used CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithms to determine the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) as well as the number of immune and mesenchymal components from the data of 474 lung cancer patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. And we used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) for validation. RESULTS: We observed that immune, stromal, and assessment scores were only somewhat related to survival with no statistically significant differences. Further investigations revealed these scores to be associated with different pathology types. GO and KEGG analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed that they were strongly associated with immunity in lung cancer. In order to determine whether the signaling pathways identified by GO and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analyses were up- or down-regulated, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis using the entire matrix of differentially expressed genes. We found that signaling pathways involved in hallmark allograft rejection, hallmark apical junction, hallmark interferon gamma response, the hallmark P53 pathway, and the hallmark TNF- signaling via NF-??B were up-regulated in the high-ESTIMATE-score group. CIBERSORT analysis for the proportion of TICs revealed that different immune cells were positively correlated with the ESTIMATE score. Cox regression analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that CPA3, C15orf48, FCGR1B, and GNG4 were associated with patient prognosis. A prognostic model was constructed wherein patients with high-risk scores had a worse prognosis (p < 0.001 using the log-rank test). The Area Under Curve (AUC)value for the risk model in predicting the survival was 0.666. The validation set C index was 0.631 (95% CI: 0.580-0.652). The AUC for the risk formula in the validation set was 0.560 that confirmed predictivity of the signature. CONCLUSION: We found that immune-related gene expression models could predict patient prognosis.

METHODS: A scoping review of qualitative and quantitative studies was systematically undertaken by searching for English language publications in MEDLINE database and manual reference search of eligible articles. Thematic analysis was employed to identify and extract common concordance and discordance themes leading to the development of analytical constructs. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported on consumers (i.e. older patients aged 60 + years in their final years of life and/or their informal caregivers) and clinicians (doctors, nurses, social workers, etc.) perspectives on quality of medical, surgical or palliative/supportive care administered to older adults in the last year of life across all healthcare settings. RESULTS: Of the 2736 articles screened, 21 articles were included. Four themes identified concordance between consumers and clinicians perceptions of care quality: holistic patient care; coordinated care that facilitated EOL; the role of family at EOL; and impact of prognostic uncertainty on care planning. Three themes emerged for discordance of perceptions: understanding the patient needs at EOL; capacity of healthcare system/providers to accommodate family needs; and knowledge and communication of active or palliative care at EOL. CONCLUSIONS: While progress has been made on promoting patient autonomy and respecting the family role in representing patients best interest, gaps remain in terms of care coordination, communication of prognosis, public understanding of the meaning of goals of care including de-escalation of management and enactment of advance care directives by clinicians for people with diminished decision capacity. Public understanding of the meaning of comfort care and the need to prevent over-treatment are essential for their satisfaction with care and their ability to embrace the concept of a good death.

With this threat, the expectation of future outbreak, and the shortage of anti-viral drugs, scientists were challenged to develop novel antivirals. The objective of this study is to develop novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds with dual activity by targeting valuable less-mutated enzymes. Here, we have mapped the binding affinity of >500,000 compounds for potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), papain protease (PLpro) and human furin protease. The enzyme inhibition activity of most promising hits was screened and tested in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate incubated with Vero cells. Computational modelling and toxicity of the compounds were validated. The results revealed that 16 compounds showed potential binding activity against Mpro, two of them showed binding affinity against PLpro and furin protease. Respectively, compounds 7 and 13 showed inhibition activity against Mpro at IC50 0.45 and 0.11 M, against PLpro at IC50 0.085 and 0.063 M, and against furin protease at IC50 0.29 M. Computational modelling validated the binding affinity against all proteases. Compounds 7 and 13 showed significant inhibition activity against the virus at IC50 0.77 and 0.11 M, respectively. Both compounds showed no toxicity on mammalian cells. The data obtained indicated that compounds 7 and 13 exhibited potent dual inhibition activity against SARS-CoV-2. The dual activity of both compounds can be of great promise not only during the current pandemic but also for future outbreaks since the compounds' targets are of limited mutation and critical importance to the viral infection.","output":"Promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs by effective dual targeting against the viral and host proteases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: In 2016, Georgia implemented the Rural Hospital Tax Credit Program, which allows taxpayers to receive a tax credit for contributions to qualifying rural hospitals in the state.

SETTING: A single tertiary-care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Our study cohort included patients &#8805;18 years of age who had semiurgent or urgent hospital procedures or surgeries. METHODS: Overall, 625 patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using a combination of phone questionnaire (7 days prior to the anticipated procedure), RT-PCR and chest computed tomography (CT) between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 625 patients, 520 scans (83.2%) were interpreted as normal; 1 (0.16%) had typical features of COVID-19; 18 scans (2.88%) had indeterminate features of COVID-19; and 86 (13.76%) had atypical features of COVID-19. In total, 640 RT-PCRs were performed, with 1 positive result (0.15%) in a patient with a CT scan that yielded an atypical finding. Of the 18 patients with chest CTs categorized as indeterminate, 5 underwent repeat negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab 1 week after their initial swab. Also, 1 patient with a chest CT categorized as typical had a follow-up repeat negative RT-PCR, indicating that the chest CT was likely a false positive. After surgery, none of the patients developed signs or symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 that would indicate the need for a repeated RT-PCR or CT scan.

To date, no research appears to have been conducted on this matter. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of obtaining IC from patients among health care providers (HCP) in the DRC. Methods This was a cross-sectional study, with a convenient sampling of 422 participants. Data from the questions were collected on an imported Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for review at INSTAT.TM The authors set IC's accurate knowledge and practice at 80% or higher. The Fisher Exact test was used to compare categorical association results, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Results showed that giving information in detail to patients on their medical condition was associated with formal training on medical ethics and IC (p: 0.0028; OR: 1.894; CI: 1.246 to 2.881), which was also associated with answering the patient's questions in detail (p: 0.0035; OR: 1.852; CI: 1.236 to 2.774). About 127(30.09 %) of participants scored 80% or higher. Extracurricular training was associated with withholding information from patients, up to 27 times more than other factors (p< 0.0001; OR: 27.042; CI: 13.628 to 53.657). when it comes to get IC, HCP with many years of practice scored better than others, in one of the question the odd ratio was closer to 7 (p< 0.0001; OR: 6.713; CI: 4.352 to 10.356). Only 47(11.14%) of the participants scored 80% or more of the questions about practice of IC. Conclusion For a variety of reasons, knowledge and practice of IC among HCPs was very low.

This paper shows how accuracy and utility of testing programs depend not just on the type of tests, but on the context as well. METHODS: We describe the testing methods that have been developed and the possible testing strategies; then, we focus on two possible methods of population-wide testing, i.e., pooled testing and testing with rapid antigen tests. We show the accuracy of split-pooling method and how, in different pre-test probability scenarios, the positive and negative predictive values vary using rapid antigen tests. RESULTS: Split-pooling, followed by retesting of negative results, shows a higher sensitivity than individual testing and requires fewer tests. In case of low pre-test probability, a negative result with antigen test could allow to rule out the infection, while, in case of a positive result, a confirmatory molecular test would be necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Test performance alone is not enough to properly choose which test to use; goals and context of the testing program are essential.

We showed that application of the statins in the concentration range from 1.5 M to 50 M inhibited the channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was the most potent in case of simvastatin and the least potent in case of pravastatin. The inhibition was partially irreversible in case of simvastatin and fully reversible in case of pravastatin and mevastatin. It was accompanied by a significant acceleration of the current inactivation rate without any significant change of the activation rate.

However, the knowledge of which diseases are more affected by SEP and whose outcomes could be improved by having a more equitable society remains uncertain on a population basis. METHODS: We measured socioeconomic and gender inequalities in the pre-COVID-19 era for 29 diseases in the entire childhood population in Catalonia to identify which diseases are most impacted by inequalities. This population-based study included 1,449,816 children under 15 years old from 2014 to 2017 (48.52% girls) and each of their registered diagnoses within the Catalonia National Health System. We calculated frequency measures by SEP and their sex ratios for each disease. We estimated four regression-based inequality measures: slope index of inequality, relative index of inequality (RII), absolute population-attributable fraction, and population-attributable fraction. RESULTS: Twenty-five of the 29 diseases examined showed SEP inequalities. The diseases with the greatest inequalities in both sexes were tuberculosis, obesity, adjustment and anxiety disorders, essential hypertension, poisoning, short gestation, low birth weight, foetal growth retardation and intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia and trauma (RII  2.0); only food allergy showed the opposite pattern (RII < 1.0). Overall, 80,188 (7.80%) of the disease events in boys and 74,921 (8.88%) in girls would be avoided if all children had the same disease rate as those in the medium-high SEP group, with tuberculosis, intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia and trauma, obesity, and short gestation, low birth weight, foetal growth retardation being those that could be reduced the most in relative terms, and dermatitis, injuries, acute bronquitis, and being overweight those that could be reduced the most in absolute terms. Girls present higher RII than boys for respiratory allergy, asthma, dermatitis, being overweight, and obesity (p < 0.05). In contrast, boys showed higher RII compared to girls only in congenital anomalies (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic and gender inequalities are widely present in childhood health. This indicates that SEP plays a common role in their development although it varies in magnitude according to each disease. It is also a phenomenon that comprises all SEP groups in society.

CoVs encode a proofreading 3-to-5 exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion.

A cross-sectional online survey measured variables including food insecurity prevalence, self-reported food waste, food management behaviours, confidence and frequency of use of a range of cooking methods, type of food eaten (ultra-processed, semi-finished, unprocessed) and packaging type foods are purchased in. Findings 39% of participants have experienced some food insecurity in the last 12 months. Being younger, having a greater BMI and living in a smaller household were associated with food insecurity. Green leaves, carrots, potatoes and sliced bread are the most wasted of purchased foods. Polenta, green leaves and white rice are the most wasted cooked foods. Food secure participants reported wasting a smaller percentage of purchased and cooked foods compared to food insecure participants. Overall, participants were most confident about boiling, microwaving and stir-frying and least confident with using a pressure cooker or sous vide. Food secure participants were more confident with boiling, stir-frying, grilling and roasting than insecure food participants. Practical implications This has implications for post lockdown policy, including food policies and guidance for public-facing communications.

EBV replicates in the stratified epithelium but the nasopharynx is also composed of pseudostratified epithelium with distinct cell types. Latent infection is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we show with nasopharyngeal conditionally reprogrammed cells cultured at the air-liquid interface that pseudostratified epithelial cells are susceptible to EBV infection. Donors varied in susceptibility to de novo EBV infection, but susceptible cultures also displayed differences with respect to pathogenesis. The cultures from one donor yielded lytic infection but cells from two other donors were positive for EBV-encoded EBERs and negative for other lytic infection markers. All cultures stained positive for the pseudostratified markers CK7, MUC5AC, -tubulin in cilia, and the EBV epithelial cell receptor Ephrin receptor A2. To define EBV transcriptional programs by cell type and to elucidate latent/lytic infection-differential changes, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on one EBV-infected culture that resulted in alignment with many EBV transcripts. EBV transcripts represented a small portion of the total transcriptome (~0.17%). All cell types in the pseudostratified epithelium had detectable EBV transcripts with suprabasal cells showing the highest number of reads aligning to many EBV genes. Several restriction factors (IRF1, MX1, STAT1, C18orf25) known to limit lytic infection were expressed at lower levels in the lytic subcluster. A third of the differentially-expressed genes in NPC tumors compared to an uninfected pseudostratified ALI culture overlapped with the differentially-expressed genes in the latent subcluster. A third of these commonly perturbed genes were specific to EBV infection and changed in the same direction. Collectively, these findings suggest that the pseudostratified epithelium could harbor EBV infection and that the pseudostratified infection model mirrors many of the transcriptional changes imposed by EBV infection in NPC.","output":"A primary nasopharyngeal three-dimensional air-liquid interface cell culture model of the pseudostratified epithelium reveals differential donor- and cell type-specific susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Bundesliga was the first major sports league in the world to restart from the corona shutdown on May 17, 2020 This is associated with a number of economically relevant effects The public discussed above all the question of whether football could be given special treatment, because football millionaires went back to work, while other areas of society that are more relevant to the system, such as schools and daycare centers, remained closed The question of whether football could use scarce test capacities to implement its hygiene concept was also discussed intensively among football fans Conversely, football is an important source of entertainment for many people, especially in monotonous everyday corona life Ultimately, the great interest of many people is the reason why the player salaries in football are so high","output":"Bundesliga geht weltweit voran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health is an important part of human life.

The disease continues to pose a major therapeutic challenge. Patient mortality is ultimately caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome (or cytokine storm ) is likely to be a contributing factor to ARDS in many patients. Because interleukin 6 (IL-6) is known to play a key role in inflammation, IL-6 receptor inhibitors such as tocilizumab may potentially treat COVID-19 by attenuating cytokine release. We present the case of a 48-year-old male with severe COVID-19, on the verge of meeting intubation requirements, who needed progressive oxygen support for respiratory distress. The patient was treated with a non-weight-based dosage of tocilizumab to prevent the onset of a cytokine storm. We chose to administer an IL-6 inhibitor because of the gradually increasing levels of acute phase reactants identified on serial blood draws, as well as his declining respiratory status. The treatment was well-tolerated in conjunction with standard drug therapies for COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc). The patient subsequently experiencedmarked improvements in his respiratory symptoms and overall clinical status over the following days. We believe that tocilizumab played a substantial role in his ability to avert clinical decline, particularly the need for mechanical ventilation. Ultimately, the patient was downgraded from the ICU and discharged within days. We highlight the potential of IL-6 inhibitors to prevent the progression of respiratory disease to a point requiring ventilator support. This case underscores the potential importance of early serial measurements of IL-6 and cytokine storm-associated acute phase reactants, such as ferritin, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, in guiding clinical decision-making in the management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Conclusion: The early, proactive identification of serumacute phase reactants should be implemented in the treatment of COVID-19 in order to screen for a primary contributor tomortality the cytokine storm. This screening, when followed by aggressive early treatment for cytokine storm, may have optimal therapeutic benefits and obviate the need for mechanical ventilation, thereby decreasing mortality. Additionally, we reviewcurrent evidence regarding cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 and the use of IL-6 receptor inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, and examine other reported cases in the literature describing IL-6 antagonist treatment for patients with COVID-19.","output":"Treatment of severe COVID-19 with tocilizumab mitigates cytokine storm and averts mechanical ventilation during acute respiratory distress: A case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess whether the use of an aerosol box for percutaneous tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 can protect healthcare workers and affect the procedure-related outcomes and complications.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study using information of all hospital discharges of the Spanish National Health System. All episodes with a discharge diagnosis of AM from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2015 were included. The risk-standardized in-hospital mortality ratio (RSMR) was calculated using a multilevel risk adjustment model developed by the Medicare and Medicaid Services. Temporal trends for in-hospital mortality were modelled using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 11,147 episodes of AM were analysed, most of them idiopathic (94.7%). The rate of AM discharges increased along the period, from 13 to 30/million inhabitants/year (2003 to 2015), and this increase was statistically significant when weighted by age and sex (incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.06,95%CI 1.04-1.08,p=0.001). In-hospital crude mortality rate was 3.1%, diminishing significantly along 2003 to 2015 (IRR 0.95,95%CI 0.92-0.99,p=0.02). RSMR also significantly diminished along the period (IRR 0.95,95%CI 0.92-0.99,p=0.01).

In addition, we determined the serial interval to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)), the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case. RESULTS: In the 181 households analyzed, we found 212 RSV-ARI in 152 households with a single case and 29 households with multiple cases, which included 29 1st RSV-ARI and 31 2nd RSV-ARI. We also found possible index cases among children <5 years old in the same household for 29.0% (18 of 62) of young infants with RSV-ARI. The estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days, and R(0) was estimated to be 0.92C1.33 for RSV-A and 1.04C1.76 for RSV-B, which varied between different times (2014 and 2015) and places. CONCLUSIONS: Young infants are likely to acquire RSV infection from older children in the same household. Therefore, vaccination targeting older children might protect infants from RSV infection.","output":"Transmission of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Among Children Under 5 Years in Households of Rural Communities, the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transforming a traditional industry by adopting autonomous solutions is complex, generating paradoxical tensions on multiple aggregate levels.

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, can involve sequelae and other medical complications that last weeks to months after initial recovery, which has come to be called Long-COVID or COVID long-haulers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing long-term effects of COVID-19 and estimates the prevalence of each symptom, sign, or laboratory parameter of patients at a post-COVID-19 stage. Methods . LitCOVID (PubMed and Medline) and Embase were searched by two independent researchers. All articles with original data for detecting long-term COVID-19 published before 1 (st) of January 2021 and with a minimum of 100 patients were included. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using I (2) statistics. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, although the study protocol was not registered. Results. A total of 18,251 publications were identified, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of 55 long-term effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included. The follow-up time ranged from 14 to 110 days post-viral infection. The age of the study participants ranged between 17 and 87 years. It was estimated that 80% (95% CI 65-92) of the patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%). All meta-analyses showed medium (n=2) to high heterogeneity (n=13). Conclusions . In order to have a better understanding, future studies need to stratify by sex, age, previous comorbidities, the severity of COVID-19 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe), and duration of each symptom. From the clinical perspective, multi-disciplinary teams are crucial to developing preventive measures, rehabilitation techniques, and clinical management strategies with whole-patient perspectives designed to address long COVID-19 care.","output":"More Than 50 Long-Term Effects of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a model for the transmission of perturbations across the amino acids of a protein represented as an interaction network.

Mass fractions of metals, including Ag, Cd, and Pb, and of one metalloid, Sb, higher than their crustal abundance, were observed within the entire Weser Basin. Isotope-amount ratio n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) and ?Nd ranged from 0.71182  0.00005 to 0.72880  0.00009 and -11.3  0.3 to -21.0  0.3, respectively. n(206Pb)/n(204Pb), n(207Pb)/n(204Pb), and n(208Pb)/n(204Pb) ranged from 18.226  0.008 to 18.703  0.012, 15.613  0.007 to 15.653  0.012 and 38.14  0.02 to 38.84  0.02, respectively. Sr and Nd isotope compositions reflected primarily a mixture of natural materials derived from the Weser Basin. Pb isotope signatures indicated strong anthropogenic influences in the middle-lower Weser region. Pb isotopic compositions in the sediments from the Aller (tributary of the Weser) and its tributary suggested influence from historical Pb-Zn ore mining in the Harz Mountains that might contribute to the observed elevated mass fractions of Ag, Cd, Sb and Pb in that region. K-means cluster and principal component analysis of the Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope data yielded results consistent with their isotope systematics, supporting statistical analysis as an unsupervised tool in isotope fingerprinting studies. Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic signatures in the sediments of the Weser were distinctively different from those of another major river discharging into the North Sea, the Elbe.

As there have been no prior studies on the acceptance of telemedicine by pregnant women, we conducted this survey to investigate the same. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous questionnaire survey of pregnant women who underwent telemedicine check-ups from March 4 to June 30, 2020, using a mobile fetal heart rate monitor and video call system through the Hokkaido University Hospital. RESULTS: Out of the 77 individuals who received prenatal telemedicine check-ups, 54 individuals (70%) had complications, and 64 individuals (83%) consented for the questionnaire survey. In the video call system, 18 individuals (28%) were found to be unwell and 17 individuals (27%) experienced difficulty using the mobile fetal heart rate monitoring device. Assuming scores for face-to-face consultations were five out of 10, the mean score for satisfaction was 4.2, but 19 (30%) women felt equal or greater satisfaction with face-to-face consultations. If not for the threat of COVID-19, only four individuals (6%) proactively expressed a desire for telemedicine, with a significantly less demand observed among primiparous women than multiparous women. The permissible additional financial burden enabling telemedicine was $10 or less for 80% of subjects. CONCLUSION: In this small preliminary study, 30% of the pregnant women felt equal or greater satisfaction with telemedicine than face-to-face consultations. A stronger demand for telemedicine was exhibited by multiparous women than primiparous women.

Initial data, collected a few months into the pandemic, showed that families, particularly those experiencing food insecurity, reported detrimental changes to their home food environment and parent feeding practices, compared to before COVID-19. Objective: This follow-up study obtained longitudinal data from a sample of parents in the United States to quantify changes in food security status, the home food environment, and parent feeding practices, from before to across COVID-19 as the pandemic continued to persist. Methods: Parents (N = 433) completed online surveys May (T1) and September (T2) 2020 during COVID-19. Food security, home food environment, and parent feeding practices were reported at each timepoint. At T1, parents also retrospectively reported on these factors pertaining to before COVID-19. Chi square analyses and repeated measure mixed models examined associations among study variables. Results: Low or very low food security increased from before COVID-19 (37%) to T1 (54%) and decreased by T2 (45%). About 30% of families who became food insecure, and 44% who stayed food insecure from T1 to T2, reported a decrease in total food in their home; only 3%-6% who became/stayed food secure reported this decrease. Parents' concern for child overweight and use of monitoring increased from before COVID-19 to T1, and decreased by T2, but remained elevated above pre-COVID-19 values.

We evaluated the feasibility of using SARS-CoV-2 peptide Kode Technology-modified red cells (C19-kodecytes) to develop an assay compatible with existing routine serologic platforms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A panel of eight unique red cells modified using Kode Technology function-spacer-lipid constructs and bearing short SARS-CoV-2 peptides was developed (C19-kodecyte assay). Kodecytes were tested against undiluted expected antibody-negative and -positive plasma samples in manual tube and three column agglutination technology (CAT) platforms. Parallel analysis with the same peptides in solid phase by enzyme immunoassays was performed. Evaluation samples included >120 expected negative blood donor samples and >140 COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples, with independent serologic analysis from two centers. RESULTS: Specificity (negative reaction rate against expected negative samples) in three different CAT platforms against novel C19-kodecytes was >91%, which correlated with published literature. Sensitivity (positive reaction rate against expected positive convalescent, PCR-confirmed samples) ranged from 82% to 97% compared to 77% with the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay.

Because of this, responsible management education and learning (RMEL) must integrate poverty as a threshold concept on which students' cognitive frame is built. Design/methodology/approach This paper advocates for poverty to be taught as a multidimensional threshold concept that encompasses a person's freedoms and capabilities, in addition to their income (Sen, 1999). Further, this paper provides a framework for integration into all curricula grounded in RMEL's unique domain of inquiry and study: the integration of ethics, responsibility and sustainability. Findings Threshold concepts transform student learning in durable, immutable ways. When poverty is taught as such, students develop more elaborate poverty cognitive frames that they can apply across their entire course of study. This paper describes how to: (1) reframe poverty as a threshold concept;(2) apply Biggs' (2003) framework of constructive alignment to assure the integrity of course learning objectives and the curriculum;(3) create poverty-related assignments that are emotionally engaging and relevant for students (Dart, 2008);and (4) use this proposed framework of including poverty in business classes. Research limitations/implications Without an integrated multidimensional understanding of poverty, students will not emerge as managers competent in addressing these critical issues from within a business context (Grimm,2020). It will be imperative in future research to evaluate the outcomes of doing so and to determine whether this solution creates responsible managers more competent in addressing poverty-rooted issues. Originality/value This paper brings together two elements of student learning central to understanding poverty: threshold concepts and cognitive frames.

METHODS: We collected 16 233 SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples from June 8 through July 10, 2020, from a convenience sample of Illinois- and Wisconsin-based adult health care workers. The research team, in collaboration with ACL Laboratories, used a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Study data included SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay results and demographic characteristics of workers (age, sex, race, ethnicity, clinical role, zip code). We generated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to describe disparities in seroprevalence distribution among demographic and social factors. RESULTS: Of 16 233 IgG serum samples tested, 622 (3.8%) test results were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found significant disparities in SARS-CoV-2 positivity by age, race, ethnicity, and clinical role. Participants aged 32-82 had lower adjusted ORs (aORs) of positive IgG than participants aged 18-31 (aOR range, 0.54-0.66).

Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of assembly and, especially, disassembly of AP180/clathrin-containing cages. Here, we identified AP180 as a novel phosphatidic acid (PA)-binding protein from the mouse brain. Intriguingly, liposome binding assays using various phospholipids and PA species revealed that AP180 most strongly bound to 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-PA (18:0/22:6-PA) to a comparable extent as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)), which is known to associate with AP180. An AP180 N-terminal homology domain (1C289 aa) interacted with 18:0/22:6-PA, and a lysine-rich motif (K38CK39CK40) was essential for binding. The 18:0/22:6-PA in liposomes in 100 nm diameter showed strong AP180-binding activity at neutral pH. Notably, 18:0/22:6-PA significantly attenuated the interaction of AP180 with clathrin.

Enjuanes, Virology 217: 495-507, 1996), and a cDNA with the information to encode DI-C RNA was cloned under the control of the T7 promoter. The molecularly cloned DI-C RNA was replicated in trans upon transfection of helper virus-infected cells and inhibited 20-fold the replication of the parental genome. A collection of 14 DI-C RNA deletion mutants (TGEV minigenomes) was synthetically generated and tested for their ability to be replicated and packaged. The smallest minigenome (M33) that was replicated by the helper virus and efficiently packaged was 3.3 kb. A minigenome of 2.1 kb (M21) was also replicated, but it was packaged with much lower efficiency than the M33 minigenome, suggesting that it had lost either the sequences containing the main packaging signal or the required secondary structure in the packaging signal due to alteration of the flanking sequences. The low packaging efficiency of the M21 minigenome was not due to minimum size restrictions. The sequences essential for minigenome replication by the helper virus were reduced to 1,348 nt and 492 nt at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. The TGEV-derived RNA minigenomes were successfully expressed following a two-step amplification system that couples pol II-driven transcription in the nucleus to replication supported by helper virus in the cytoplasm, without any obvious splicing. This system and the use of the reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS) allowed minigenome detection at passage zero, making it possible to distinguish replication efficiency from packaging capability.

DESIGN: We analyzed a 10-year cohort of adult acute neurologic injury patients (stroke and traumatic brain injury) without preexisting mild cognitive impairment or dementia, utilizing administrative databases. Patients were followed for in-hospital delirium and mild cognitive impairment or dementia. We report incidence and adjusted hazard ratios for mild cognitive impairment or dementia associated with delirium. Subgroups analyzed include acute neurologic injury categories, dementia subtypes, repeated delirium exposure, and age strata. SETTING: We used state emergency department and state inpatient databases for New York, Florida, and California. All visits are included in the databases regardless of payer status. PATIENTS: We included adult patients with diagnosis of stroke and traumatic brain injury as acute neurologic injury. Patients with preexisting mild cognitive impairment or dementia were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 911,380 acute neurologic injury patients, 5.2% were diagnosed with delirium. Mild cognitive impairment or dementia incidence among delirium patients was approximately twice that of nondelirium patients. In adjusted models, risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia was higher among patients with delirium (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.58).

METHODS: In the setting of the STROKOVID study including patients with acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to the ten hub hospitals in Lombardy, Italy, between March 8 and April 30, 2020, we compared clinical features of patients with confirmed infection and non-infected patients by logistic regression models and survival analysis. Then, we trained and tested a random forest (RF) binary classifier for the prediction of in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 1013 patients, 160 (15.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06-2.27) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.05-2.43) were independently associated with COVID-19 status. Patients with COVID-19 had increased stroke severity at admission [median NIHSS score, 9 (25th to75th percentile, 13) vs 6 (25th to75th percentile, 9)] and increased risk of in-hospital death (38.1% deaths vs 7.2%; HR 3.30; 95% CI 2.17-5.02).

METHODS: In a cross-sectional sample of 2423 Finnish physicians, dominance analysis was used to estimate the proportionate contribution of psychosocial factors to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. The psychosocial factors included job demands (time pressure, patient-related stress, lack of support, stress related to information systems, workCfamily conflict) and job resources (job control, team climate, organizational justice). RESULTS: Together, psychosocial factors explained 50% of the variance in emotional exhaustion, 24% in depersonalization and 11% in reduced professional efficacy. Time pressure was the most important predictor of emotional exhaustion (change in total variance explained R(2) = 45%), and patient-related stress was the most important predictor of both depersonalization (R(2) = 52%) and reduced professional accomplishment (R(2) = 23%).

Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationships between behavioral problems, bodyweight gain, and screen time. RESULTS: It was found that 50.3% of children exhibited some behavioral problems during school closure; fewer children exhibited such problems after schools reopened. Moreover, childrens behavioral problems during school closure were associated with longer total screen time (odds ratio [OR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14C1.28, p < .001).

All eight individuals completed the project with no physical injuries or problems with diabetes control. The blood glucose levels ranged from less than 3 mmol/l to 7 mmol/l in those without T1D, and less than 3 mmol/l to 9 mmol/l in those with T1D. The continuous glucose traces in those with T1D showed little variability in glucose levels. The participants without T1D had no symptoms from blood glucose under 3 mmol/l. Ketone levels ranged from 0.3 to 7.5 and the ketones for those with T1D were no different to ketones in those without T1D. The respiratory quotient was overwhelmingly in the fat-burning range. There was very little subjective hunger, nor did it negatively affect mood. In keto-adapted individuals, with or without T1DM, prolonged exercise for 5 days while in nutritional ketosis was feasible, and well tolerated. RECENT FINDINGS Eight adults, ages 28-62 years, trained for and completed a 5-day zero calorie fast covering 100 miles over 5 days. Training involved each individual preparing for the event according to their own programme. Typically, it involved both cardiovascular and strength training with the addition of practice water only fasts over 24-72 h or more based upon the individual's assessment of what was needed to complete the event. There was no formal protocol provided for this. The recommendation was that the participants would be keto adapted and trained to a level sufficient to complete the 5-day event. Keto adaptation was measured by ketone blood testing of betahydroxybutyrate. Two people had type 1 diabetes. All but one person was keto-adapted ahead of the event. All eight individuals completed the project with no physical injuries or problems with diabetes control. Prolonged fasting did neither lead to hunger nor did it negatively affect mood, which, if anything, was enhanced in most individuals. All keto-adapted people were shown to be burning fat stores throughout the 5 days, and everyone was measured to be in a state of nutritional ketosis. In type 1 diabetes, and ketones were in the same range as those without diabetes, insulin volumes were considerably reduced, and glucose control was close to physiological: nutritional ketosis is not a risk factor for diabetic ketoacidosis; consumption of sugar for energy is not required for distances of up to 100 miles in keto-adapted people; people who inject insulin do not necessarily need to consume carbohydrates unless rescuing a hypoglycaemic attack.

It discusses various characteristics of the families of viruses. Viruses are defined by the sum of the distinctive traits of the virion. These distinctive traits are as follows: (1) presence of a single nucleic acid; (2) incapacity to grow and to divide; (3) reproduction from the genetic material only; (4) absence of enzymes for energy metabolism; (5) absence of ribosomes; (6) absence of information for the production of enzymes in the energy cycle; (7) absence of information for the synthesis of the ribosomal proteins; and (8) absence of information for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. The viral infectious particle presents a great diversity in composition and structure. Order could be achieved only through a classification, which is a system of order. The goal of biological classification is to group together organisms presenting certain analogies and certain affinities and, if possible, to also bring out phylogenic relationships. The conceptions relative to the methodology of taxonomy, which is the science of classification, are diverse. A virus may have evolved from a given sector of DNA within the host cell. It could also very well have derived from the corresponding RNA messenger that contains the same information, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Therefore, theoretically, different viruses could have originated from nucleic acids of different but complementary nature. The nucleic acid of viruses is either single- or double-stranded. Viruses, as is generally accepted, derive from the nucleic acid of their host. Thus, RNA viruses could possibly have their origin in the RNA messenger.","output":"Remarks on the Classification of Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Understanding mid-term kinetics of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is the cornerstone for public health control of the pandemic and vaccine development. However, current evidence is rather based on limited measurements, losing sight of the temporal pattern of these changes. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis on a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients followed up for more than 6 months. Neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. IgG antibody titer was evaluated by ELISA against the S2 subunit, the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP). Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects models. Findings We found that individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection experienced an insignificant decay in neutralizing activity, which persisted six months after symptom onset or diagnosis. Hospitalized individuals showed higher neutralizing titers, which decreased following a two-phase pattern, with an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed after day 80. Despite this initial decay, neutralizing activity at six months remained higher among hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic. The slow decline in neutralizing activity at mid-term contrasted with the steep slope of anti-RBD, S2 or NP antibody titers, all of them showing a constant decline over the follow-up period. Conclusions Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the quality of the neutralizing immune response against SARS-CoV-2 evolves over the post-convalescent stage.

The pandemic has provided an opportunity to explore the links between moral distress, moral resilience, and emergence of mental health symptoms in HCWs.Methods: A total of 962 Canadian healthcare workers (884% female, 446 + 128 years old) completed an online survey during the first COVID-19 wave in Canada (between April 3 rd and September 3 rd , 2020). Respondents completed a series of validated scales assessing moral distress, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, and moral resilience. Respondents were grouped based on exposure to patients who tested positive for COVID-19. In addition to descriptive statistics and analyses of covariance, multiple linear regressions were used to evaluate association between moral resilience, demographic/professional factors and moral distress and to identify factors associated with moral resilience.Findings: Respondents working with patients with COVID-19 showed significantly more severe moral distress, anxiety and depression symptoms (F > 55, p < 020), and a higher proportion screened positive for mental disorders (Chi-squared > 91, p = 002), compared to healthcare workers who were not. Higher exposure to potentially morally injurious events (B=298, 95% CI [290, 305]) and lower moral resilience (B=312, 95% CI [004, 620]) were associated with worse moral distress. Moral resilience moderated the relationship between exposure to potentially morally injurious events and moral distress (p<001), and correlated with lower stress, anxiety and depression symptoms (r > 27, p<001).

MAS and associated cytokine storms have been observed in COVID-19 patients exhibiting systemic hyper-inflammation. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family, is elevated in both MAS and COVID-19 patients, and its level is known to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. IL-18 binds its specific receptor IL-1 Receptor 5 (IL-1R5, also known as IL-18 Receptor alpha chain), leading to the recruitment of the co-receptor, IL-1 Receptor 7 (IL-1R7, also known as IL-18 Receptor beta chain). This heterotrimeric complex then initiates downstream signaling, resulting in systemic and local inflammation. Here, we developed a novel humanized monoclonal anti-IL-1R7 antibody to specifically block the activity of IL-18 and its inflammatory signaling. We characterized the function of this antibody in human cell lines, in freshly obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and in human whole blood cultures. We found that the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly suppressed IL-18-mediated NF&#954;B activation, reduced IL-18-stimulated IFN?3 and IL-6 production in human cell lines, and reduced IL-18-induced IFN?3, IL-6 and TNF&#945; production in PBMCs. Moreover, the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly inhibited LPS- and Candida albicans-induced IFN?3 production in PBMCs, as well as LPS-induced IFN?3 production in whole blood cultures. Our data suggest that blocking IL-1R7 could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to specifically modulate IL-18 signaling, and may warrant further investigation into its clinical potential for treating IL-18-mediated diseases, including MAS and COVID-19.","output":"A novel anti-human IL-1R7 antibody reduces IL-18-mediated inflammatory signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In France, the epidemic phase of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in February 2020 and resulted in the implementation of emergency measures and a degradation in the organization of neuromuscular reference centers. In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website.

AIM: We aimed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in teachers and preschool educators and at identifying factors associated with infection. METHODS: We analysed cross-sectional data derived from 17,448 voluntary, PCR-based screening tests of asymptomatic educational staff in Berlin, Germany, between June and December 2020 using descriptive statistics and a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Participants were largely female (73.0%), and median age was 41 years (range: 18-78). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection proportion was 1.2% (95% CI: 1.0C1.4). Proportion of positive tests in educational staff largely followed community incidence until the start of the second pandemic wave, when an unsteady plateau was reached. Then, the proportion of positive tests in a (concurrent) population survey was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.6C1.4), 1.2% (95% CI: 0.8C1.8) in teachers and 2.6% (95% CI: 1.6C4.0) in preschool educators. Compared with teachers, increased odds of infection were conferred by being a preschool educator (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3C2.0) and by contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual outside of work (aOR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.5C5.5).

These features are reminiscent of several adverse reactions triggered by angiotensin II, and opposed by angiotensin1-7, in many experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors and entries into the cell through the fusion of its membrane with that of the cell. Hence, it down-regulates these receptors. The loss of ACE2 receptor activity from the external site of the membrane will lead to less angiotensin II inactivation and less generation of antiotensin1-7. In various experimental models of lung injury, the imbalance between angiotensin II over-activity and of antiotensin1-7 deficiency triggered inflammation, thrombosis and other adverse reactions. In COVID-19, such imbalance could play an important role in influencing the clinical picture and outcome of the disease.

Because the trigger for many bronchiolar disorders is environmental and humans live in a shared environment with similar susceptibility, understanding these diseases in pet cats has relevance to One Health.

This article formulates a robust nonlinear mixed-effects model based in the class of scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions for modeling COVID-19 deaths, which allows the analysts to model such data in the presence of the above described features simultaneously. An efficient EM-type algorithm is proposed to carry out maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. The bootstrap method is used to determine inherent characteristics of the nonlinear individual profiles such as confidence interval of the predicted deaths and fitted curves. The target is to model COVID-19 deaths curves from some Latin American countries since this region is the new epicenter of the disease. Moreover, since a mixed-effect framework borrows information from the population-average effects, in our analysis we include some countries from Europe and North America that are in a more advanced stage of their COVID-19 deaths curve.","output":"A robust nonlinear mixed-effects model for COVID-19 deaths data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Homeostatic control of neuronal excitability by modulation of synaptic inhibition (I) and excitation (E) of the principal neurons is important during brain maturation.

However, the feasibility of Lap-Hx for metastatic liver tumor of colorectal cancer also should be guaranteed oncologically. This study evaluated the short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx compared with open hepatectomy (Open-Hx) for patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) by matched-pair analysis. METHODS This study enrolled 21 patients who underwent Lap-Hx and compared them with 21 matched patients who underwent Open-Hx. The following parameters were matched between the two cohorts: tumor size, tumor location, and operative procedures. Both short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx were compared with those of Open-Hx. RESULTS No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of age, gender, tumor size, or operative procedures. With regard to short-term outcomes, the operative time for Lap-Hx (377  29 min) was similar to that for Open-Hx (369  31 min), whereas the blood loss for the patients who underwent a Lap-Hx (198  39 ml) was significantly less than for those who underwent an Open-Hx (326  50 ml). The incidence of postoperative complications among the patients who underwent Lap-Hx tended to be lower than for the patients who underwent Open-Hx, and intraabdominal abscess was observed only in the Open-Hx group. The hospital stay for Lap-Hx (average, 18.3 days) tended to be shorter than for Open-Hx (27 days). With respect to long-term outcomes, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates. CONCLUSIONS Lap-Hx is a safe and feasible option for selected patients with CLM.

The roles of congregate living and skilled nursing care needs is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of residential setting and level of skilled nursing care on COVID-19 outcomes for people receiving IDD services, compared to those not receiving IDD services. METHODS: Utilizing publicly available California data on COVID-19 outcomes for people receiving IDD services (early May through October 2, 2020), we determined outcomes based on seven types of residence, differentiated by number of residents and level of skilled nursing care provided. We compared these results to the larger California published outcomes. RESULTS: Compared to Californians not receiving IDD services, in general, those receiving IDD services had a 60% lower case rate, but 2.8 times higher case-fatality rate. COVID-19 outcomes varied significantly among Californians receiving IDD services by type of residence and skilled nursing care needs: higher rates of diagnosis in settings with larger number of residents, higher case-fatality and mortality rates in settings that provided 24-hour skilled nursing care. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis with COVID-19 among Californians receiving IDD services appears to be related to number of individuals within the residence, while adverse COVID-19 outcomes were associated with level of skilled nursing care. When data is available, future research should examine whether these relationships persist even when controlling for age and pre-existing conditions.","output":"COVID-19 Outcomes among People with Intellectual and Developmental Disability in California: The Importance of Type of Residence and Skilled Nursing Care Needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Animal studies have demonstrated the feasibility of tracheal replacement by silicone-stented allogenic aortas (AAs), showing mature cartilage regeneration into the grafts. In clinical trials, this graft did not prove stiff enough to allow long-term stent withdrawal. This graft insufficiency could be due to ischaemic phase prior to neoangiogenesis. To solve this issue, we investigated both the efficacy of the rabbit lateral thoracic fascial flap as a vehicle for revascularization of the AA and construction of a tube-shaped graft with transferable vascular pedicle, for more efficient replacement of the trachea. METHODS Thirty-four New Zealand rabbits were used. After harvesting of donors 'thoracic aortas', the fresh aortic allografts were transplanted within 1 h, and the others were cryopreserved. Fifteen male and four female rabbits were used as recipients for fresh (n = 9) or cryopreserved (n = 10) aortic allografts that were implanted under the skin of the chest wall, after graft wrap using a pedicled lateral thoracic fascial flap. Animal sacrifice was scheduled at regular intervals up to 61 days. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to study the morphology, revascularization process and viability of the construct. RESULTS There was no operative death. Animals showed no graft rejection, despite the absence of immunosuppressive therapy. They all had a satisfactory tubular morphology of their construct. Of the 19 rabbits, 15 were found to have a generally preserved histological structure of the aorta and satisfactory neoangiogenesis. In the last four, a severe wound complication was associated with necrosis of the aortic graft. FISH on three aortic grafts with satisfactory neoangiogenesis showed migration of recipient cells into the aortic graft, decreasing from the adventitial to the luminal side, associated with the persistence of cells from the donor. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that the chimeric construct transformed into a well-vascularized tube-shaped organ with transferable pedicle and some degree of stiffness. Persistence of donor's cells of normal morphology into the aortic graft was suggestive of minimal ischaemia during the initial phase of revascularization. This construct might be investigated in the setting of tracheal replacement in the rabbit model.","output":"Construction of a tube-shaped tracheal substitute using fascial flap-wrapped revascularized allogenic aorta."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In less than two decades, the world has experienced three outbreaks of deadly Coronaviruses, including the recent pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.

We previously confirmed that loss of ERAP1 functions resulted in exaggerated innate immune responses in a murine in vivo model. Here, we investigated the role of ERAP1 in suppressing inflammasome pathways and their dependence on ER stress responses. RESULTS: Using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), we found that loss of ERAP1 in macrophages resulted in exaggerated production of IL-1? and IL-18 and augmented caspase-1 activity, relative to wild type macrophages. Moreover, an in vivo colitis model utilizing dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) confirmed increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the colon of DSS treated ERAP1-/- mice as compared to identically stimulated WT mice. Interestingly, stimulated ERAP1-/- BMDMs and CD4+ T cells simultaneously demonstrated exaggerated ER stress, assessed by increased expression of ER stress-associated genes, a state that could be reverted to WT levels with use of the ER stress inhibitor Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results not only suggest that ERAP1 is important for regulating inflammasome dependent innate immune response pathways in vivo, but also propose a mechanism that underlies these changes, that may be associated with increased ER stress due to lack of normal ERAP1 functions.","output":"ERAP1 is a critical regulator of inflammasome-mediated proinflammatory and ER stress responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnancy is characterized by significant immunological changes and a cytokine profile, as well as vitamin deficiencies that can cause problems for the correct development of a fetus.

Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging, and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts. Objective: The aim of this study is to use Twitter data to explore methods to characterize and classify four COVID-19 conspiracy theories and to provide context for each of these conspiracy theories through the first 5 months of the pandemic. Methods: We began with a corpus of COVID-19 tweets (approximately 120 million) spanning late January to early May 2020. We first filtered tweets using regular expressions (n=1.8 million) and used random forest classification models to identify tweets related to four conspiracy theories. Our classified data sets were then used in downstream sentiment analysis and dynamic topic modeling to characterize the linguistic features of COVID-19 conspiracy theories as they evolve over time. Results: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores between 0.347 and 0.857);this performance increased as the given conspiracy theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. Conclusions: Although we focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become incorporated.","output":"Thought Id Share First and Other Conspiracy Theory Tweets from the COVID-19 Infodemic: Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the interaction of the cytosolic tail of Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV-CoV) M protein with Myosin Vb (MYO5B) (Figure 1A). MHV-CoV M interacts specifically with the alternative splice variant of cellular MYO5B including Exon D (MYO5B+D), that also mediates interaction with cellular Rab10. When co-expressed in human lung epithelial A549 and canine kidney epithelial MDCK cells, MYO5B+D co-localized with MHV-CoV M protein, as well as with M proteins from porcine epidemic diarrhea Virus (PEDV-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Figure 2). M-GFP chimeric proteins co-expressed with mCherry-MYO5B+D also co-localized with endogenous Rab10 and Rab11a (Figure 1B,C). We identified point mutations in MHV-CoV M that blocked the interaction with MYO5B+D in yeast 2-hybrid assays (Figure 1B). One of these point mutations (E121K) was previously shown to block MHV-CoV virion assembly, and it blocked interaction with MYO5B+D. The E to K mutation at homologous positions in PEDV-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 M proteins also blocked colocalization with MYO5B+D. Knockdown of Rab10 blocked the co-localization of the M proteins with MYO5B+D (Figure 2).

METHODS Cross-sectional survey administered to members of the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology (ASPO) from March to April 2020 using the Research Electronic Data Capture (Redcap), internet-based data capture platform. The brief, 10-item survey required 3 minutes to complete and used a 5-point Likert scale for primary questions. RESULTS Respondents included 172 fellowship trained, pediatric otolaryngologists with 14 median years of clinical practice and 25 median tympanostomy tube insertions per month (75% >40 per month). Although tubes, in any setting, were most often inserted in children under age 2 years (95% \\"often\\" or \\"very often\\") and in those aged 3 to 5 years (93%), the likelihoods of doing this in-office for these age groups were only 8% and 6% respectively. For children aged 6 to 12 years, likelihood of in-office insertion was only 15%. Frequent barriers noted were safety concerns, emotional trauma, physical pain, and inability to suction. Opportunities to facilitate this approach include improved topical anesthesia, availability of conscious sedation, conclusive research on adverse effects of general anesthesia, and availability of an automated tube insertion device. CONCLUSION Office-based insertion of tympanostomy tubes in children without general anesthesia is performed by a small minority of respondents, but there are discernible barriers and opportunities to promote future uptake.

In this issue, the protective effect of vitamin C against oxidative damage caused by copper exposure was studied in monocytes/macrophages (MO/MD) and IgM+ B cells of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), the cell types possessing phagocytic activities. The significant increase of ROS level and up-regulation of proinflammatory factors accompanied by depletion of GSH and down-regulation of antioxidative molecules in MO/MD and IgM+ B cells, when stressed with CuO NPs or Cu ions, indicated the induction of oxidative damage due to the toxicological effects with copper exposure. Copper induced cell apoptosis through mitochondrial-dependent pathway in these two cell populations was demonstrated with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (m) and activation of apoptosis factor. Furthermore, the phagocytic abilities for microspheres and bioparticle uptake significantly decreased in these two cell populations upon CuO NPs or Cu ions; meanwhile, antigen presentation of MO/MD and antibody production of IgM+ B cells were also inhibited. However, vitamin C supplementation reversed all these biochemical indices, as well as cell apoptosis and phagocytic abilities in MO/MD and IgM+ B cells that were induced by CuO NPs or Cu ions. In conclusion, these results revealed that vitamin C exerts cytoprotective effects against oxidative damage through its antioxidant properties and may be of therapeutic use in preventing toxicological effects caused by copper exposure.","output":"Vitamin C suppresses toxicological effects in MO/MD and IgM+ B cells of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) upon copper exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To reach global immunization goals, national programs need to balance routine immunization at health facilities with vaccination campaigns and other outreach activities (e.g. vaccination weeks), which boost coverage at particular times and help reduce geographic inequalities. However, where routine immunization is weak, an overreliance on vaccination campaigns may lead to heterogeneous coverage. Here, we assessed the impact of a health system strengthening (HSS) intervention on the relative contribution of routine immunization and outreach activities to reach immunization goals in rural Madagascar. Methods: We obtained data from health centers in Ifanadiana district on the monthly number of recommended vaccines (BCG, measles, DTP and Polio) delivered to children, during 2014-2018. We also analyzed data from a district-representative cohort carried out every two years in over 1500 households in 2014-2018. We compared changes inside and outside the HSS catchment in the delivery of recommended vaccines, population-level vaccination coverage, geographic and economic inequalities in coverage, and timeliness of vaccination. The impact of HSS was quantified via mixed-effects logistic regressions. Results: The HSS intervention was associated with a significant increase in immunization rates (Odds Ratio between 1.22 for measles and 1.49 for DTP), which diminished over time. Outreach activities were associated with a doubling in immunization rates, but their effect was smaller in the HSS catchment. Analysis of cohort data revealed that HSS was associated with higher vaccination coverage (Odds Ratio between 1.18 per year of HSS for measles and 1.43 for BCG), a reduction in economic inequality, and a higher proportion of timely vaccinations. Yet, the lower contribution of outreach activities in the HSS catchment was associated with persistent inequalities in geographic coverage, which prevented achieving international coverage targets. Conclusion: Investment in stronger primary care systems can improve vaccination coverage, reduce inequalities and improve the timeliness of vaccination via increases in routine immunizations.","output":"Impact of health system strengthening on delivery strategies to improve child immunization coverage and inequalities in rural Madagascar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Minimally invasive surgery for total mesorectal excision (TME) remains technically challenging due to poor maneuverability within the pelvis, which makes extremely difficult to introduce a laparoscopic stapler (LS) for the rectal transection.

A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Database. Participants who underwent robotic anterior resection were considered following these criteria: (1) studies comparing RS and LS; (2) studies reporting the rate of anastomotic leakage (AL). The primary outcome was the risk of AL. Secondary outcomes included the number of firings of stapler needed. A meta-analysis based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement was performed. A total of 4 studies including 391 patients (LS = 251, RS = 140) were included for analysis. Regarding the number of firings, overall results suggest that the rectal stapling was achieved with less firings in the RS group, but the difference is not significant [risk difference, (95% CI) 0.42 (- 0.13, 0.97)]. There was a 56% increased odds of AL for LS compared with RS; however, this was not statistically significant (OR: 1.56; 95% CI 0.59, 4.14). With the current literature evidence, the present study could not demonstrate a clear benefit of the RS over the LS.

There is little evidence in the literature assessing its effect on patients with Covid-19. With this in mind, we performed a retrospective study of patients receiving treatment with prone-position in the context of Covid-19, and have assessed its impact on efficiency of ventilation (dead space ratio), oxygenation (P/F ratio) and mortality. METHODS We included all patients admitted to our 18 bed ICU with either PCR-confirmed or clinically presumed diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia, who were under mechanical ventilation and completed two or more full proning cycles in the period 03/12/2020-04/12/2020. Demographic characteristics, data on mechanical ventilation, patient position, end tidal CO2 and arterial blood gas were obtained from patient charts. Pa/FiO2 ratios (P/F) were calculated as a marker of oxygenation and dead space fraction (Vd/Vt) to assess ventilation. RESULTS Twelve patients were studied. There was a statistically significant improvement in P/F ratio when prone compared to supine (Wilcoxon signed-rank Z=12, p&lt;0.01) with more than a 20% increase. There was no statistically significant change in Vd/Vt ratio on proning (p&gt;0.05). Over time, Vd/Vt increased in non-survivors (Rs=0.48, p&lt;0.01), whilst remained flat in survivors (Rs=0.002, p=0.97). See Figure 1. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that prone position in patients with Covid-19 has little effect on dead space fraction, but does improve oxygenation. This poses the question as to whether this therapy adds anything to the management of Covid-19 patients-aside from a transient improvement in oxygenation that would buy time for additional therapies to succeed. In non-survivors, we observed a progressive rise in Vd/Vt over time. This was not the case in survivors, as seen in ARDS, where a rise in Vd/Vt has been shown to be a prognostic marker for death. With regards to response to prone position, only improvements in Vd/Vt (but not in P/F ratio) have been shown to be prognostic. Our findings seem to replicate this in Covid-19 patients. We propose the regular calculation of Vd/Vt as an easy tool to assess the progress of Covid-19 patients. Our sample size was small and contained mainly our sickest Covid-19 patients due a high number of inter-trust bed pressure transfers. Drawing firm conclusions from this data is thus not possible however we believe it to still be valuable. Further work is required to show a replication of our findings on a larger scale.

Because of health emergencies during this period, widespread fear has resulted in compromised patient safety, especially for patients with cancer. It is very challenging to treat such cancer patients because of the complexity of providing care and treatment, along with COVID-19. Hence, an effective treatment comparison strategy is needed. We need to have a handy tool to understand cancer progression in this unprecedented scenario. Linking different events of cancer progression is the need of the hour. It is a huge challenge for the development of new methodology. METHODS This article explores the time lag effect and makes a statistical inference about the best experimental arm using Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model and regression methods. The work is presented as the occurrence of other events as a hazard rate after the first event (relapse). The time lag effect between the events is linked and analysed. RESULTS The results were presented as a comprehensive analytical strategy by joining all disease progression. An AFT model applied with the transition states, and the dependency structure between the gap times was used by the auto-regression model. The effects of arms were compared using the coefficient of auto-regression and accelerated failure time (AFT) models.

Policies that have been imposed by different countries to slow the spread of the disease, including national lockdowns, curfews, border closures and enforcement of social distancing measures have disturbed the drug supply chain and resulted in drug shortages. Uncertainty concerning the pandemic has also led to the panic buying of drugs and the stockpiling of drugs in households, which has amplified the problem. In this cross-sectional study, a self-developed questionnaire was distributed online in order to a) assess the practice of household drug stockpiling prior to the national lockdown in Jordan, b) investigate the factors affecting it and c) measure peoples knowledge about the consequences of this behaviour. Results from this study show that drug purchasing was reported by 44.3% of the participants and was most common among participants from non-medical backgrounds (336, 75.7%) or those who have chronic diseases (261, 58.8%) and taking chronic supplements (282, 63.5%) regardless of their age, gender, living area or the possession of health insurance. Analgesics and antipyretics were the most frequently purchased drugs (225, 70.5%) and anticipation of their need was the most common reason for purchasing drugs (231, 52.0%). Buyers were also less aware, when compared to non-buyers, that panic buying and drug stockpiling may lead to drug shortages (204, 45.9% vs 325, 58.1%) and that this behaviour can pose a health hazard, especially to children (221, 47.5% vs 342, 61.2%).

Our estimate suggests that over 12 billion medical and fabric face masks are discarded monthly, giving the likelihood that an equivalent of about 105,000 tonnes of face masks per month could be disposed into the environment by Africans. In general, 15 out of 57 African countries are significant plastic waste contributors with Nigeria (15%), Ethiopia (8.6%), Egypt (7.6%), DR Congo (6.7%), Tanzania (4.5%), and South Africa (4.4%) topping the list. Therefore, this expert insight is an attempt to draw the attention of governments, healthcare agencies, and the public to the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2-generated plastics (COVID plastic wastes), and the environmental impacts that could exacerbate the existing plastic pollution epidemic after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and Emerging Plastic-based Personal Protective Equipment Waste Pollution and Management in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate how emphysema extent and its regional distribution quantified by chest CT are associated with clinical and functional severity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods/Design: Patients with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.70, without any other obstructive airway disease, who presented radiological evidence of emphysema on visual CT inspection were retrospectively enrolled. A Quantitative Lung Imaging (QUALI) system automatically quantified the volume of pulmonary emphysema and adjusted this volume to the measured (EmphCT(LV)) or predicted total lung volume (TLV) (EmphP(LV)) and assessed its regional distribution based on an artificial neural network (ANN) trained for this purpose. Additionally, the percentage of lung volume occupied by low-attenuation areas (LAA) was computed by dividing the total volume of regions with attenuation lower or equal to ?950 Hounsfield units (HU) by the predicted [LAA (%P(LV))] or measured CT lung volume [LAA (%CT(LV))]. The LAA was then compared with the QUALI emphysema estimations. The association between emphysema extension and its regional distribution with pulmonary function impairment was then assessed. Results: In this study, 86 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Both EmphCT(LV) and EmphP(LV) were significantly lower than the LAA indices independently of emphysema severity. CT-derived TLV significantly increased with emphysema severity (from 6,143  1,295 up to 7,659  1,264 ml from mild to very severe emphysema, p < 0.005) and thus, both EmphCT(LV) and LAA significantly underestimated emphysema extent when compared with those values adjusted to the predicted lung volume. All CT-derived emphysema indices presented moderate to strong correlations with residual volume (RV) (with correlations ranging from 0.61 to 0.66), total lung capacity (TLC) (from 0.51 to 0.59), and FEV(1) (~0.6) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide DL(CO) (~0.6). The values of FEV(1) and DL(CO) were significantly lower, and RV (p < 0.001) and TLC (p < 0.001) were significantly higher with the increasing emphysema extent and when emphysematous areas homogeneously affected the lungs. Conclusions: Emphysema volume must be referred to the predicted and not to the measured lung volume when assessing the CT-derived emphysema extension. Pulmonary function impairment was greater in patients with higher emphysema volumes and with a more homogeneous emphysema distribution. Further studies are still necessary to assess the significance of CTpLV in the clinical and research fields.","output":"Pulmonary Emphysema Regional Distribution and Extent Assessed by Chest Computed Tomography Is Associated With Pulmonary Function Impairment in Patients With COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtually every country in the world has been affected by COVID-19.

In the present study, left atrial appendage samples were obtained at heart surgery from nonvalvular AF and non-AF patients without atrial thrombus. Immunohistochemistry for endocardial markers including thrombomodulin (TM) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) was performed and semiquantitatively graded. In immunohistochemistry analysis, decreased expression of TM was found in patients with nonvalvular AF compared with those without AF ( P < .001). There was no difference in TFPI expression between the 2 groups ( P = .213). Patients with TM score of 0 or 1 seemed to have larger left atrial diameter (LAD) than those with TM score of 2 or 3 (44.0 (7.9) vs 40.6 (3.9); P = .009), while no relationship between LAD and TFPI expression was found (43.4 (7.0) vs 42.9 (7.8); P = .485). In conclusion, TM expression in the atrial endocardium is decreased in nonvalvular AF without atrial thrombus, while TFPI expression is not.

Flavor-representing the integration of olfaction (smell) with gustation (physiologic taste) and as influenced by oral somatosenses-is rarely afforded attention in oral research and dental practice. This article considers the interrelationship between oral health and flavor and highlights gaps in current knowledge. Altered oral function associated with operative and restorative treatment can feasibly alter the perception of flavor through diverse ways. Oral diseases and the generation of biofilms on restorative materials have potential to influence the oral microbiota and the perception of flavor. Alterations in masticatory function (through tooth loss, restorative materials, and prostheses with nonbiological surfaces and shapes) compounded by associated influences in the composition and quantity of saliva can affect the release of odorants and tastants from foods and beverages. Furthermore, changes occur in the perception of flavor throughout life and are significant in the aging and medically compromised population with the potential to affect nutrition and pleasure. Dental research and clinical practice should be at the forefront of biomedical science in understanding and promoting the importance and relevance of flavor in the well-being of patients. However, more research is required to guide clinical practice in consideration of olfactory and gustatory function as a component of total patient care.Knowledge Transfer Statement: This commentary highlights the research gaps in knowledge pertaining to the association between oral health and flavor and the significance of flavor to dental practice.","output":"Oral Health Impacts on Flavor and Significance in Dental Treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to conduct a scoping review of the available service delivery models related to home-based fall prevention programs led by rehabilitation professionals and to describe the path to launching one such program entitled Home-based Older Persons Upstreaming Prevention Physical Therapy (HOP-UP-PT).

However, some argue that HPV vaccine recipients may engage in risky compensatory sexual behaviours because of perceived protection afforded by the vaccine. Therefore, we investigated the impact of a wide-scale HPV vaccination programme on sexual behaviours among adolescent women in Rwanda-the first African country to implement a national HPV vaccination. We identified a cohort of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccination and those who were not eligible from the most recent Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. We used a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design, exploiting the quasi-random change in HPV vaccination eligibility in 2011, to compare sexual behaviours among vaccinated and unvaccinated adolescent women. We studied the impact of the vaccination on reported sexual intercourse, average number of sexual partners and teenage pregnancy across the vaccination eligibility threshold. Our analysis included 3052 adolescent women (mean age: 18.6 years), of whom 58% were eligible for HPV vaccination. Nearly one in five adolescents reported having had sexual intercourse (18.5%). The average reported lifetime number of sexual partners was 1.41. The proportion of teenage pregnancy was 5.3%. We found no evidence that HPV vaccination was associated with any significant changes across the eligibility threshold in reported sexual behaviours we studied: no significant increase in the proportion of having sexual intercourse [odds ratio (OR): 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57-1.12; P = 0.19], in lifetime number of sexual partners (rate ratio 0.99, 95% CI: 0.83-1.17, P = 0.91) and in the proportion of teen pregnancies (OR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.50 to 2.20, P = 0.89) at the eligibility threshold.

To solve this problem, we have used a wet etching technique to fabricate 23 nm wide nanostructures randomly aligned as ridges on aluminum (Al) 6063 alloy surfaces. The surfaces were etched for 0.5, 1, and 3 h. The surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy. Strains of the Gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus were used to evaluate the bacterial attachment behavior. For the first time, common respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), were investigated for antiviral activity on nanostructured surfaces. It was found that the etched Al surfaces were hydrophilic and the nanoscale roughness enhanced with the etching time with Rrms ranging from 69.9 to 995 nm. Both bacterial cells of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were physically deformed and were nonviable upon attachment after 3 h on the etched Al 6063 surface. This nanoscale surface topography inactivated 92 and 87% of the attached P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cells, respectively. The recovery of infectious RSV was also reduced significantly within 2 h of exposure to the nanostructured surfaces compared to the smooth Al control surfaces. There was a 3-4 log10 reduction in the viability counts of rhinovirus after 24 h on the nanostructured surfaces. The nanostructured surfaces exhibited excellent durability as the surfaces sustained 1000 cycles of 2000 N load without any damage. This is the first report that has shown the combined antibacterial and antiviral property of the nanostructured surface with excellent nanomechanical properties that could be potentially significant for use in hospital environments to stop the spread of infections arising from physical surfaces.","output":"Antiviral and Antibacterial Nanostructured Surfaces with Excellent Mechanical Properties for Hospital Applications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) and its spread, with life-threatening outcomes, have caused a pandemic burden worldwide.

To examine the contribution of immunity to the pathogenesis of JHMV in the central nervous system (CNS), mice were exposed to immunosuppressive doses of x-irradiation 3 days post infection and observed for clinical and pathological evidence of acute and subacute demyelination. Irradiated mice were found to have a nearly thousand-fold increase in central nervous system virus titer, as well as the presence of both abundant virus and viral antigen in white matter cells with the morphological characteristics of oligodendrocytes. Nonetheless, infected, irradiated mice had little or no evidence of demyelination or destruction of CNS cells. Adoptive transfers of spleen cells from syngeneic JHMV-immunized donors into irradiated JHMV-infected mice were carried out in order to determine the effect of immune reconstitution on pathogenesis. Splenocytes from JHMV-immune donors, but not naive donors or donors immunized with irrelevant antigen, completely restored demyelination in irradiated, JHMV-infected recipients. Depletion of Thy-1+ cells by treatment with monoclonal antibody and complement abolished the ability to transfer demyelination. We conclude that: 1) JHMV infection of the CNS does not result in acute or subacute demyelination in the absence of an intact immune response, and 2) viral-specific Thy-1+ cells are an essential element in the induction of demyelinating CNS lesions that result from JHMV infection.","output":"Interaction of immune and central nervous systems: contribution of anti-viral Thy-1+ cells to demyelination induced by coronavirus JHM."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) may be at risk of complications from COVID-19 but the impact of COVID-19 on pwCF remains unknown.

DESIGN.: We surveyed our pathologists (all subspecialized) and trainees to gather information about their use of digital pathology tools before and during the pandemic. Quality assurance and slide distribution data were also examined. RESULTS.: During the pandemic, the widespread usage of digital tools in our institution allowed a smooth transition of most clinical and academic activities into remote with no major disruptions. The number of pathologists using whole slide imaging (WSI) for primary diagnosis increased from 20 (62.5%) to 29 (90.6%) out of a total 32 (100 %) pathologists, excluding renal pathology and hematopathology, during the pandemic.

They are prone to acquiring the infection and are threatened by high mortality rates in case of infection. However, HD patients were not included in the efficacy trials of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Such efficacy data would have been critical because HD patients show decreased responses against various other vaccines and this could translate to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as well. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study that contained a group of 81 HD patients and 80 healthy controls. All of them had been vaccinated with the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA vaccine (two doses, as per the manufacturer's recommendation). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody response was measured for all participants 21 days after the second dose. The groups were compared using univariate quantile regressions and a multivariate analysis. The adverse events (AEs) of the vaccination were assessed via a questionnaire. Finally, a correlation between the HBs-Antibody response and the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in the HD patients was established. RESULTS: The HD patients had significantly lower Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titres than the control patients 21 days after vaccination (median was 171 U/ml for dialysis patients and 2,500 U/ml for the controls). Further, the HD group presented less AEs than the control group. No correlation was found between the antibody response to previous Hepatitis B vaccination and that of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

To understand the service quality in intensive care units (ICUs), we investigated the expected and perceived service quality of ICU care. METHODS: We conducted this study at an ICU of a university-affiliated medical center in Taiwan from April to September 2019. Admitted patients or their family members responded to a questionnaire survey adopted from the SERVQUAL instrument consisting of 22 items in five dimensions. The questionnaire was provided on ICU admission for expectation and before ICU discharge for perception. We analyzed the quality gaps between the surveys and applied important-performance analysis (IPA). RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included (62.4% males, average age: 65.9 years, average length of stay: 10.1 days, and 76.9% survival to ICU discharge). The overall weighted mean scores for the surveys were similar (4.57  0.81 and 4.58  0.52, respectively). The tangibles dimension had a higher perception than expectation (3.99  0.55 and 4.31  0.63 for expectation and perception, respectively, p < 0.001). IPA showed that most of the items in reliability, responsiveness and assurance were located in the quadrant of high expectation and high perception, whereas most of the items in tangibles and empathy were located in the quadrant of low expectation and low perception. One item (item 1 for tangibles) was found in the quadrant of high expectation and low perception.

Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province. In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population.

Asynchronous e-learning can be grouped into interactive (user-influenceable content) and noninteractive (static material) e-learning. Studies conducted in high-income countries suggest that interactive e-learning is more effective than noninteractive e-learning in increasing learner satisfaction and knowledge; however, there is a gap in our understanding of whether this also holds true in LMICs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to validate the hypothesis above in a resource-constrained and real-life setting to understand e-learning quality and delivery by comparing interactive and noninteractive e-learning user satisfaction, usability, and knowledge gain in a new medical university in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a web-based, mixed methods randomized controlled trial at the Levy Mwanawasa Medical University (LMMU) in Lusaka, Zambia, between April and July 2021. We recruited medical licentiate students (second, third, and fourth study years) via email. Participants were randomized to undergo asynchronous e-learning with an interactive or noninteractive module for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and informally blinded to their group allocation. The interactive module included interactive interfaces, quizzes, and a virtual patient, whereas the noninteractive module consisted of PowerPoint slides. Both modules covered the same content scope. The primary outcome was learner satisfaction. The secondary outcomes were usability, short- and long-term knowledge gain, and barriers to e-learning. The mixed methods study followed an explanatory sequential design in which rating conferences delivered further insights into quantitative findings, which were evaluated through web-based questionnaires. RESULTS: Initially, 94 participants were enrolled in the study, of whom 41 (44%; 18 intervention participants and 23 control participants) remained in the study and were analyzed. There were no significant differences in satisfaction (intervention: median 33.5, first quartile 31.3, second quartile 35; control: median 33, first quartile 30, second quartile 37.5; P=.66), usability, or knowledge gain between the intervention and control groups. Challenges in accessing both e-learning modules led to many dropouts. Qualitative data suggested that the content of the interactive module was more challenging to access because of technical difficulties and individual factors (eg, limited experience with interactive e-learning). CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe an increase in user satisfaction with interactive e-learning. However, this finding may not be generalizable to other low-resource settings because the post hoc power was low, and the e-learning system at LMMU has not yet reached its full potential. Consequently, technical and individual barriers to accessing e-learning may have affected the results, mainly because the interactive module was considered more difficult to access and use.

Measurements of UVBF normalized for fetal abdominal circumference (UVBF/AC), atrial area (AA) and ventricular sphericity indices (SI) were compared between the two study groups. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were sued to analyze the data. RESULTS Fifty-four consecutive pregnancies complicated and 108 not complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The median gestational age at infection was 30.2 (interquartile range [IQR] 26.2 34.1). General baseline and pregnancy characteristics were similar between pregnant women with compared to those without SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no difference in UVBF/AC (study groups z value -0.11 vs. 0.14 control p 0.751) values between pregnancies complicated compared to those not complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Transient production of spike in both human embryonic kidney (HEK) and CHO cells mediated by polyethyleneimine was increased significantly (up to 10.9-fold) by a reduction in culture temperature to 32C to permit extended duration cultures. Based on these data GS-CHO pools stably producing spike trimer under the control of a strong synthetic promoter were cultured in hypothermic conditions with combinations of bioactive small molecules to increase yield of purified spike product 4.9-fold to 53 mg/L. Purification of recombinant spike by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography initially yielded a variety of co-eluting protein impurities identified as host cell derived by mass spectrometry, which were separated from spike trimer using a modified imidazole gradient elution. Purified CHO spike trimer antigen was used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in sera from patient cohorts previously tested for viral infection by polymerase chain reaction, including those who had displayed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. The antibody assay, validated to ISO 15189 Medical Laboratories standards, exhibited a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 92.3%.

Recent experience with developing and testing viral vaccine candidates can inform expectations regarding the development of safe and effective vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To estimate timelines and probabilities of success for recent vaccine candidates. DESIGN: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify trials testing viral vaccines that had not advanced to phase 2 before 2005, and the progress of each vaccine from phase 1 through to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure was tracked. Trial characteristics were double-coded. (Registration: Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/dmuzx/]). SETTING: Trials launched between January 2005 and March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Preventive viral vaccine candidates for 23 emerging or reemerged viral infectious diseases. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was the probability of vaccines advancing from launch of phase 2 to FDA licensure within 10 years. RESULTS: In total, 606 clinical trials forming 220 distinct development trajectories (267 343 enrolled participants) were identified. The probability of vaccines progressing from phase 2 to licensure within 10 years was 10.0% (95% CI, 2.6% to 16.9%), with most approvals representing H1N1 or H5N1 vaccines. The average timeline from phase 2 to approval was 4.4 years (range, 6.4 weeks to 13.9 years). The probabilities of advancing from phase 1 to 2, phase 2 to 3, and phase 3 to licensure within the total available follow-up time were 38.2% (CI, 30.7% to 45.0%), 38.3% (CI, 23.1% to 50.5%), and 61.1% (CI, 3.7% to 84.3%), respectively. LIMITATIONS: The study did not account for preclinical development and relied primarily on ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA resources. Success probabilities do not capture the varied reasons why vaccines fail to advance to regulatory approval. CONCLUSION: Success probabilities and timelines varied widely across different vaccine types and diseases. If a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is licensed within 18 months of the start of the pandemic, it will mark an unprecedented achievement for noninfluenza viral vaccine development.

PARTICIPANT AND METHODS: A 30-year-old man with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral acute conjunctivitis which occurred 13 days after illness onset. Based on detailed ophthalmic examination, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in conjunctival swabs. The ocular characteristics, presence of viral RNA and viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated. RESULTS: Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis.

We compared the rates of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after renal transplantation in patients with and without pre-transplant diabetes. Furthermore, we investigated whether transplant era and recipient age affected the association between diabetes status and adverse events. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 691 patients who underwent renal transplantation between 1994 and 2016 at a single tertiary center. We compared the incidences of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE in patients with and without pre-transplant diabetes using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model, and assessed the interactions between diabetes status and transplant era and recipient age. RESULTS Of 691 kidney recipients, 143 (20.7%) had pre-transplant diabetes. The mean follow-up duration was 94.5 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with pre-transplant diabetes had higher incidences of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE compared with those without pre-transplant diabetes (log rank test, p < 0.001 for both). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, pre-transplant diabetes was associated with an increased risk of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; confidence interval [CI], 1.05-3.44; p = 0.034; and HR, 1.75; CI, 1.02-3.00; p = 0.043, respectively).

BACKGROUND Both FFR and percent FFR increase measured after PCI showed incremental prognostic implications. However, there is no current method to predict post-PCI physiological results using physiological assessment in the pre-PCI phase. METHODS An automated algorithm that analyzes instantaneous FFR gradient per unit time (dFFR(t)/dt) was developed from the derivation cohort (n = 30). Using dFFR(t)/dt, the pattern of atherosclerotic disease in each patient was classified into 3 groups (major, mixed, and minor FFR gradient groups) in both the internal validation cohort with constant pullback method (n = 234) and the external validation cohort with nonstandardized pullback methods (n = 252). All patients in the validation cohorts underwent PCI on the basis of pre-PCI FFR 0.80. Suboptimal post-PCI physiological results were defined as both post-PCI FFR <0.84 and percent FFR increase 15%. From the derivation cohort, cutoffs of dFFR(t)/dt for major and minor FFR gradient were 0.035/s and 0.015/s, respectively. RESULTS In validation cohorts, dFFR(t)/dt showed significant correlations with percent FFR increase (R = 0.801; p < 0.001) and post-PCI FFR (R = 0.099; p = 0.029). In both the internal and external validation cohorts, the major FFR gradient group showed significantly higher post-PCI FFR and percent FFR increase compared with those in the mixed or minor FFR gradient groups (all p values <0.001). The proportions of suboptimal post-PCI physiological results were significantly different among 3 groups (10.4% vs. 25.8% vs. 45.7% for the major, mixed, and minor FFR gradient groups, respectively; p < 0.001) in validation cohorts. Absence of major FFR gradient lesion (odds ratio: 2.435, 95% [CI]: 1.252 to 4.734; p = 0.009) and presence of minor FFR gradient lesion (odds ratio: 2.756, 95% confidence interval: 1.629 to 4.664; p < 0.001) were independent predictors for suboptimal post-PCI physiological results. CONCLUSIONS The automated algorithm analyzing pre-PCI pullback curve was able to predict post-PCI physiological results.

DESIGN Consecutive patients who underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomies were case matched to patients who underwent multiport laparoscopic colectomies by age, operation, surgeon, diagnosis, and body mass index. Data from a prospective database and the medical records of patients treated were reviewed. SETTINGS This study took place at 2 tertiary care hospitals. PATIENTS Forty-six consecutive patients with a body mass index of 24 underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomies (24 right, 18 sigmoid, 4 low anterior resection). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Perioperative outcomes and cosmesis and body image scores at 90 days were compared. RESULTS The largest incision length was significantly shorter for the single-incision group. Two patients with single incisions were converted to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery and 4 required placement of a 5-mm trocar. A significantly greater portion of the operation was performed by the attending surgeons in the single-incision group. For right colectomies, operative times were similar. For left colectomies, operative time (149  30 vs 126  21 min) was significantly longer for the single-incision group. Time to flatus and bowel movements were significantly shorter for the single-incision group, but length of stay was similar. Cosmetic score was higher for the single-incision group (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS Single incision is equivalent to multiport laparoscopic colectomy with regard to safety and efficacy with smaller incision size and higher cosmetic scores.

The management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has primarily impacted emergency departments, medical teams, and intensive care units. However, the impact on health systems as a whole, including surgical specialties, has been wide ranging. We aimed to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown on the number and characteristics of general surgical patients reviewed and/or admitted by the surgical team within a district general hospital.

Numerous ongoing and recently published studies about the disease have emerged. However, the research regarding COVID-19 is largely ongoing and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: A potential way to accelerate COVID-19 research is to use existing information gleaned from research into other viruses that belong to the coronavirus family. Our objective is to develop a natural language processing method for answering factoid questions related to COVID-19 using published articles as knowledge sources. METHODS: Given a question, first, a BM25-based context retriever model is implemented to select the most relevant passages from previously published articles. Second, for each selected context passage, an answer is obtained using a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) question-answering model. Third, an opinion aggregator, which is a combination of a biterm topic model and k-means clustering, is applied to the task of aggregating all answers into several opinions. RESULTS: We applied the proposed pipeline to extract answers, opinions, and the most frequent words related to six questions from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. By showing the longitudinal distributions of the opinions, we uncovered the trends of opinions and popular words in the articles published in the five time periods assessed: before 1990, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2018, and since 2019. The changes in opinions and popular words agree with several distinct characteristics and challenges of COVID-19, including a higher risk for senior people and people with pre-existing medical conditions; high contagion and rapid transmission; and a more urgent need for screening and testing. The opinions and popular words also provide additional insights for the COVID-19-related questions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other methods of literature retrieval and answer generation, opinion aggregation using our method leads to more interpretable, robust, and comprehensive question-specific literature reviews.

Its incidence rate appears to have increased substantially in Western societies during the mid-20th century and continues to increase at 1%/year.

The delayed infection hypothesis, first formulated in 1988, parallels the hygiene hypothesis and has an evolutionary foundation in the concept of a mismatch between prior genetic selection and programming (of the immune system) and contemporary social circumstances. In essence, the hypothesis predicts that ALL is triggered by an abnormal immune response to one or more common microbial infections and that the abnormality arises for two reasons: (i) infectious exposures being delayed beyond the immunologically anticipated period of infancy; (ii) some degree of inherited genetic susceptibility via, for example, allelic variation in genes involved in the MHC and/or immune response network. The hypothesis also has a framework in the underlying cell and molecular biology of ALL and its natural history. Epidemiological studies of social contacts in infancy (as a proxy for common infections) and risk of ALL provide indirect but strong support for the hypothesis. The idea still requires mechanistic and genetic endorsement and the appropriate studies are in progress.","output":"The delayed infection (aka hygiene) hypothesis for childhood leukaemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The digitalization of the healthcare system poses new challenges for physicians. Thus, the relevance of learning digital competencies (DiCo), such as dealing with data sets, apply telemedicine or using apps, is already growing in medical education. DiCo should be clearly separated from digitized teaching formats, which have been increasingly used since the COVID 19 pandemic. This article outlines the faculties in Germany where DiCo are already integrated into medical education. Methods: Courses with DiCo as teaching content were collected by a literature research on Pubmed and Google as well as by contacting all dean's offices and other persons responsible for teaching at German medical faculties. The courses were summarized in a table. Results: In a first survey, 16 universities were identified that offer courses on DiCo. In the elective area at the universities, 17 courses and in the compulsory area eight courses could be identified. The scope and content of the courses diverged between compulsory curricula, integrated courses of different lengths, and elective courses that are one-time or longitudinally integrated. The topics taught are heterogeneous and include fundamentals of medical informatics such as data management on the one hand and a collection of e.g. ethics, law, apps, artificial intelligence, telemedicine and robotics on the other hand. Conclusion: Currently, only some German medical faculties offer courses on DiCo. These courses vary in scope and design. They are frequently part of the elective curriculum and only reach some of the students. The possibility of embedding DiCo in the already existing cross-sectional area appears limited. In view of the ongoing digitalization of healthcare, it is necessary to make future courses on DiCo accessible to all medical students. In order to drive this expansion forward, the implementation of the new learning objectives catalogue, in which DiCo are integrated, a network formation, a teaching qualification as well as the involvement of students is recommended.","output":"Overview of digital health teaching courses in medical education in Germany in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is one of the life-threatening neurosurgical diseases in central nervous system. Autophagy has been previously demonstrated to exert vital roles in SAH development. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been revealed as a regulator of autophagy in neurosurgical diseases. However, effect of ACE2 on autophagy in SAH progression has not been clarified. First, we explored the relationship between autophagy and SAH progression by establishing a mouse model of SAH under the administration of 3-MA (the autophagy inhibitor). Next, we examined ACE2 expression in the cerebral cortex of SAH mice ex vivo with RT-qPCR. Subsequently, we assessed the biological function of ACE2 on brain injury, the autophagic flux pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling ex vivo via neurological scoring, TUNEL assay, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining assay. Finally, we carried out rescue assays under chloroquine (CQ, the autophagic flux inhibitor) and LY294002 (the PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitor) administration. 3-MA mitigated brain injury after SAH, and ACE2 was downregulated in cerebral cortex of SAH mice. Moreover, ACE2 elevation alleviated cell apoptosis, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits, ameliorated the autophagic flux pathway and activated the PI3K/AKT signaling in SAH mice. Furthermore, CQ and LY294002 neutralized the effects of overexpressed ACE2 on neuronal apoptosis, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits in SAH mice. Overall, ACE2 lessened neuronal injury via the autophagic flux and PI3K/AKT pathways. This research might provide a potential novel direction for clinical treatment of SAH.

Despite the fact that over 90% of children with COVID-19 had asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease, new worries about hyperinflammatory states or Kawasaki-like disease have surfaced. Materials and Methods: We would like to present 17 patients with different patterns of myocardial involvement. They were selected from our database of 214 patients (19 newborns) hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment in our pediatrics clinic from March 2020 to October 2020. Selection criteria involved cardiac involvement in terms of positive laboratory findings (elevated troponin I) electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. Results: Cardiac involvement was detected in only 17 (7.9%) of the 214 hospitalized patients. Patients were grouped into three categories according to their hospitalization units which were neonatal intensive care, pediatric intensive care and pediatric inpatient clinic. Most of our patients (88.2%) had elevated troponin I levels whereas 12 patients (70.5%) had abnormal electrocardiograms and echocardiographic exams. Fourteen (82.3%) of patients with high troponin I levels had also abnormal electrocardiograms whereas 13 (76.4%) of them had abnormal echocardiographic exams. Conclusion: Although we did not observe cardiac involvement in most of the patients (92.1%) hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment in our pediatrics clinic, subjects with involvement had quite diverse patterns ranging from only troponin I elevation to the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children needing arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. ? 2021, Galenos Publishing House.

METHODS: We conducted two household surveys among the non-institutionalized adult population from May 30 to June 17, 2020, in Lajeado, an 84,000-inhabitants industrial city in southern Brazil. Primary outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths occurring up to June 20, 2020. We summarized prevalence rates across surveys with meta-analysis. We assessed age-range IFR and hospitalization rate and regressed these rates over age strata using nonlinear coefficients of determination (R(2)). RESULTS: Summarized overall prevalence was 3.40% (95% CI, 2.74 to 4.18), 34% lower in elderly 60 years-old. IFR ranged from 0.08% (0.06 to 0.11) to 4.63% (2.93 to 7.84) in individuals 20 to 39 years-old and 60 years-old, respectively. R(2) for exponential age-dependent hospitalization rate and IFR were 0.98 and 0.93 (both p-values <0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study in Brazil to estimate COVID-19 prevalence, hospitalization and fatality rates per age stratum. Rates were largely age-dependent.

Our objectives were to define the frequency of myocardial injury using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and to understand how to use its prognostic abilities. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in Italy in 2020. Hs-cTnI was sampled based on clinical judgment. Myocardial injury was defined as values above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limits (URLs). Most data is from the initial hospital value. RESULTS: 426 unique patients were included. Hs-cTnI was measured in 313 (73.5%) patients; 85 (27.2%) had myocardial injury at baseline. Patients with myocardial injury had higher mortality during hospitalization (hazard ratio = 9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55C17.79], p < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis including clinical and laboratory variables demonstrated an AUC of 0.942 with modest additional value of hs-cTnI. Myocardial injury was associated with mortality in patients with low APACHE II scores (<13) [OR (95% CI): 4.15 (1.40, 14.22), p = 0.014] but not in those with scores > 13 [OR (95% CI): 0.48 (0.08, 2.65), p = 0.40].

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare, side by side, the cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) response bilaterally to carotid artery clamping and shunting in patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia. With institutional approval and written informed consent, patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia and routine carotid artery shunting were recorded bilaterally, simultaneously and continuously with an rSO2 and processed EEG monitor. The response of the monitors during carotid artery clamping and shunting were assessed and compared between monitors and bilaterally within each monitor. Sixty-nine patients were included in the study. At clamping the surgical-side and contralateral-side rSO2 dropped significantly below the baseline incision value (-17.6 and -9.4% respectively). After shunting, the contralateral-side rSO2 returned to baseline while the surgical-side rSO2 remained significantly below baseline (-9.0%) until the shunt was removed following surgery. At clamping the surgical-side and contralateral-side processed EEG also dropped below baseline (-19.9 and -20.6% respectively). However, following shunt activation, the processed EEG returned bilaterally to baseline. During the course of this research, we found the rSO2 monitor to be clinically more robust (4.4% failure rate) than the processed EEG monitor (20.0% failure rate). There was no correlation between the rSO2 or processed EEG changes that occurred immediately after clamping and the degree of surgical side stenosis measured pre-operatively. Both rSO2 and processed EEG respond to clamping and shunting during CEA. Cerebral oximetry discriminates between the surgical and contralateral side during surgery. The rSO2 monitor is more reliable in the real-world clinical setting. Future studies should focus on developing algorithms based on these monitors that can predict clamping-induced cerebral ischemia during CEA in order to decide whether carotid artery shunting is worth the associated risks. From the practical point of view, the rSO2 monitor may be the better monitor for this purpose.","output":"Cerebral oxygenation and processed EEG response to clamping and shunting during carotid endarterectomy under general anesthesia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Taking up the responses some relatively recent immigrants to the United States had to responses to the 2020 Campaign, this article argues for a postnational perspective on (U.S. American) presidential public address.

The epidemiological information of the animals was recorded. The prevalence of the disease was determined using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: The prevalence of BRSV was 83.11%, and it was significantly (p<0.05) higher in cattle aged greater than 7 months-1.5 years than in older animals; in imported cattle than in Native animals; and in animals originating from large herds (100 animals) than in those from smaller herds (40 animals). There was no significant difference between BRSV prevalence in male and female animals. When samples from different regions of the Nineveh Governorate were compared, the northern region was associated with the highest prevalence of the disease. Samples harvested in the winter displayed the highest BRSV titer, compared to those collected during the other seasons. CONCLUSION: BRSV is prevalent in cattle from the Nineveh Governorate. Risk factors such as animal age, origin, herd size, and the herds geographical location are associated with an increased prevalence of the disease in this region.

METHODS Ten of the most common surgical sealing devices were represented in this study, including both mechanical and energy devices. Unfixed porcine carotid arteries were selected for testing. They were connected to a pump, and automated controlled infusion was initiated. Upon identification of a leak at the source of sealing, the maximum pressure in mmHg was logged. RESULTS There were a total of 184 trials conducted using the 10 vessel sealing methods. The average burst pressure across all trials was 1100 mmHg with a range of 51.3-5171 mmHg. Suture-based methods displayed the highest average pressure until failure. Stapling methods showed the lowest burst pressures. All methods showed mean burst pressures above the \\"physiologically relevant\\" level of 250 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS This study presents an independent, reproducible, ex vivo comparison of multiple methods of surgical arterial closure.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate OHNS residency program practice changes and characterize resident perceptions during the initial phase of the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey of U.S. OHNS residents at 81 programs was conducted between March 23, 2020, and March 29, 2020. RESULTS: Eighty-two residents from 51 institutions (63% of invited programs) responded. At the time of survey, 98% of programs had enacted policy changes to minimize COVID-19 spread. These included filtered respirator use for aerosol-generating procedures even in COVID-19-negative patients (85%), decreased resident staffing of surgeries (70%), and reduced frequency of tracheotomy care (61%). The majority of residents (66%) perceived that residents were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to attendings. Residents were most concerned about protective equipment shortage (93%) and transmitting COVID-19 to patients (90%). The majority of residents (73%) were satisfied with their department's COVID-19 response. Resident satisfaction correlated with comfort level in discussing concerns with attendings (r = 0.72, P < .00001) and inversely correlated with perceptions of increased risk compared to attendings (r = -0.52, P < .00001). CONCLUSION: U.S. OHNS residency programs implemented policy changes quickly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were extracted from the national certification program database of the German Roentgen Society (DRG) from 2015-2021. A nationwide online survey among radiology institutes (university hospitals, non-university hospitals, and private practices) was conducted for 2019, and data was extracted from the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) registry. The data collection's key points included the number of centers and individuals certified for CVI, the number of cardiac CT and MRI examinations performed, the reporting habits, and the participation in the ESCR registry. RESULTS 71 centers and 1278 persons, both with a substantial increase since 2015, were registered and certified by the DRG to perform CVI. According to the survey, a total of 69,286 CT and 64,281 MRI examinations were performed annually. Data from the survey and the ESCR registry indicated that reporting was mostly done solely by radiologists or, to a lesser degree, in joint consensus meetings with non-radiologists. The overall participation rate in the ESCR registry was 48 % among the survey's participants. CONCLUSION This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that high-quality CVI by radiologists is available nationwide. The current challenges are to provide the best medical and technical quality of CVI by radiology for patient care and to ensure economic sustainability in the German health care system to accommodate the predicted substantial need for CVI in the future.

The performance of the sensor was tested by monitoring virus samples at clinically relevant concentrations. We show that the Young interferometer sensor can specifically and sensitively detect HSV-1 at very low concentrations (850 particles/mL). We have further demonstrated that the sensor can specifically detect HSV-1 suspended in serum. Extrapolation of the results indicates that the sensitivity of the sensor approaches the detection of a single virus particle binding, yielding a sensor of unprecedented sensitivity with wide applications for viral diagnostics.","output":"Fast, ultrasensitive virus detection using a Young interferometer sensor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This review presents some current thoughts regarding teh epizootiology of the feline coronaviruses; feline infectious peritonisis virus (FIPV) and feline coronavirus (FEVC), with primary emphasis on the pathogenesis of these viruses in nature. Although the mechanism(s) whereby FIPV causes disease are still incompletely understood, there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated. Two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of FIPV and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research. The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 19891, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract. The second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance, which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systematic immunity. In the case of FIPV infection, we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level. Once oral tolerance is disrupted, FIPV is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death. Thus, it may be that clinical forms of FIP are due to a combination of two events, the first being the generation of FIPV from FECV, and the second being the capacity of FIPV to circumvent oral tolerance.","output":"Perspectives on the epizootiology of feline enteric coronavirus and the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been widespread concern that social isolation, financial stress, depression, limited or variable access to health care services and other pandemic-related stressors may contribute to an increase in suicidal behaviors.

As endovascular tools evolve, so too should the imaging. OBJECTIVE To detail the use of microangiography performed with a novel fluoroscope during coiling of intracranial aneurysms in 2 separate patients and discuss the benefits and potential limitations of the technology. METHODS The microangiographic fluoroscope (MAF) is an ultra high-resolution x-ray detector with superior resolution over a small field of view. The MAF can be incorporated into a standard angiographic C-arm system for use during endovascular procedures. RESULTS The MAF was useful for improved visualization during endovascular coiling of 2 unruptured intracranial aneurysms, without adding significant time to the procedure. No significant residual aneurysm filling was identified post-coiling, and no complications occurred. CONCLUSION The MAF is a high-resolution detector developed for use in neurointerventional cases in which superior image quality over a small field of view is required. It has been used with success for coiling of 2 unruptured aneurysms at our institution.

Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey study at seven EM residency programs using a mixed-methods approach designed to understand resident perceptions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their educational experience. Quantitative data were presented as percentages with comparison of subgroups, while open-ended responses were analyzed using qualitative methodology. Results We achieved a 59% response rate (187/313).

Vaccines were quickly developed to address the pandemic. We sought to analyze the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of a non-specified vaccine for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS We constructed a Markov model of COVID-19 infections using Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered structure over a 1-year time horizon from a U.S. healthcare sector perspective. The model consisted of two arms: do nothing and COVID-19 vaccine. Hospitalization and mortality rates were calibrated to U.S. COVID-19 reports as of November 2020. We performed economic calculations of costs in 2020 U.S. dollars and effectiveness in units of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to measure the budget impact and incremental cost-effectiveness at a $100,000/QALY threshold. RESULTS Vaccines have a high probability of reducing healthcare costs and increasing QALYs compared to doing nothing. Simulations showed reductions in hospital-days and mortality by more than 50%. Even though this represents a major U.S. investment, the budget impacts of these technologies could save program costs by up to 60% or more if uptake is high. LIMITATIONS The economic evaluation draws on the reported values of the clinical benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, although we do not currently have long-term conclusive data about COVID-19 vaccine efficacies. CONCLUSIONS Spending on vaccines to mitigate COVID-19 infections offer high-value potential that society should consider. Unusually high uptake in vaccines in a short amount of time could result in unprecedented budget impacts to government and commercial payers.

Kaplan-Meier curves of EAC incidence were stratified by baseline histology. Crude EAC incidence and mortality (all-cause and EAC-specific) were calculated, and adjusted all-cause mortality was assessed. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess predictors of EAC and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Among 4982 patients, 100 (2%) developed EAC (7.8/1000 person-years [PY]) and 9 patients (0.2%) died of EAC (0.7/1000 PY) in a mean 2.7  1.6 years. The incidence of EAC in nondysplastic BE was 0.5/1000 PY. Overall, 157 patients (3%) died during follow-up (all-cause mortality, 11.2/1000 PY). On multivariate logistic regression, baseline BE length (odds ratio, 1.1/ cm) and baseline histology (odds ratios, 5.8 and 50.3 for low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia [HGD] respectively) predicted EAC incidence. Among 9 EAC deaths, 6 (67%) had baseline HGD, and 3 (33%) had baseline intramucosal EAC. The most common causes of death were cardiovascular (15%) and extraesophageal cancers (15%).

DESIGN This research is a retrospective cohort study from a prospectively collected database SETTING This investigation took place in a high-volume tertiary colorectal department. PATIENTS All patients who underwent intra-anal injection of collagen for passive fecal incontinence with internal sphincter dysfunction between January 2006 and December 2009 were included in the study. Data including demographic details, preoperative anorectal physiology, and outcome measures were collected prospectively and maintained in a database MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were the Cleveland Clinic Florida incontinence score and the responses to a subjective patient satisfaction questionnaire before the procedure and at subsequent follow-up visits. Data were analyzed by using SPSS v19.0. RESULTS One hundred patients (70 female; mean age, 61 years (range, 36-82)) were followed up for a minimum duration of 36 months. Fifty-six patients (56%) had an improvement in fecal incontinence score from a mean of 14 (range, 9-18) to a mean of 8 (range, 5-14). A total of 68% reported subjective improvement in symptoms. Thirty-eight patients (38%) required a repeat injection of collagen, and a further 15 patients required a third injection.

Cases showed significantly higher fibrinogen and D-dimer plasma levels versus healthy controls ( p < 0.0001 in both comparisons). Interestingly enough, markedly hypercoagulable thromboelastometry profiles were observed in COVID-19 patients, as reflected by shorter Clot Formation Time (CFT) in INTEM ( p = 0.0002) and EXTEM ( p = 0.01) and higher Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) in INTEM, EXTEM and FIBTEM ( p < 0.001 in all comparisons). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy.

However, the individual responsiveness of intracranial pressure (ICP) to PEEP varies. Thus, identifying an indicator detecting ICP responsiveness to PEEP is of great significance. As central venous pressure (CVP) could act as an intermediary to transduce pressure from PEEP to ICP, we developed a new indicator, P(IC)Gap, representing the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationship between P(IC)Gap and ICP responsiveness to PEEP. METHODS: A total of 112 patients with sTBI undergoing MV were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. ICP, CVP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), static compliance of the respiratory system (Cst), and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PetCO(2)) were recorded at the initial (3 cmH(2)O) and adjusted (15 cmH(2)O) levels of PEEP. P(IC)Gap was assessed as baseline ICP - baseline CVP (when PEEP = 3 cmH(2)O). The patients were classified into the ICP responder and non-responder groups based on whether ICP increment with PEEP adjusted from 3 cmH(2)O to 15 cmH(2)O was greater than 20% of baseline ICP. The above parameters were compared between the two groups, and prediction of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the non-responder group, the responder group had lower P(IC)Gap (1.63  1.33 versus 6.56  2.46 mmHg; p < 0.001), lower baseline ICP, and higher baseline CVP. ROC curve analysis suggested that P(IC)Gap was a stronger predictive indicator of ICP responsiveness to PEEP (AUC = 0.957, 95%CI 0.918C0.996; p < 0.001) compared with baseline ICP and baseline CVP, with favorable sensitivity (95.24, 95%CI 86.91C98.70%) and specificity (87.6, 95%CI 75.76C94.27%), at a cut off value of 2.5 mmHg. CONCLUSION: The impact of PEEP on ICP depends on the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP, i.e. P(IC)Gap.

This literature review aims to explore and describe the updated information about COVID-19 associated with pulmonary aspergillosis. We found that Aspergillus spp. can cause co-infections in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe/critical illness. The incidence of IPA in COVID-19 ranged from 19.6% to 33.3%. Acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation was the common complications, and the overall mortality was high, which could be up to 64.7% (n =22) in the pooled analysis of 34 reported cases. The conventional risk factors of invasive aspergillosis were not common among these specific populations. Fungus culture and galactomannan test, especially from respiratory specimens could help early diagnosis. A. fumigatus was the most common species causing co-infection in COVID-19 patients, followed by A. flavus. Although voriconazole is the recommended anti-Aspergillus agent and also the most commonly used antifungal agent, aspergillosis caused by azole-resistant Aspergillus is also possible. Additionally, voriconazole should be used carefully in the concern of complicated drug-drug interaction and enhancing cardiovascular toxicity on anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Finally, this review suggests that clinicians should keep alerting the possible occurrence of pulmonary aspergillosis in severe/critical COVID-19 patients, and aggressively microbiologic study in addition to SARS-CoV-2 via respiratory specimens should be indicated.","output":"COVID-19 associated with pulmonary aspergillosis: A literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Improved survival and intensified treatment protocols in pediatric oncology have resulted in an increased need for intensive care. However, in resource-constrained settings, the higher morbidity and mortality of these patients raises sensitive issues around the optimal use of limited critical care resources. METHODS Single-center, 10-year retrospective review of pediatric oncology patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). RESULTS Of the 117 admissions, 70.1% had solid tumors, 61.5% were admitted electively, and 76.1% were admitted for noninfective indications. PICU mortality of oncology patients was 18.8% relative to the PICU mortality of all patients in the same period of 10.5%. In a multivariable analysis, factors shown to be independently associated with PICU mortality were infective indications for admission (relative risk=3.83, confidence interval: 1.16; 12.6, P=0.028) and vasoactive support (relative risk=7.50, confidence interval: 1.72; 32.8, P=0.0074).

However, AIS has not been described as a late sequelae in patients without respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. Objective: To assess AIS experienced by adults 50 years or younger in the convalescent phase of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series prospectively identified consecutive male patients who received care for AIS from public health hospitals in Singapore between May 21, 2020, and October 14, 2020. All of these patients had laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 serological (antibodies) test result. These patients were individuals from South Asian countries (India and Bangladesh) who were working in Singapore and living in dormitories. The total number of COVID-19 cases (54 485) in the worker dormitory population was the population at risk. Patients with ongoing respiratory symptoms or positive SARS-CoV-2 serological test results confirmed through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swabs were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical course, imaging, and laboratory findings were retrieved from the electronic medical records of each participating hospital. The incidence rate of AIS in the case series was compared with that of a historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched national cohort. Results: A total of 18 male patients, with a median (range) age of 41 (35-50) years and South Asian ethnicity, were included. The median (range) time from a positive serological test result to AIS was 54.5 (0-130) days. The median (range) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 5 (1-25). Ten patients (56%) presented with a large vessel occlusion, of whom 6 patients underwent intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular therapy. Only 3 patients (17%) had a possible cardiac source of embolus. The estimated annual incidence rate of AIS was 82.6 cases per 100a?000 people in this study compared with 38.2 cases per 100a?000 people in the historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched cohort (rate ratio, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.36-3.48; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This case series suggests that the risk for AIS is higher in adults 50 years or younger during the convalescent period of a COVID-19 infection without respiratory symptoms. Acute ischemic stroke could be part of the next wave of complications of COVID-19, and stroke units should be on alert and use serological testing, especially in younger patients or in the absence of traditional risk factors.","output":"Acute Ischemic Stroke During the Convalescent Phase of Asymptomatic COVID-2019 Infection in Men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several fungi classified in the genus Tilletia are well-known to infect grass species including wheat (Triticum). Tilletia indica is a highly unwanted wheat pathogen causing Karnal bunt, subject to quarantine regulations in many countries.

Molecular biology advances have brought numerous detection tools to discriminate Tilletia congeners (PCR, qPCR, etc.). While those tests may help to identify T. indica more rapidly, they share weaknesses of targeting insufficiently variable markers or lacking sensitivity in a zero-tolerance context. A recent approach used comparative genomics to identify unique regions within target species, and qPCR assays were designed in silico. This study validated four qPCR tests based on single-copy genomic regions and with highly sensitive limits of detection (~200 fg), two to detect T. indica and T. walkeri separately, and two newly designed, targeting both species as a complex.

Two independent reviewers identified studies involving adults (age  18 years) with non-purulent SSTIs in which antimicrobial treatment failure was a defined outcome. There were no language restrictions. Only randomized trials or observational studies were included. RESULTS After screening 4953 abstracts, 26 studies (N = 6629 patients) met full inclusion criteria. Reported treatment failure ranged from 0 to 29.5%. The most common definition components were hospital admission (78.9%), change in antibiotics (65.4%), and persistent or worsening signs and symptoms of infection (34.6%). Only one study listed specific criteria for persistent or worsening signs and symptoms of infection. CONCLUSIONS For studies involving non-purulent SSTIs, the outcome of treatment failure is inconsistently defined and reported failure rates are highly variable.

To address the capability of each position of a codon to have non-synonymous mutations, the concept of degree of mutation has been introduced. The degree of mutation of a particular position of codon defines the number of non-synonymous mutations occurring for the substitution of nucleotides at each position of a codon, when other two positions of that codon remain unaltered. A Cellular Automaton (CA), is used as a tool to model the mutations of any one of the four DNA bases A, C, T and G at a time where the DNA bases correspond to the states of the CA cells. Point mutation (substitution type) of a codon which characterizes changes in the amino acids, have been associated with local transition rules of a CA. Though there can be transitions of a 4-state CA with 3-neighbourhood cells, here it has been possible to represent all possible point mutations of a codon in terms of combinations of 16 local transition functions of the CA. Further these rules are divided into 4 classes of equivalence. Also, according to the nature of mutations, the 16 local CA rules of substitutions are classified into 3 sets namely, No Mutation, Transition and Transversion. The experiment has been carried out with three sets of single nucleotide variations(SNVs) of three different viruses but the symptoms of the diseases caused by them are to some extent similar to each other.

The latter incorporated positive cooperative interactions, resulting from preferred and multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent surface, as well as negative cooperative interactions attributed to exclusion effects due to size exclusion and repulsion. Cooperative adsorption resulted in negative or positive deviations from the Langmuir model for both single and multicomponent isotherms. The model was used to assess possible contributions of different adsorption mechanisms of proteins and their structurally different forms to the overall adsorption pattern, as well as to simulate chromatographic band profiles under different loading conditions. For proteins with unstable structure, the overall adsorption isotherm was dominated by binding of unfolded species at low surface coverage and by positive cooperative adsorption at high surface coverage. Furthermore, regardless of structural stability, exclusion effects influenced strongly adsorption equilibrium, particularly at low surface coverages.

Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic. MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11 766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. Sixty-three healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N-specific antibodies, S1-specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody.

However, despite strong cross-reactivity of convalescent antisera between related arenavirus species, weak or no cross-neutralization occurs. Two closely related clade B viruses, Machupo virus (MACV) and Junn virus (JUNV), have nearly identical overall GPC architecture and share a host receptor, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Given structural and functional similarities of the GP1 receptor binding site (RBS) of these viruses and the recent demonstration that the RBS is an important target for neutralizing antibodies, it is not clear how these viruses avoid cross-neutralization. To address this, MACV/JUNV chimeric GPCs were assessed for interaction with a group of -JUNV GPC monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and mouse antisera against JUNV or MACV GPC. All six MAbs targeted GP1, with those that neutralized JUNV GPC-pseudovirions competing with each other for RBS binding. However, these MAbs were unable to bind to a chimeric GPC composed of JUNV GP1 containing a small disulfide bonded loop (loop 10) unique to MACV GPC, suggesting that this loop may block MAbs interaction with the GP1 RBS. Consistent with this loop causing interference, mouse anti-JUNV GPC antisera that solely neutralized pseudovirions bearing autologous GP1 provided enhanced neutralization of MACV GPC when this loop was removed. Our studies provide evidence that loop 10, which is unique to MACV GP1, is an important impediment to binding of neutralizing antibodies and contributes to the poor cross-neutralization of -JUNV antisera against MACV.IMPORTANCE Multiple New World arenaviruses can cause severe disease in humans, and some geographic overlap exists among these viruses.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the diagnosis, treatment, and consultation methods for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a survey among 27 hospitals from 14 Asia-Pacific countries, collecting hospital-level information on the number of newly diagnosed HCC cases during a pre-pandemic period (February to May 2019) and for the same period during the pandemic (February to May 2020). Information was also collected on delays in diagnosis and treatment, changes in treatment modalities and complication rates, changes in patient enrollment in clinical trials, and modes of patient consultation. The information was stratified by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. RESULTS: The survey included cohorts of 2789 and 2045 patients newly diagnosed with HCC during the pre- and pandemic period, respectively. A decline of 26.7% in new HCC cases was reported during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic. A sizable proportion of institutions reported delays in diagnosis (48.2% in BCLC 0/A/B and 51.9% in BCLC C), delays in treatment (66.7% in BCLC 0/A/B and 63.0% in BCLC C), changes in treatment modality (33.3% in BCLC 0/A/B and 18.5% in BCLC C), an increase in treatment complications (about 15% across all BCLC stages), and no growth in clinical trial enrollments during the pandemic. Furthermore, there was a decline of 27.3% in face-to-face patient consultations and an increase of 18.3% in video/telephonic consultations during the pandemic. A considerable variation in changes in HCC management was observed among countries. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the management of HCC among Asia-Pacific countries. The impact varies according to the disease stage and country. Well thought-through long-term strategies are required to ameliorate the negative impact of the pandemic on HCC patients.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Hepatocellular Carcinoma Management: A Multicountry and Region Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In India, very first infection due to Covid-19 was reported by end of January 2020 and, the same has been increased with the span of time.

METHOD: Serum IL6 of 144 controls were compared to 52 samples from patients with COVID-like respiratory symptoms (17 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive); 25 of these were from the intensive care unit (ICU). We compared the IL6 levels to C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels in all cases. RESULTS: The IL6 assay had coefficient-of-variation (CV) of 2.3% (34.1 pg/mL) and 2.5% (222.5 pg/mL), a limit of quantitation <1.6 pg/mL, and was linear from 1.6-4948pg/mL. There was a significant difference in IL6 values between patients with COVID-like respiratory symptoms versus controls (p < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that IL6 > 6.4 pg/mL identified symptomatic cases (AUC 0.94, sensitivity 88.2%, specificity 97.2%). There was a significant difference between the IL6 of symptomatic ICU/non-ICU cases (median IL6 228 vs 11 pg/mL, p < 0.0001); ROC analysis showed IL6 > 75 pg/mL (sensitivity 76.0%, specificity 88.9%) was superior to CRP and PCT in predicting ICU admission (AUC: IL6 0.83, CRP 0.71, PCT 0.82). CONCLUSION: The performance of Elecsys IL6 assay is in keeping with the manufacturers claims. IL6 > 6.4 pg/mL differentiates healthy from suspected COVID-19 cases and appears to be raised earlier than the other inflammatory markers in some cases.

The widespread use of these devices and the long-term nature of the recorded data provides a valuable source of physical activity data for epidemiological research. The challenges include the large heterogeneity between activity tracker models in terms of available data types, the accuracy of recorded data, and how this data can be shared between different providers and third-party systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a system to record data on physical activity from different providers of consumer-based activity trackers and to examine its usability as a tool for physical activity monitoring in epidemiological research. The longitudinal nature of the data and the concurrent pandemic outbreak allowed us to show how the system can be used for surveillance of physical activity levels before, during, and after a COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We developed a system (mSpider) for automatic recording of data on physical activity from participants wearing activity trackers from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Polar, Samsung, and Withings, as well as trackers storing data in Google Fit and Apple Health. To test the system throughout development, we recruited 35 volunteers to wear a provided activity tracker from early 2019 and onward. In addition, we recruited 113 participants with privately owned activity trackers worn before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Norway. We examined monthly changes in the number of steps, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and activity energy expenditure between 2019 and 2020 using bar plots and two-sided paired sample t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared to March 2019, there was a significant reduction in mean step count and mean activity energy expenditure during the March 2020 lockdown period. The reduction in steps and activity energy expenditure was temporary, and the following monthly comparisons showed no significant change between 2019 and 2020. A small significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was observed for several monthly comparisons after the lockdown period and when comparing March-December 2019 with March-December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: mSpider is a working prototype currently able to record physical activity data from providers of consumer-based activity trackers.

Aims: This trial aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PrEP with various doses of HCQ against a placebo among high-risk healthcare providers (HCPs). Methods: A phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. A total of 228 HCPs were screened, we included 200 subjects with no active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects of experimental groups 1-3 received HCQ in various doses and those in the control group received placebo. The study outcomes in terms of safety and efficacy were monitored. Participants exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study and also by the end of the 12th week, with PCR or IgM and IgG serology. Results: Overall, 146 of 200 participants reported exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case in the first month, 189 in the 2nd month and 192 were exposed by the 12th week of the study. Moreover, the precautionary practices, i.e. use of personal protective equipment (PPE), significantly varied; initially more than 80% of the exposed HCPs weren't ensuring the PPE used by the patients treated by them. However, it gradually developed with the increasing knowledge of the virus. As far as safety is concerned, mild treatment-related side effects were observed among the interventional and placebo arm patients. While none of the participants were critical, and a few had mild illness by the end of the 12th week, requiring only outpatient observation with no hospitalization. There was no significant clinical benefit of PrEP with HCQ as compared to placebo (p>0.05). Conclusion: It is concluded from the study findings that the PrEP HCQ does not significantly prevent illness compatible with COVID-19 or confirmed infection among high-risk HCPs.","output":"Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis with Various Doses of Hdroxychloroquine among high-risk COVID 19 Healthcare Personnel: CHEER randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3'-Deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine triphosphate (ddhCTP) is a novel antiviral molecule produced by the enzyme viperin as part of the innate immune response. ddhCTP has been shown to act as an obligate chain terminator of flavivirus and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases; however, further biophysical studies have been precluded by limited access to this promising antiviral.

A 33-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a one-week history of cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia, with no other significant past medical history. She tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently, her respiratory function rapidly deteriorated, necessitating endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. She had severe hypoxic respiratory failure requiring a protracted period on the mechanical ventilator with different ventilation strategies and multiple cycles of prone positioning. During her proning, after two weeks on the intensive care unit, she developed tension pneumothorax that required bilateral intercostal chest drains (ICD) to stabilise her. After 24 days, she had a percutaneous tracheostomy and began her respiratory wean; however, this was limited due to the ongoing infection. Thorax CT demonstrated a left-sided pneumothorax, with bilateral pneumatoceles and a sizeable, complex hydropneumothorax. Despite the insertion of ICDs, the hydropneumothorax persisted over months and initially progressed in size on serial scans needing multiple ICDs. She was too ill for surgical interventions initially, opting for conservative management. After 60 days, she successfully underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for a washout and placement of further ICDs. She was successfully decannulated after 109 days on the intensive care unit and was discharged to a rehabilitation unit after 116 days of being an inpatient, with her last thorax CT showing some residual pneumatoceles but significant improvement.

The purpose is twofold: (1) present a global programme C Cities COVID Mitigation Mapping (C2M2) programme C focusing on urban areas that explores second-order impacts through the use of geospatial tools and technologies, and (2) identify and assess the emerging literature on second-order impacts using geospatial data and analysis to support this project. Effects of the pandemic are rapidly unfolding across the world;however, an assessment of the literature reveals that second-order impacts of COVID-19 are seasonal, spatial, and scalar across multiple thematic areas includ-ing the economy, environmental health sector, education, and migration/mobility. Successive waves of the pandemic are continuing to be met with specific public health measures (e.g. lockdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing guidance, mandates for the use of personal protective equipment) that will have long-term impacts on vulnerable populations. A literature review was conducted to identify how the pandemics second-order impacts derived from geospatial data and analysis can provide the basis for using geospatial data to study vulnerable urban populations more generally. This review reveals a gap in the literature, with far more articles emphasizing geospatial approaches to assess first-order impacts and alimited number of articles focused on geospatial approaches investigating second-order impacts. Nonetheless, this nascent literature provides the basis for designing approaches with local partners and by local and regional governments to apply geospatial data and methodologies to the development of mitigation strategies to prioritize limited resources to minimize the long-term consequences of COVID-19.

The review aimed to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence, process, and outcomes of OHCA. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and pre-print websites was performed. Studies reporting comparative data on OHCA within the same jurisdiction, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Study quality was assessed based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Ten studies reporting data from 35,379 OHCA events were included. There was a 120% increase in OHCA events since the pandemic. Time from OHCA to ambulance arrival was longer during the pandemic (pa?=a?0.036). While mortality (ORa?=a?0.67, 95%-CI 0.49-0.91) and supraglottic airway use (ORa?=a?0.36, 95%-CI 0.27-0.46) was higher during the pandemic, automated external defibrillator use (ORa?=a?1.78 95%-CI 1.06-2.98), return of spontaneous circulation (ORa?=a?1.63, 95%CI 1.18-2.26) and intubation (ORa?=a?1.87, 95%-CI 1.12--3.13) was more common before the pandemic. More patients survived to hospital admission (ORa?=a?1.75, 95%-CI 1.42-2.17) and discharge (ORa?=a?1.65, 95%-CI 1.28-2.12) before the pandemic.

As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the human body through the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the gastrointestinal tract, the mechanism underlying the gastrointestinal symptoms may involve damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotion of the production of inflammatory factors. Indeed, after cells in the lungs become infected by SARS-CoV-2, effector CD4(+) T cells reach the small intestine through the gut-lung axis, causing intestinal immune damage and diarrhea; early extensive use of antibacterial and antiviral drugs can also lead to diarrhea in patients. Thus, treatment options for COVID-19 patients should be promptly adjusted when they have gastrointestinal symptoms.

The typical modeling rationale of estimating network capacity is to formulate it as a mathematical programming (MP), and there are two main approaches: single-level MP formulation and bi-level programming (BLP) formulation. Although single-level MP is readily solvable, it treats the transportation network as a physical network without considering level of service (LOS). Albeit BLP explicitly models the capacity and link LOS, solving BLP in large-scale networks is challenging due to its non-convexity. Moreover, the inconsideration of trip LOS makes the existing models difficult to differentiate network capacity under various traffic states and to capture the impact of emerging trip-oriented technologies. Therefore, this paper proposes the -max capacity model to estimate the maximum network capacity under trip or OCD LOS requirement . The proposed model improves the existing models on three aspects: (a) it considers trip LOS, which can flexibly estimate the network capacity ranging from zero to the physical capacity including reserve, practical and ultimate capacities; (b) trip LOS can intuitively reflect users maximum acceptable OCD travel time or planners requirement of OCD travel time; and (c) it is a convex and tractable single-level MP. For practical use, we develop a modified gradient projection solution algorithm with soft constraint technique, and provide methods to obtain discrete trip LOS and network capacity under representative traffic states.

In multiview cameras, accurately detecting different types of guns and knives and classifying them from other video surveillance objects in real-time scenarios is difficult. Most detecting cameras are resource-constrained devices with limited computational capacities. To mitigate this problem, we proposed a resource-constrained lightweight subclass detection method based on a convolutional neural network to classify, locate, and detect different types of guns and knives effectively and efficiently in a real-time environment.

The present study, therefore, aimed to extend existing knowledge on chronic parenting stress by 1) testing for the mediational role of couple dissatisfaction in explaining the link from IPV victimization to PB as well as the link from IPV victimization to dysfunctional parenting, and 2) investigating how specialist gender roles and parental responsibilities for child care relate to IPV victimization and PB. Data collection was part of an international collaboration on factors related to parental satisfaction and exhaustion across different countries. Self-report data from Austrian mothers (N = 121) were collected online and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results indicated that couple dissatisfaction mediates the link from IPV victimization to PB, as well as IPV victimization to dysfunctional parenting. Furthermore, only specialist gender roles were significantly related to IPV, while parental responsibilities for child care did not significantly relate to experiences of violence. Additionally, neither specialist gender roles nor parental responsibilities were significantly associated with PB in the final model.

The study's immediate result was to assess the combined prevalence of otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. However, the secondary result was to determine the exacerbation of COVID-19 infection in patients with otorhinolaryngological symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies with 16,478 patients were included. Olfactory dysfunction, sneezing and sputum production were the 3 most prevalent otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence amongst the prevalent symptoms was 47% (95% CI 29-65; range 0-98; I2 = 99.58%), 27% (95% CI 11-48; range 12-40; I2 = 93.34%), and 22% (95% CI 16-30; range 2-56; I2 = 97.60%), respectively. The proportion of severely ill patients with sputum production and shortness of breath was significantly higher among patients with COVID-19 infections (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.08-2.54]; P = 0.02, I2 = 51% and 3.29 [95% CI 1.57-6.90]; P = 0.002, I2 = 49%, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the incidence of otolaryngology symptoms in severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients (OR 1.43 [95% CI 1.12-1.82]; P = 0.07 I2 = 53.1%). In contrast, the incidence of shortness of breath in severely ill patients was significantly increased (3.29 [1.57-6.90]; P = 0.002, I2 = 49%). CONCLUSION: Our research shows that otorhinolaryngology symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are not uncommon, which should attract otorhinolaryngologists' attention.","output":"Prevalence and prognosis of otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Art Refuge uses art and art therapy to support the mental health and well-being of people displaced due to conflict, persecution and poverty, both in the UK and internationally Learning from its frontline programme in northern France has helped to inform the charity's response to Covid19 Context: Social media and online communication are often lifelines for people who are displaced Since March 2020, Art Refuge has extended its use of online platforms Approach: Focusing on grounding techniques developed from the principles of Psychological First Aid, alongside the theme of daily rituals, the online work has used trauma-informed approaches to create viable spaces for social engagement alongside physical spaces: both require careful thinking to build safe, adaptive psychosocial structures, appropriate to context Outcomes: These online models have limitations but also benefits: sustaining spaces in which individuals can find connection;developing new relationships while encouraging others;reaching people from a wide geographic area and across borders;partnership working which supports sustainability Conclusions: As a result of Covid19, Art Refuge has developed new models for social engagement which include integration of both online and face-to-face models The authors propose that these have relevance in both an emergency context and for wider application Implications for research: Technological inequalities and issues of access need research, alongside robust evaluation studies on each model and research into whether these models can be usefully applied to other areas of practice Plain-language summary Art Refuge uses art and art therapy to support the mental health and well-being of people displaced due to conflict, persecution and poverty, both in the UK and internationally Our work in northern France since 2015 has included direct face-to-face models and using social media to engage people, delivered by a team of experienced art therapists and visual artists The use of social media and online communication are often lifelines for staying in touch with family, friends and communities, alongside access to information and support, and Art Refuge has responded by being active online Since Covid19, the charity has begun to see online work as having creative potential for social engagement, alongside working with people face-to-face Both need careful thought as to how to build structures which are adaptive and appropriate to context, safe and accessible This article focuses on how to create specific online models for social engagement, and the thinking and ethics behind these This includes using grounding techniques developed from the principles of Psychological First Aid, alongside the theme of daily rituals The work online has opened up possibilities: reaching people from different geographic places and across country borders;and working with individuals within other organisations which enables skills sharing so that the work can be continued when the team is not there Adaptations to art therapy practice and traditional materials are necessary, as are the right devices and connectivity In conclusion, Art Refuge has found that there are imaginative and engaging ways of working online, particularly when integrated with face-to-face delivery Technological inequalities and issues of access need research, alongside robust evaluation studies on each model and research into whether these models can be usefully applied to other areas of practice","output":"Lifeline, frontline, online: adapting art therapy for social engagement across borders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT In Brazil, indigenous peoples present a complex reality characterized by a marked social vulnerability that is manifested in health and nutritional indicators. In this scenario, poor sanitary conditions prevail, with a high burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases; infectious/parasitic diseases; and nutritional disorders, including malnutrition and anemia. This situation is reflected in numerous aspects of food insecurity, placing this population in a position of particular vulnerability to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and its effects. The objective of our study was to present a set of preliminary reflections on food insecurity and indigenous protagonism in times of Covid-19. The pandemic has deepened the inequalities that affect the indigenous peoples, with a direct impact on food security conditions.

This paper reports on a novel technique that involves endoscopic ultrasound(EUS)-guided access into the remnant stomach and sutured gastropexy for transgastric ERCP in a single combined session. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 10 patients with RYGB underwent transgastric ERCP using the novel technique. EUS was used to puncture the excluded stomach through the gastric pouch or jejunum,the stomach was insufflated, and a direct percutaneous gastrostomy puncture followed by sutured gastropexy was performed. ERCP was performed by passing a duodenoscope through the gastrostomy. RESULTS Technical success of EUS-assisted sutured gastropexy was achieved in nine patients (90 %),with immediate, same-session ERCP in all nine.There were no adverse events.

In Englands National Health Service, the waiting list has grown from 4.4 million in February 2020 to 5.7m by August 2021. AimsThe objective of this study was to estimate the trajectory of future waiting list size and waiting times to December 2025. MethodsA scenario analysis was performed using computer simulation and publicly available data as of November 2021. Future demand assumed a phased return of various proportions (0, 25, 50 and 75%) of the estimated 7.1 million referrals missed during the pandemic. Future capacity assumed 90, 100 and 110% of that provided in the 12 months immediately before the pandemic. ResultsAs a worst case, the waiting list would reach 13.6m (95% CI: 12.4m to 15.6m) by Autumn 2022, if 75% of missed referrals returned and only 90% of pre pandemic capacity could be achieved. Under this scenario, the proportion of patients waiting under 18 weeks would reduce from 67.6% in August 2021 to 42.2% (37.4% to 46.2%) with the number waiting over 52 weeks reaching 1.6m (0.8m to 3.1m) by Summer 2023. At this time, 29.0% (21.3% to 36.8%) of patients would be leaving the waiting list before treatment. Waiting lists would remain pressured under even the most optimistic of scenarios considered, with 18-week performance struggling to maintain 60% (against the 92% constitutional target).

Breast cancer is the most common cancer internationally. Breast cancer is a disease that involves surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy, and, more recently, immunotherapy in its management plan. The immune system requires months to recover from these medications, and this condition is even worse in patients with metastatic breast cancer who need ongoing treatment with these drugs. Some of these drugs, such as inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, can cause rare but life-threating lung inflammation. Patients with breast cancer who have metastatic disease to the lungs can experience deterioration of disease symptoms with COVID-19 infection. Oncologists treating patients with breast cancer are facing a difficult situation regarding treatment choice. The impact that COVID-19 has had on breast cancer care is unknown, including how to provide the best care possible without compromising patient and community safety. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the views of oncologists regarding the management of patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based SurveyMonkey questionnaire was submitted to licensed oncologists involved in breast cancer management in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and United Arab Emirates. The survey focused on characteristics of the participants, infection risk among patients with cancer, and possible treatment modifications related to different types of breast cancer. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 82 participants. For early hormone receptor (HR)Cpositive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)Cnegative breast cancer, 61 of the 82 participants (74%) supported using neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in selected patients, and 58% (48/82) preferred giving 6 over 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy when indicated. Only 43% (35/82) preferred inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 with hormonal therapy as the first-line treatment in all patients with metastatic HR-positive disease. A total of 55 of the 82 participants (67%) supported using adjuvant trastuzumab for 6 instead of 12 months in selected patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. For metastatic HER2-positive, HR-positive breast cancer, 80% of participants (66/82) supported the use of hormonal therapy with dual anti-HER2 blockade in selected patients. The preferred choice of first-line treatment in metastatic triple negative patients with BRCA mutation and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) <1% was poly(adenosine diphosphateCribose) polymerase inhibitor according to 41% (34/82) of the participants, and atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel was preferred for PD-L1 >1% according to 71% (58/82) of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Several modifications in breast cancer management were supported by the survey participants.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 15 April 2020, together with the German Society of Pathology and the Federal Association of German Pathologists, the German Registry of COVID-19 Autopsies (DeRegCOVID) was launched (www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de). Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers. The rights to own data and biomaterials (stored decentrally) remain with each respective center. The DEFEAT PANDEMIcs network expands on this and aims to strengthen harmonization and standardization as well as nationwide implementation and cooperation in the field of pandemic autopsies. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary cooperation in the field of autopsies in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic is impressively demonstrated by the establishment of DeRegCOVID, the merger of the registry of neuropathology (CNS-COVID19) with DeRegCOVID and the establishment of the autopsy network DEFEAT PANDEMIcs. It gives a strong signal for the necessity, readiness, and expertise to jointly help manage current and future pandemics by autopsy-derived knowledge.","output":"Kooperatives Vorgehen der Pathologie und Neuropathologie in der COVID-19-Pandemie: Deutsches Register fr COVID-19-Obduktionen (DeRegCOVID) und Deutsches Netzwerk fr Autopsien in Pandemien (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent mosquito-borne member of the Flaviviridae family that was responsible for a recent epidemic in the Americas.

The concept was adopted in other hospitals and published as a case series. This is the first prospectively controlled randomized study comparing DCS and conventional treatment (Group C) in this setting. METHODS: All consecutive patients from 2013 to 2018 with indication for surgery were screened and randomized to Group DCS or Group C. The primary outcome was the rate of reconstructed bowel at discharge and at 6 month. Informed consent was obtained. The trial was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at CinicalTrials.gov: NCT04034407. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were screened; 41 patients gave informed consent to participate and ultimately 21 patients (9 female) with intraoperatively confirmed Hinchey III (n = 14, 67%) or IV (n = 7, 33%), and a median (range) age of 66 (42-92), Mannheim Peritonitis Index of 25 (12-37) and Charlson Comorbidity Index of 3 (0-10) were intraoperatively randomized and treated as Group DCS (n = 13) or Group C (n = 8). Per protocol analysis: A primary anastomosis without ileostomy (PA) was performed in 92% (11/12) patients in Group DCS at the second-look operation, one patient died before second look, and one underwent a Hartmann procedure (HP). In Group C 63% (5/8) patients received a PA and 38% (3/8) patients a HP. Two patients in Group C, but none in Group DCS experienced anastomotic leakage (AI). ICU and hospital stay was median (range) 2 (1-10) and 17.5 (12-43) in DCS and 2 (1-62) and 22 (13-65) days in group C. In Group DCS 8% (1/12) patients was discharged with a stoma versus 57% (4/7) in Group C (p = 0.038, n.s., &#945; = 0.025); one patient died before discharge. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for discharge with a stoma is 0.068 (0.005-0.861). Intent to treat analysis: A PA was performed in 90% (9/10) of patients randomized to DCS, one patient died before the second look, and one patient received a HP. In group C, 70% (7/10) were treated with PA and 30% (3/10) with HP. 29% (2/7) experienced AI treated with protective ileostomy. In group DCS, 9% (1/11) were discharged with a stoma versus 40% (4/10) in group C (p = 0.14, n.s.). The odds ratio for discharge with a stoma is 0.139 (0.012-1.608).

However, the therapeutic effects of B. subtilis-fermented milk on IBD remain to be explored. In this research, the therapeutic effect of B. subtilis-fermented milk on dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced IBD mouse model was evaluated. Besides, the expression of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, the proliferation of the intestinal stem cells, and the reconstruction of the mucosa barrier were investigated.

As shown by the results, the disease activity index (DAI) of IBD was significantly decreased through oral administration of B. subtilis (JNFE0126)-fermented milk, and intestinal mucosa injury was attenuated. Moreover, B. subtilis could reduce the inflammatory response of the intestinal mucosa, induce proliferation of the intestinal stem cell, and promote reconstruction of the mucosal barrier. Furthermore, B. subtilis could rebalance the intestinal flora, increasing the abundance of Bacillus, Alistipes, and Lactobacillus while decreasing the abundance of Escherichia and Bacteroides.

In particular, we focus on the importance of community-based learning in raising environmental awareness and inspiring action to support healthy living and harmony with nature. The three groups were triangulated using semi-structured questionnaires to model the ways in which education for sustainable development (ESD) can contribute to the promotion of environmental education in local communities. In order to collect in-depth data, the authors themselves were present at the study sites and collected textual data based on semi-structured questionnaires in a participatory observation framework, where they had a common experience to understand the observations. Analysis was carried out using NVivo12. The two community learning initiatives studied were in Okayama and Tokyo, which are leading ESD policy areas. The two case studies are both university student-led projects that aim to raise environmental awareness in local communities through environmentally conscious behaviour change and the creation of a foundation for healthy living. This study focuses on youth and community among the five priority areas proposed in the 2015 ESD report and discusses the potential and prospects for community learning initiatives and the triggering of the nudge effect on environmentally conscious behaviour change and health behaviours. The results of the textual analysis with triangulation show that, while policymakers and teachers and leaders driving the initiative acknowledge the importance of ESD in a comprehensive way, their attention is more focused on the design of specific projects and curricula. In contrast, university students engaged in ESD activities rated the social education facilities (local community centres, community learning centres) as lively and motivating.

And gut microbiota richness was not restored to normal levels after 6-month recovery. However, SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, few studies investigate whether the alterations of oropharyngeal microbiome is associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19, and whether interferences in microbiome composition, if any, eliminate with clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We employed metatranscriptomic sequencing to analyse oropharyngeal swabs collected within a week of diagnosis COVID-19 (period of disease group: PDG) and two months after clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (convalescent group: CG) from 47 patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, oropharyngeal swabs from 40 healthy subjects were analyzed as healthy control group (HCG). Results: : Oropharyngeal microbial composition was significantly altered in patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls even two months after clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Little changes in -diversity among HCG, PDG and CG ( P 0.05), but obviously changes in -diversity among them. Notably, Prevotella increased significantly in PDG than that in HCG (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P 0.001) and increased gradually along with the severity of patients with COVID-19 aggravated. There was a positive correlation between Prevotella and the elevation of Neutrophil percentage (R = 0.301, P = 0.040).

Exposure to particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10), O3 and NO2 during late stages of spermatogenesis appeared to have weak but positive association with semen quality. Exposure to CO late in sperm development appeared to have inverse relationship with sperm movement parameters. Exposure to SO2 appeared to influence semen quality throughout spermatogenesis. CONCLUSION(S): Potential windows of susceptibility for semen quality varied depending on air pollutants. Sperm motility was sensitive to pollution exposure. Findings from current study further elucidate the importance of sensitive periods during spermatogenesis and provide new evidence for the determinants of male fertility.","output":"Semen quality and windows of susceptibility: A case study during COVID-19 outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bad advice can lead to tragedy, such as death from taking an unproven medication.1 Now, more than ever, public health policies should be based on the best available evidence.

Eighty-eight participants performed face recognition with masked faces either during learning only, during recognition only, or during both learning and recognition. As compared with the baseline condition where faces were unmasked during both learning and recognition, participants had impaired performance in all three scenarios, with larger impairment when mask conditions during learning and recognition did not match. When recognizing unmasked faces, whether the faces were learned with or without a mask on did not change eye movement behavior. Nevertheless, when recognizing unmasked faces that were learned with a mask on, participants who adopted more eyes-focused patterns had less performance impairment as compared with the baseline condition. When recognizing masked faces, participants had more eyes-focused patterns and more consistent gaze transition behavior than recognizing unmasked faces regardless of whether the faces were learned with or without a mask on. Nevertheless, when recognizing masked faces that were learned without a mask, participants whose gaze transition behavior was more consistent had less performance impairment as compared with the baseline condition. Thus, although eye movements during recognition were mainly driven by the mask condition during recognition but not that during learning, those who adjusted their strategy according to the mask condition difference between learning and recognition had better performance.

Front-line healthcare providers are key for the early identification and management of the unwell woman who may have infection. We sought to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of the use of screening tools to detect infectious maternal morbidity during and after pregnancy as part of routine antenatal and postnatal care. Enabling factors, barriers, and potential management options for the use of early warning scores were explored. METHODS: Key informant interviews (n = 10) and two focus group discussions (n = 14) were conducted with healthcare providers and managers (total = 24) working in one large tertiary public hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Transcribed interviews were coded by topic and then grouped into categories. Thematic framework analysis was undertaken to identify emerging themes. RESULTS: Most healthcare providers are aware of the importance of the early detection of infection and would seek to better identify women with infection if resources were available to do so. In current practice, an early warning score was used in the high dependency unit only. Routine screening was not in place in the antenatal or postnatal departments. Barriers to implementing routine screening included lack of trained staff and time, lack of thermometers, and difficulties with the interpretation of the early warning scores. A locally adapted early warning screening tool was considered an enabler to implementing routine screening for infectious morbidity. Local ownership and clinical leadership were considered essential for successful and sustainable implementation for clinical change. CONCLUSIONS: Although healthcare providers considered infection during and after pregnancy and childbirth a danger sign and significant morbidity, standardised screening for infectious maternal morbidity was not part of routine antenatal or postnatal care. The establishment of such a service requires the availability of free and easy to access rapid diagnostic testing, training in interpretation of results, as well as affordable targeted treatment. The implementation of early warning scores and processes developed in high-income countries need careful consideration and validation when applied to women accessing care in low resource settings.

Coagulopathy has been reported as associated with mortality in people with COVID-19 and is partially reflected by enhanced D-dimer levels. Poor vascular health, which is associated with the cardiometabolic health conditions frequently reported in people with severer forms of COVID-19, might exacerbate the risk of coagulopathy and mortality. Sedentary lifestyles might also contribute to the development of coagulopathy, and physical activity participation has been inherently lowered due to at-home regulations established to slow the spread of this highly infectious disease. It is possible that COVID-19, coagulation, and reduced physical activity may contribute to generate a perfect storm, where each fuels the other and potentially increases mortality risk. Several pharmaceutical agents are being explored to treat COVID-19, but potential negative consequences are associated with their use. Exercise is known to mitigate many of the identified side effects from the pharmaceutical agents being trialled but has not yet been considered as part of management for COVID-19. From the limited available evidence in people with cardiometabolic health conditions, low- to moderate-intensity exercise might have the potential to positively influence biochemical markers of coagulopathy, whereas high-intensity exercise is likely to increase thrombotic risk. Therefore, low- to moderate-intensity exercise could be an adjuvant therapy for people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and reduce the risk of developing severe symptoms of illness that are associated with enhanced mortality.","output":"Coronavirus (COVID-19), Coagulation, and Exercise: Interactions That May Influence Health Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Immunization with attenuated malaria sporozoites protects humans from experimental malaria challenge by mosquito bite.

Quantitative evaluation of serum antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides a means of monitoring a patient's immune response to a natural viral infection or vaccination, as well as evidence of a prior infection. In this paper, a portable and low-cost electrochemical immunosensor is developed for the rapid and accurate quantification of SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. The immunosensor is capable of quantifying the concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human serum. For IgG and IgM, it provides measurements in the range of 10.1 ng/mL ? 60 g/mL and 1.64 ng/mL ? 50 g/mL, respectively, and both antibodies can be assayed in 13 min. We also developed device stabilization and storage strategies to achieve stable performance of the immunosensor within 24-week storage at room temperature. We evaluated the performance of the immunosensor using COVID-19 patient serum samples collected at different time points after symptom onset.

Governments took the extraordinary step of locking down their own countries to curb the spread of the coronavirus. After weeks of severe restrictions, countries have begun to relax their strict lockdown measures. However, reopening will not be back to normal. Simulation facilities (SF) are training spaces that enable health professionals and students to learn skills and procedures in a safe and protected environment. Todays clinicians and students have an expectation that simulation laboratories are part of lifelong healthcare education. There is great uncertainty about how COVID-19 will impact future training in SF. In particular, the delivery of training activities will benefit of adequate safety measures implemented for all individuals involved. This paper discusses how to safely reopen SF in the post-lockdown phase. MAIN BODY: The paper outlines 10 focus points and provides operational tips and recommendations consistent with current international guidelines to reopen SF safely in the post-lockdown phase. Considering a variety of national advices and regulations which describe initial measures for the reopening of workplaces as well as international public health recommendations, we provide points of reflection that can guide decision-makers and SF leaders on how to develop local approaches to specific challenges. The tips have been laid out taking also into account two main factors: (a) the SF audience, mainly consisting of undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare professionals, who might face exposure to COVID-19 infection, and (b) for many simulation-based activities, such as teamwork training, adequate physical distancing cannot be maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The planning of future activities will have to be based not only on safety but also on flexibility principles. Sharing common methods consistent with national and international health guidelines, while taking into account the specific characteristics of the different contexts and centres, will ultimately foster dissemination of good practices.

Here we report a grinding exfoliation method that uses micro-particles as force intermediates to resolve applied compressive forces into a multitude of small shear forces, inducing the highly-efficient exfoliation of layer materials. The method, referred to as intermediate-assisted grinding exfoliation (iMAGE), can be used for the large-scale production of many 2D materials. As an example, we have exfoliated bulk h-BN into 2D h-BN with large flake sizes, high quality and structural integrity, with a high exfoliation yield of 67%, a high production rate of 0.3 g h-1 and a low energy consumption of 3.01x10^6 J g-1. The production rate and energy consumption are one to two orders of magnitude better than previous results.

Respondents sought greater communication and tailored advice from their care team, clear and consistent information from the government and news channels, and improved understanding of diabetes and its challenges from their personal networks and employers. Conclusion Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the mental health and wellbeing of people living with diabetes. Diabetes care teams must receive assistance to support these individuals without risking further inequalities in access to healthcare. Equipping personal networks and employers with knowledge on diabetes and skills to support self-management may reduce the burden on the NHS.","output":"Exploring support needs of people living with diabetes during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic: insights from a UK survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, there were over 300 000 health applications in the market and continues to grow Approximately 40 percent of smartphone owners use mHealth apps Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, the existence of mHealth become much more important But, approximately more than 30 percent mHealth applications were uninstalled within a month of download The impact of uninstalled app is quite significant both for users and company Uninstalled app can cause more than $30,000 monthly potential loss to the company Also, without using mHealth continuously users won't be able to achieve their ultimate goal, which is improving the quality of live An increasing amount of research has been conducted to learn about the continuance usage intention of mHealth, and we rarely find an extensive article review on mHealth continuance usage intention Therefore, this paper aim to identify factors affecting continuance usage intention of mHealth application using a systematic literature review approach to papers published in 2010-2020 According to the findings there are 39 factors that affecting continuance usage intention of mHealth application, with the most frequent factors are Satisfaction, Perceived usefulness, Perceived service quality, Perceived trust, and Perceived ease of use From that factors we can see that user will continuously use the app if the app can accommodate their expectation and satisfy them To achieve that, the app not only need to be easy to use but also must have a good service quality, and trustworthy ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Identification of Factor Affecting Continuance Usage Intention of mHealth Application : A Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accounts for over 180,000 deaths in the USA. Although COVID-19 affects all racial ethnicities, non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest mortality rates. Evidence continues to emerge, linking the disproportion of contagion and mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a result of adverse social determinants of health. Yet, genetic predisposition may also play a credible role in disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the receptor molecule angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on the surface of the target cells, such that polymorphisms and the expression level of ACE2 influence infectivity and consequent pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Genetic polymorphisms in other multiple genes, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and interleukin-6, are also closely associated with underlying diseases, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which substantially raise SARS-CoV-2 mortality. However, it is unknown how these genetic polymorphisms contribute to the disparate mortality rates, with or without underlying diseases. Of particular interest is the potential that genetic polymorphisms in these genes may be influencing the disparity of COVID-19 mortality rates in Black communities. Here, we review the evidence that biological predisposition for high-risk comorbid conditions may be relevant to our ability to fully understand and therefore address health disparities of COVID-19 deaths in Blacks.","output":"The Perfect Storm: COVID-19 Health Disparities in US Blacks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the ability of Luminore CopperTouch copper and copper-nickel surfaces to inactivate filoviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Northwestern HCW SARS-CoV-2 Serology Cohort Study. We used the Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay to determine seropositivity. Logistic regression models (adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, health care delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status. RESULTS: A total of 6510 HCWs, including 1794 nurses and 904 non-patient-facing administrators, participated. The majority were women (79.6%), 74.9% were White, 9.7% were Asian, 7.3% were Hispanic, and 3.1% were non-Hispanic Black. The crude prevalence of seropositivity was 4.8% (95% CI, 4.6%C5.2%). Seropositivity varied by race/ethnicity as well as age, ranging from 4.2% to 9.6%. Out-of-hospital exposure to COVID-19 occurred in 9.3% of HCWs, 15.0% (95% CI, 12.2%C18.1%) of whom were seropositive; those with family members diagnosed with COVID-19 had a seropositivity rate of 54% (95% CI, 44.2%C65.2%). Support service workers (10.4%; 95% CI, 4.6%C19.4%), medical assistants (10.1%; 95% CI, 5.5%C16.6%), and nurses (7.6%; 95% CI, 6.4%C9.0%) had significantly higher seropositivity rates than administrators (referent; 3.3%; 95% CI, 2.3%C4.4%). However, after adjustment, nursing was the only occupation group with a significantly higher odds (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3C2.9) of seropositivity. Exposure to patients receiving high-flow oxygen therapy and hemodialysis was significantly associated with 45% and 57% higher odds for seropositive status, respectively.

The patients' age and sex; shape, size, and site of the lesion; duration; and treatment response rate were evaluated. RESULTS The most frequent site of mucoceles was the lower labial mucosa, and several were <10 mm in size. The age of onset was often <20 years, with no sex-based differences. The treatment response rate was 65.8% for steroid ointment and 100% for surgical removal. In the subgroup analysis according to each clinical factor, some subgroups showed statistically nonsignificant differences compared with the surgery group. Among them, the older age and short disease duration subgroups showed small risk differences, suggesting that application of ointment may lead to a response in these subgroups.

Here, we identify Aldo-Keto Reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) as a key enzyme involved in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The analysis of transcriptomic data from lung samples of patients who died from COVID-19 demonstrates an increased expression of the gene encoding AKR1B10. Measurements of the AKR1B10 protein in sera from hospitalised COVID-19 patients suggests a significant link between AKR1B10 levels and the severity of the disease. In macrophages and lung cells, the over-expression of AKR1B10 induces the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor a (TNF), supporting the biological plausibility of an AKR1B10 involvement in the COVID-19-related cytokine storm. When macrophages were stressed by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) exposure and treated by Zopolrestat, an AKR1B10 inhibitor, the LPS-induced production of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF is significantly reduced, reinforcing the hypothesis that the pro-inflammatory expression of cytokines is AKR1B10-dependant. Finally, we also show that AKR1B10 can be secreted and transferred via extracellular vesicles between different cell types, suggesting that this protein may also contribute to the multi-organ systemic impact of COVID-19. These experiments highlight a relationship between AKR1B10 production and severe forms of COVID-19. Our data indicate that AKR1B10 participates in the activation of cytokines production and suggest that modulation of AKR1B10 activity might be an actionable pharmacological target in COVID-19 management.","output":"AKR1B10, One of the Triggers of Cytokine Storm in SARS-CoV2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Companion animal death is a common source of grief, although the extent and context of that grief is poorly understood, especially in older adulthood. The aim of this multiple-methods study was to develop a greater understanding of the impact of companion animal death on older women living alone in the community, as older women are a distinct at-risk group, and the supports that should be available to help these individuals with their grief. METHODS: Participants were recruited from across Alberta, a Canadian province, through seniors organizations, pet rescue groups, and social media groups of interest to older women. After completing a pre-interview online questionnaire to gain demographic information and standardized pet attachment and grief measures data, participants were interviewed through the Zoom ? computer program or over the telephone.

RESULTS: In 2020, twelve participants completed the pre-interview questionnaires and nine went on to provide interview data for analysis. All were older adult (age 55+) women, living alone in the community, who had experienced the death of a companion animal in 2019. On the standardized measures, participants scored highly on attachment and loss, but low on guilt and anger. The interview data revealed three themes: catastrophic grief and multiple major losses over the death of their companion animal, immediate steps taken for recovery, and longer-term grief and loss recovery.

With this set-up, you can estimate something's temperature from a distance, without having to go close to the thing you're trying to measure. Because thermocouples or other test type sensors cannot be used or do not provide precise information for a variety of reasons, the infrared temperature sensor is useful for estimating temperature.

This device may be used to maintain a gap of at least 6 feet between devices by measuring distance using ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. There are two nodes in an ultrasonic sensor: a transmitter and a receiver. When the transmitter fires, an ultrasonic wave is thrown out, and this wave hits everything in its path before returning to the transmitter. Using the time it takes for the wave to return to the sensor after being bounced, the sensor determines the obstacle's distance from that sensor.

However, the idea that this rule can apply to every pregnant female - young or old, nulliparous or multigravida, Caucasian, Asian, African, or Indigenous - stretches credulity. In addition, many women regard the 40-week date as a deadline, which if crossed, may then place the baby under stress.

Due attention must be paid to this subject in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delirium, the detection of which takes less than two minutes, is frequently underestimated during daily routine ICU care, but it may be a prodromal symptom of infection or hypoxia associated with severe respiratory failure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, systematic delirium monitoring using validated tests (CAM-ICU or ICDSC) may be sacrificed. This is likely to be due to the fact that the main emphasis is placed on organisational issues, i.e. the lack of ventilators, setting priorities for limited mechanical ventilation options, and a shortage of personal protective equipment. Early identification of patients with delirium is critical in patients with COVID-19 because the occurrence of delirium may be an early symptom of worsening respiratory failure or of infectious spread to the CNS mediated by potential neuroinvasive mechanisms of the coronavirus.

The richest dietary sources of resveratrol are berries and grapes, their juices and wines. Good bioavailability of resveratrol is not reflected in its high biological activity in vivo because of resveratrol isomerization and its poor solubility in aqueous solutions. Proteins, cyclodextrins and nanomaterials have been explored as innovative delivery vehicles for resveratrol to overcome this limitation. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated beneficial effects of resveratrol in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Main beneficial effects of resveratrol intake are cardioprotective, anti-hypertensive, vasodilatory, anti-diabetic, and improvement of lipid status. As resveratrol can alleviate the numerous factors associated with CVD, it has potential as a functional supplement to reduce COVID-19 illness severity in patients displaying poor prognosis due to cardio-vascular complications. Resveratrol was shown to mitigate the major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 including regulation of the renin-angiotensin system and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, stimulation of immune system and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release. Therefore, several studies already have anticipated potential implementation of resveratrol in COVID-19 treatment. Regular intake of resveratrol rich diet, or resveratrol-based complementary medicaments, may contribute to a healthier cardio-vascular system, prevention and control of CVD, including COVID-19 disease related complications of CVD.","output":"Role of Resveratrol in Prevention and Control of Cardiovascular Disorders and Cardiovascular Complications Related to Covid-19 Disease: Mode of Action and Approaches Explored to Increase Its Bioavailability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionPositive work engagement can increase in times of hard pressures, and especially when organisational resources are at place.

The experts rated 11 technical investment areas and 37 interventions on a 5-point scale in terms of their importance to COVID-19 response. Initial findings were discussed at a virtual meeting where experts suggested modifications. A group of 19 experts then rated a revised list of 11 technical areas and 39 interventions. Consensus was defined as at least 80% of experts agreeing on the importance of a technical area or intervention; stability of scores across the rounds was identified using Wilcoxon matched-pairs and unpaired signed rank tests. Between the initial and final menu, 3 technical areas and 7 interventions were slightly modified, 3 interventions were added, and 1 intervention was removed. Consensus was reached on all 11 technical areas and 35 of the final 39 interventions, and between 34 and 37 interventions were stable across rounds depending on the test used. In this exercise, the health security experts agreed that COVID-19 response financing should prioritize interventions that enhance a country's capacity to test, trace, and treat high-risk populations.

This paper introduces a novel two-phase approach for classifying chest X-ray images. Deep Learning (DL) methods fail to cover these aspects since training and fine-tuning the model's parameters consume much time. In this approach, the first phase comes to train a deep CNN working as a feature extractor, and the second phase comes to use Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for real-time detection. The main drawback of ELMs is to meet the need of a large number of hidden-layer nodes to gain a reliable and accurate detector in applying image processing since the detective performance remarkably depends on the setting of initial weights and biases. Therefore, this paper uses Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) to improve results and increase the reliability of the network while maintaining real-time capability. The designed detector is to be benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, and the results are verified by comparing it with the classic DCNN, Genetic Algorithm optimized ELM (GA-ELM), Cuckoo Search optimized ELM (CS-ELM), and Whale Optimization Algorithm optimized ELM (WOA-ELM). The proposed approach outperforms other comparative benchmarks with 98.25 % and 99.11 % as ultimate accuracy on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, respectively, and it led relative error to reduce as the amount of 1.75 % and 1.01 % as compared to a convolutional CNN.

Current management of AMR-RTI patients focuses on pathogen-directed antimicrobial treatment. Overt lung inflammation, parenchymal damage, and ineffective immune activation perpetrate increased patient morbidity and mortality. Immunomodulatory and tissue-regenerative host-directed therapies (HDT) may improve treatment outcomes. HDTs under investigation for improving AMR-RTI treatment outcomes are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS Various HDTs are being developed or evaluated for adjunctive AMR-RTI treatment. -1 antitrypsin was shown to reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa burden in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. Cellular therapy by reinfusing autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs into MDR/XDR-TB patients shows promise, whereas adjunctive T cell-based therapies are considered. Cytotoxic therapy using etoposide, a topoisomerase II-inhibiting anticancer drug extends survival of patients with severe influenza H1N1 infection-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Two other novel HDT candidates, DAS181 and resveratrol show antiinfluenza effects. Novel kinase inhibitors SB203580 (MAPK-2 antagonist) and LY294002 (phosphoinositide-3 kinases antagonist) exhibit promising anti-MERS-CoV activity. Palivizumab, an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, effectively prevents RSV infection in high-risk paediatric populations.

This is because the mortality of infectious diseases determines the basic policy stance of measures to prevent infectious diseases. Early screening of high-risk groups and taking action are the basics of disease management. This study examined the correlation of comorbidities on the mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We constructed epidemiologic characteristics and medical history database based on the Korean National Health Insurance Service Big Data and linked COVID-19 registry data of Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) for this emergent observational cohort study. A total of 9,148 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Mortalities by sex, age, district, income level and all range of comorbidities classified by International Classification of Diseases-10 based 298 categories were estimated. RESULTS: There were 3,556 male confirmed cases, 67 deaths, and crude death rate (CDR) of 1.88%. There were 5,592 females, 63 deaths, and CDR of 1.13%. The most confirmed cases were 1,352 patients between the ages of 20 to 24, followed by 25 to 29. As a result of multivariate logistic regression analysis that adjusted epidemiologic factors to view the risk of death, the odds ratio of death would be hemorrhagic conditions and other diseases of blood and blood-forming organs 3.88-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-9.88), heart failure 3.17-fold (95% CI, 1.88-5.34), renal failure 3.07-fold (95% CI, 1.43-6.61), prostate malignant neoplasm 2.88-fold (95% CI, 1.01-8.22), acute myocardial infarction 2.38-fold (95% CI, 1.03-5.49), diabetes was 1.82-fold (95% CI, 1.25-2.67), and other ischemic heart disease 1.71-fold (95% CI, 1.09-2.66). CONCLUSION: We hope that this study could provide information on high risk groups for preemptive interventions. In the future, if a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, it is expected that this study will be the basic data for recommending immunization by selecting those with chronic disease that had high risk of death, as recommended target diseases for vaccination.","output":"The Correlation of Comorbidities on the Mortality in Patients with COVID-19: an Observational Study Based on the Korean National Health Insurance Big Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) can be an important alternative in COVID 19 prevention, treatment and subsequent sequelae repair.

Nurses and nursing students are an important group of health professionals who are most likely to face many challenges in this unprecedented scenario. The present study aimed at exploring the perception of nurses and nursing students regarding psychological preparedness for the pandemic (COVID-19) management. Materials & Methods: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional online survey research design. Purposive sampling was used with an attempt to represent the entire nurses (i.e. nursing officers, nurse administrators and nursing teachers) and nursing students group of India. The survey link was shared to their email ID and they were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected using Psychological Preparedness for Disaster Threat Scale (PPDTS)-Modified, General Self Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Optimism Scale and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRS). Totally 685 responses were received and 676 forms were completed which were analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Results: The mean age of the subjects was 31.72 (SD=9.58) years. Around 20% of the subjects previously had some kind of psychological training and 4% of the subjects had taken care of persons with COVID-19. Findings revealed that mean score for PPDTS, GSE, BRCS and Optimism was 73.44 (SD=10.82, 33.19 (SD=5.23), 16.79 (SD=2.73) and 9.61 (SD=2.26) respectively indicating that the subjects had moderate level of psychological preparedness, self-efficacy and resilience but higher level of optimism. Psychological preparedness, self-efficacy, optimism and resilience were positively correlated to each other. Self- efficacy, optimism, and resilience emerged as predictors of psychological preparedness.

Their main concerns included physical ability to perform some of the mindfulness techniques (e.g. yoga) and logistic barriers, such as schedule constraints. They also provided some suggestions to further tailor the mindfulness-based stress reduction, such as modifying yoga, using familiar terms, and combining both in-person and online components. These results suggest that African American women living with HIV showed strong interest in mindfulness-based stress reduction and a high level of willingness to participate in mindfulness-based stress reduction, but the existing mindfulness-based stress reduction program needs to be tailored to address challenges and barriers these women may face for attendance and completion. CONCLUSION: The next step is to further test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy through a pilot study for African American women living with HIV to practice a tailored mindfulness-based stress reduction for this group.","output":"Attitudes toward a mindfulness-based intervention from African American women living with HIV: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If noninvasive ventilation (NIV or high-flow CPAP) fails in severe cases of COVID-19, escalation of treatment with orotracheal intubation and intermitted prone positioning is provided as standard care.

Helpbeatcovid19.org captures social determinants of health (SDOH) data. This presentation will report research in progress to understand the utility of self-reported data with communicable disease outbreaks. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Individuals voluntarily completed an online questionnaire at HelpBeatCOVID19.org which captured SDOH data and other disease surveillance variables including zip code, gender, age group, race, ethnicity, symptoms, underlying conditions, type of home (e.g., single-family, mobile home, etc.), and household COVID-19 diagnosis status. The data are stored on HIPAA-compliant servers. De-identified self-reported data were culled from the HelpBeatCOVID19 database, cleaned, sorted, and analyzed by zip code. Using STATA/SE 16.1, we employed regression analysis to determine if there might be any statistically significant associations that could be made based on zip codes, especially where there are health disparities in historically African American neighborhoods in Jefferson County. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: To date, 102,308 people have reported their symptoms in HelpBeatCOVID19. Of those, 77,903 are from Alabama. More than half of the people who completed HelpBeatCOVID19.org reported zero symptoms. However, 19.3% of Alabamians reported having underlying health conditions. Midfield, AL, a predominantly African-American neighborhood (81.1%), has 74.1% of people reporting underlying conditions where the median household income is $38,750. By comparison, Vestavia Hills, AL, a more affluent neighborhood with an 88.8% White population and median household income being $109,485, had more people participating in HelpBeatCOVID19 (3,920), yet a smaller percentage (15.2%) with underlying health conditions. Final results will be reported during the ACTS Conference. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis of the data reveals that in Jefferson County, AL, a greater number of people in affluent communities participated in the study. Whereas state-wide, a greater percentage of individuals indicated that they had zero symptoms.

Although technically feasible most of them are still constrained to laboratory scale production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop reasonable scale-up strategies for bioprocesses aiming at the overproduction of targeted natural products under industrial scale conditions. To this end, we used the production of the antibiotic valinomycin in E. coli as a model system for scalable bioprocess development based on consistent fed-batch cultivations. RESULTS In this work, the glucose limited fed-batch strategy based on pure mineral salt medium was used throughout all scales for valinomycin production. The optimal glucose feed rate was initially detected by the use of a biocatalytically controlled glucose release (EnBase? technology) in parallel cultivations in 24-well plates with continuous monitoring of pH and dissolved oxygen. These results were confirmed in shake flasks, where the accumulation of valinomycin was highest when the specific growth rate decreased below 0.1 h(-1). This correlation was also observed for high cell density fed-batch cultivations in a lab-scale bioreactor. The bioreactor fermentation produced valinomycin with titers of more than 2 mg L(-1) based on the feeding of a concentrated glucose solution. Valinomycin production was not affected by oscillating conditions (i.e. glucose and oxygen) in a scale-down two-compartment reactor, which could mimic similar situations in industrial bioreactors, suggesting that the process is very robust and a scaling of the process to a larger industrial scale appears a realistic scenario. CONCLUSIONS Valinomycin production was scaled up from mL volumes to 10 L with consistent use of the fed-batch technology. This work presents a robust and reliable approach for scalable bioprocess development and represents an example for the consistent development of a process for a heterologously expressed natural product towards the industrial scale.","output":"Scale-up bioprocess development for production of the antibiotic valinomycin in Escherichia coli based on consistent fed-batch cultivations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a worldwide pandemic. Many clinical trials have been initiated to fight the disease. Among those, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had initially been suggested to improve clinical outcomes. Despite any demonstrated beneficial effects, they are still in use in some countries but have been reported to prolong the QT interval and induce life-threatening arrhythmia. Since a significant proportion of the world population may be treated with such COVID-19 therapies, evaluation of the arrhythmogenic risk of any candidate drug is needed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the O'Hara-Rudy computer model of human ventricular wedge, we evaluate the arrhythmogenic potential of clinical factors that can further alter repolarization in COVID-19 patients in addition to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) such as tachycardia, hypokalaemia, and subclinical to mild long QT syndrome. Hydroxychloroquine and AZM drugs have little impact on QT duration and do not induce any substrate prone to arrhythmia in COVID-19 patients with normal cardiac repolarization reserve. Nevertheless, in every tested condition in which this reserve is reduced, the model predicts larger electrocardiogram impairments, as with dofetilide. In subclinical conditions, the model suggests that mexiletine limits the deleterious effects of AZM and HCQ. CONCLUSION: By studying the HCQ and AZM co-administration case, we show that the easy-to-use O'Hara-Rudy model can be applied to assess the QT-prolongation potential of off-label drugs, beyond HCQ and AZM, in different conditions representative of COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the potential impact of additional drug used to limit the arrhythmogenic risk.","output":"Modelling sudden cardiac death risks factors in patients with coronavirus disease of 2019: the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In Japan, the number of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has increased since the first case was confirmed in January 2020, reaching more than ten thousand cases as of April 30, 2020.

This is particularly alarming in case of pediatric patients as they are unable to understand the implications of it and rely on parents to make decisions regarding their health. This study was undertaken to find out the prevalence of leave against medical advice among pediatric patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Nepal. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Pediatrics, Manipal Teaching Hospital between August 2019 and July 2020. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee (Ref: 256). Convenient sampling method was used. Data entry and analysis was done on Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 23. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS: Out of 1608 pediatric admissions taken in our study, the prevalence of leave against medical advice was found to be 67 (4.2%) at 95% Confidence Interval (3.22-5.18). Maximum 22 (33%) and minimum 6 (9%) patients respectively belonged to the age group from birth to 7 days and more than 10 years. Out of 67 cases, there were 36 (54%) males and 31 (46%) females. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of leave against medical advice among admitted pediatric patients in our study was similar to that of other studies. It is a social health problem which can be prevented by increasing the awareness and facilitating the use of health insurance schemes.

Recently, it has been shown (Popov et al., 2017) that films of nematic liquid crystals doped with chiral molecules adopt biconvex lens shapes underwater. The curved shape together with degenerate planar anchoring leads to a radial variation of the optical axis along the plane of the film, providing a Pancharatnam-Berry-type phase lens that modifies geometric optical imaging. Here, we describe nematic liquid crystal microlenses formed by the addition of chiral nanoparticles. It is found that the helical twisting power of the nanoparticles, the key factor to form the lens, is about 400 m-1, greater than that of the strongest molecular chiral dopants. We demonstrate imaging capabilities and measure the shape as well as the focal length of the chiral nanoparticle-doped liquid crystal lens. We show that measuring the shape of the lens allows one to calculate the helical pitch of the chiral nematic liquid crystal and thus determine the helical twisting power of the chiral ligand-capped nanoparticles. Such measurements require the use of only nanograms of chiral nanoparticles, which is 3 orders of magnitude less than that required by conventional techniques. Since NPs are sensitive to external stimuli such as light and electric and magnetic fields, the use of chiral NPs may allow the achievement of tunable optical properties for such microlens arrays.","output":"Converging Microlens Array Using Nematic Liquid Crystals Doped with Chiral Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is currently a pandemic in the world, can invade multiple systems, and has a high morbidity and mortality.

Unfortunately, most CF research teams still do not fully partner with people with CF or their caregivers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the interest, knowledge gaps, and desired format for patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) training in the CF community. METHODS: We surveyed patients, caregivers, researchers, research staff, and diverse health care providers via list servers and social media outreach about their knowledge of, experience with, and preferences for PCOR training components. We followed the survey with 3 small-group discussion sessions with 22 participants who completed the survey to establish consensus and prioritize key learning components of a PCOR training program. We summarized results using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 170 participants completed the survey (patients/caregivers: 96/170, 56.5%; researchers/health care providers: 74/170, 43.5%). Among providers, 26% (19/74) were physicians/advanced practice providers, 20% (15/74) were nurses, and 54% (40/74) were from other disciplines. Among all participants, 86.5% (147/170) expressed interest in learning about PCOR, although training topics and training format differed between the patient/caregiver and researcher/health care provider groups. Before participating in PCOR, patients/caregivers wanted to understand more about expectations of them as partners on PCOR research teams (82/96, 85%). Meanwhile, researchers/health care providers desired information on how to include outcomes important to patients/caregivers (55/74, 74%) and the quality and impact of PCOR research (52/74, 70% and 51/74, 69%, respectively). Patients/caregivers were most interested in learning about the time commitment as a PCOR team member (75/96, 78%). Researchers/health care providers wanted to receive training about how to establish trust (47/74, 64%) and maintain confidentiality (47/74, 64%) when including patient or caregiver partners on the PCOR team. During follow-up discussions, participants emphasized the importance of addressing the traditional patient/caregiver and researchers/health care provider hierarchy by teaching about transparency, appreciation, creating a common language between the groups, and providing specific training on how to do PCOR. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest CF community members are interested in PCOR. A high-quality training program would fill a current deficit in methodological research.

Moreover, BIX01294 reduces tumor growth and metastases in two spontaneous metastases mouse models. We further identified the sialidase NEU1 as a direct target and effector of G9a in the metastatic process in EWS.

Clinical case On June 20, 2020, a 34-year-old woman, 25 weeks pregnant, is transferred from Hospital de San Bernardo to Clinica Las Condes in Santiago, Chile, with a ten-day evolution of a COVID-19 that evolves to critical with severe respiratory failure. She is admitted to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. Chest computerized axial tomography images demonstrate bilateral pneumopathy with characteristic images of ground-glass opacities, associated with interstitial thickening, images previously described as characteristics for COVID-19. The patient remains in the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation for seven days, with subsequent favorable evolution, improvement of the septic condition, and discharge after 22 days of hospitalization. Delivery occurs at 38 weeks, the mother and the newborn evolve in good general condition. The placental histopathological examination demonstrates villous inflammatory involvement, and the newborn's blood tests show the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies. It is one of the few reported cases of transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the newborn.","output":"COVID-19 Y EMBARAZO: CASO CLNICO DE PRESENTACIN CRTICA, INFLAMACIN PLACENTARIA Y TRANSMISIN VERTICAL FETAL DEMOSTRADA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is related to new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has mobilized several scientifics to explore clinical data using soft-computing approaches. In the context of machine learning, previous studies have explored supervised algorithms to predict and support diagnosis based on several clinical parameters from patients diagnosed with and without COVID-19. However, in most of them the decision is based on a \\"black-box\\" method, making it impossible to discover the variable relevance in decision making. Hence, in this study, we introduce a non-supervised clustering analysis with neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) as a strategy of decision-making. We propose to identify potential variables in routine blood tests that can support clinician decision-making during COVID-19 diagnosis at hospital admission, facilitating rapid medical intervention. Based on SOM features (visual relationships between clusters and identification of patterns and behaviors), and using linear discriminant analysis , it was possible to detect a group of units of the map with a discrimination power around 83% to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. In addition, we identified some variables in admission blood tests (Leukocytes, Basophils, Eosinophils, and Red cell Distribution Width) that, in combination had strong influence in the clustering performance, which could assist a possible clinical decision. Thus, although with limitations, we believe that SOM can be used as a soft-computing approach to support clinician decision-making in the context of COVID-19.","output":"Simple hemogram to support the decision-making of COVID-19 diagnosis using clusters analysis with self-organizing maps neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus Epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been examined but socio-economic aspects have been less studied This study aimed to identify the role of the human development index (HDI) in the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 worldwide Information on the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer and data about the HDI 2019 were obtained from the World Bank database Correlations between incidence, mortality rates and HDI parameters were assessed using linear regression We calculated the concentration index to measure socio-economic inequality in COVID-19-related mortality and incidence A linear regression analysis showed a direct significant correlation between the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 and HDI at the global level The concentration index was positive for incidence rate (0 62) and mortality rate (0 69) of COVID-19, indicating the higher concentration of the rates among groups with high HDI The high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in countries with high and very high HDI are remarkable and should be the top priority for interventions by global health policy-makers Health programmes should be provided to reduce the burden of this disease in regions with high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19","output":"Socio-economic inequality in global incidence and mortality rates from coronavirus disease 2019: an ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To mitigate the effects of COVID-19, Health Ministries across Canada have enacted numerous public health measures.

We estimated the national-level impact of the initial phases of the US COVID-19 vaccination programme on COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths among adults aged 65 years and older. METHODS: We analysed population-based data reported to US federal agencies on COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths among adults aged 50 years and older during the period Nov 1, 2020, to April 10, 2021. We calculated the relative change in incidence among older age groups compared with a younger reference group for pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods, defined by the week when vaccination coverage in a given age group first exceeded coverage in the reference age group by at least 1%; time lags for immune response and time to outcome were incorporated. We assessed whether the ratio of these relative changes differed when comparing the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods. FINDINGS: The ratio of relative changes comparing the change in the COVID-19 case incidence ratio over the post-vaccine versus pre-vaccine periods showed relative decreases of 53% (95% CI 50 to 55) and 62% (59 to 64) among adults aged 65 to 74 years and 75 years and older, respectively, compared with those aged 50 to 64 years. We found similar results for emergency department visits with relative decreases of 61% (52 to 68) for adults aged 65 to 74 years and 77% (71 to 78) for those aged 75 years and older compared with adults aged 50 to 64 years. Hospital admissions declined by 39% (29 to 48) among those aged 60 to 69 years, 60% (54 to 66) among those aged 70 to 79 years, and 68% (62 to 73), among those aged 80 years and older, compared with adults aged 50 to 59 years.

Government disease control measures were put in place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties. This study was conducted to assess the psycho-social impacts of this disease, and this paper reports the prevalence of, and factors influencing, psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: Data were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups. Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: In total, 2760 people participated in this study. Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 > 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general population. Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.57C2.55; p < 0.001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.36C2.46; p < 0.001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones). Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally. Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications. Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.82C2.73; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although, methodologically, this study had good internal validity, it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify, bound, or sample the target population accurately. However, this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza.","output":"Factors influencing psychological distress during a disease epidemic: Data from Australia's first outbreak of equine influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of experts available for the management of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in rural and underserved areas in India is limited.

The trends and characteristics of air pollutant concentrations, especially PM2.5, ozone, and related substances, over the past 30 years, are analyzed, and the relationships between concentrations and emissions are discussed quantitatively. We found that PM2.5 mass concentrations have decreased, with the largest reduction in elemental carbon (EC) as the PM2.5 component. The concentrations of organic carbon (OC) have not changed significantly compared to other components, suggesting that especially VOC emissions as precursors need to be reduced. In addition, the analysis of the differences in PM2.5 concentrations between the ambient and the roadside showed that further research on non-exhaust particles is needed. For NOx and SO2, there is a linear relationship between domestic anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric concentrations, indicating that emission control measures are directly effective in the reduction in concentrations.

The relationship between family function and loneliness was mediated by hope, and expressive suppression concurrently moderated the relationship between hope and loneliness. Our study offers meaningful insights into the family function of Chinese secondary vocational school students. The findings supported a moderated mediation model that exemplifies the relationship between family function, loneliness, expressive suppression, and hope. Although the results showed that high hope mediated lower family functioning and loneliness, low expressive suppression led to intense loneliness immediately.

The high fatality rate of up to 90% demands the broad study of MARV diseases (MVD) that correspond with MARV infection. Since large outbreaks are rare for MARV, clinical investigations are often inadequate for providing the substantial data necessary to determine the treatment of MARV disease. Therefore, an overall review may contribute to minimizing the limitations associated with future medical research and improve the clinical management of MVD.

High-resolution MR images of the pelvis were acquired 6 weeks and 8 months postsurgery. 3D models were created using semiautomatic segmentation techniques. Conformational changes were recorded quantitatively using part-comparison analysis. An ellipticity measure is proposed to record longitudinal conformational changes in the mesh arms. The surface that is the effective reinforcement provided by the mesh is calculated using a novel methodology. The area of this surface is the effective support area (ESA). RESULTS MR-visible mesh was clearly outlined in the images, which allowed us to longitudinally quantify mesh configuration between 6 weeks and 8 months after implantation. No significant changes were found in mesh position, effective support area, conformation of the mesh's main body, and arm length during the period of observation. Ellipticity profiles show longitudinal conformational changes in posterior arms.

The primary objective of this observational study was to describe the thromboprophylactic strategy implemented in routine practice. The main secondary objective was to assess the incidence of outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients admitted to public or private hospitals for abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery were included between November 2009 and November 2010; endoscopic route for surgery was the only exclusion criterion. Study outcomes were recorded at hospital discharge and at routine follow-up (generally 93weeks). RESULTS 2380 patients (meanSD age: 66.411.6years, women: 36.8%) admitted to hospital for abdominal (47.8%), urological (41%), or gynaecological (11.2%) cancer surgery were included in the analysis. Of these, 2179 had data available at study end. Perioperative antithrombotic prophylaxis, consisting mainly of low-molecular-weight heparin, was given to 99.5% of patients. At hospital discharge, thromboprophylaxis was continued in 91.7% of patients, 57.4% receiving a 4-6week prophylaxis. This management strategy was associated with an overall venous thromboembolic event rate of 1.9%, 34.7% of events occurring after discharge. Incidences of fatal bleeding, bleeding in a critical organ and bleeding necessitating re-intervention were 0.1%, 0.3% and 1.7%, respectively. Overall mortality was 1.5%.

Persistent systemic inflammation may be provoking vascular dysfunction, an early indication of cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS: In order to establish the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the systemic vasculature in the arms and legs, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of young healthy adults (Control: 5M/15F, 23.01.3y, 1679cm, 63.07.4kg) and young adults who, 3-4 weeks prior to testing, had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2: 4M/7F, 20.21.1y, 17212cm, 69.512.4kg) (meanSD). Using Doppler ultrasound, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the arm and single passive limb movement (sPLM) in the leg were assessed as markers of vascular function. Pulse wave velocity (PWVcf) was assessed as a marker of arterial stiffness. RESULTS: FMD was lower in the SARS-CoV-2 group (2.711.21%) compared to the Control group (8.812.96%) (P<0.01) and when made relative to the shear stimulus (SARS-CoV-2: 0.040.02AU, Control: 0.130.06AU, P<0.01).

Yet a decision-maker (whether human or artificial) can only make truly ethical (based on any ethical theory) and fair (according to any notion of fairness) decisions if full information on all the relevant factors on which the decision is based are available at the time of decision-making.

In addition, all original clinical samples and the resulting isolates were genotyped by multi-nested PCR-RFLP analysis of 11 molecular markers and by PCR-DNA sequencing of portions of the SAG3, GRA6 and GRA7 genes. RESULTS: As a result, 30 isolates were obtained from 9 Spanish regions: 10 isolates from abortion-derived samples and 20 isolates from adult myocardial tissues. Overall, 3 genotypes were found: ToxoDB#3 (type II PRU variant) in 90% (27/30) of isolates, ToxoDB#2 (clonal type III) in 6.7% (2/30), and ToxoDB#1 (clonal type II) in 3.3% (1/30). When T. gondii-positive tissue samples (n = 151) were directly subjected to RFLP genotyping, complete restriction profiles were obtained for 33% of samples, and up to 98% of the specimens belonged to the type II PRU variant. A foetal brain showed a clonal type II pattern, and four specimens showed unexpected type I alleles at the SAG3 marker, including two foetal brains that showed I + II alleles as co-infection events. Amplicons of SAG3, GRA6 and GRA7 obtained from isolates and clinical samples were subjected to sequencing, allowing us to confirm RFLP results and to detect different single-nucleotide polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: The present study informed the existence of a predominant type II PRU variant genotype (ToxoDB#3) infecting domestic sheep in Spain, in both abortion cases and chronic infections in adults, coexisting with other clonal (ToxoDB#1 and ToxoDB#2), much less frequent genotypes, as well as polymorphic strains as revealed by clinical sample genotyping. The use of multilocus sequence typing aided in accurately estimating T. gondii intragenotype diversity.

Weighted mean willingness to volunteer during a disaster was 68.4% (SD = 21.7%, n = 2911), and there was a significant difference between those planning to volunteer and those who actually volunteered (P<.001). We identified a number of modifiable barriers which may contribute to this difference. Overall, knowledge of disasters was poor with a weighted mean of 48.9% (SD = 15.1%, n = 2985). CONCLUSIONS: There is a large number of students who are willing to volunteer during pandemics. However, they are likely to be under-prepared for these roles due to poor overall knowledge and limited teaching.

We further analyze the feasibility of a remotely-hosted training program that provides the knowledge and skills to administer tDCS at home, without requiring them to visit the lab.

This study investigated the trends in anxiety and performance of preventive measures among Taiwanese citizens during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study employed an anonymous online survey to investigate anxiety and preventive behavior practice in adults during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 6-item state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to measure symptoms of anxiety. The preventive measures consisted of 12 items divided into three categories: Personal protection, cough etiquette, and social distance and voluntary quarantine. The three time periods studied were the lockdown in Wuhan, China (from January 23 to February 7), the week when enhanced border protections and in-person mask purchase systems were introduced and the first citizen tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms (from February 8 to February 16), and the 10 days following the first death from COVID-19 in Taiwan (from February 27 to March 9). The Cochran-Armitage trend test and the Jonckheere trend test were used to analyze changes in the degree of anxiety and the adoption of preventive measures in the early stages of the epidemic. An analysis of covariance was performed to examine the relationship between changes in anxiety and engagement in preventive behaviors after control for sex, age, education, and income. Results: The percentages of the participants with moderate to high levels of anxiety during the three time periods were 45%, 50%, and 55%, respectively. The percentages of those who practiced preventive measures often or always during the three time periods were 46%, 58%, and 66%, respectively. Significant increases were found both in levels of anxiety and in performance of preventive measures over the three time periods, but no differences across sex, age, education, or income groups were found. Changes in anxiety and performance of preventive behaviors were significantly associated during the three periods. Conclusions: The results revealed that as the pandemic spread, citizens' anxiety, and performance of preventive measures increased significantly for each sex, age, education level, and income group. ? 2021 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

METHODS: Placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were quantified in 68 pregnant individuals (38 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 30 SARS-CoV-2 negative) delivering at Mass General Brigham from April to June 2020. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Placental SARS-CoV-2 viral load was quantified. RTqPCR was performed to quantify expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 relative to the reference gene YWHAZ. Western blots were performed on placental homogenates to quantify protein levels. The impact of fetal sex and SARS-CoV-2 exposure on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 virus was undetectable in all placentas.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries enforced lockdowns that reduced vehicular traffic and consequently wildlife-vehicle collisions. However, no study has yet explored how traffic-related mortality declined across multiple species of wildlife, leaving doubts about the species-specific impact of COVID-19 on wildlife ecology and management. We modelled how two lockdowns (in spring and autumn 2020) influenced wildlife-vehicle collisions throughout Slovenia, in central Europe, by comparing weekly roadkill in 2020 with 2010?2019 time series for European roe deer (n = 53,259), red fox (n = 9,889), Eurasian badger (n = 5,170), brown hare (n = 5,050), stone marten (n = 4,267), wild boar (n = 1,188), and red deer (n = 1,088). During the spring lockdown (16 March ? 30 April 2020), we observed far fewer collisions than expected for roe deer and badgers. During the autumn lockdown (20 October ? 31 December 2020), we observed significantly fewer collisions for roe deer and wild boar, but we noted an excess of collisions with badgers. Traffic reduction had a major influence on roe deer, whose roadkill decreased by between 156?321 individuals. Heterogeneous changes in road mortality across the seven studied species indicate that reductions in human mobility can trigger complex species-specific dynamics in wildlife assemblages, which may generate compensatory effects beyond lockdowns. For some species, such as roe deer, local reductions in the number of roadkill attained a significant fraction of the overall mortality. This could affect local population dynamics in cases where lockdowns are repeated over a number of years. Policy implications. Management aimed at reducing vehicular traffic, and therefore human disturbance and roadkill, can be evaluated using time-series analysis of data on multiple species. During times of restricted human movement, local-scale reductions should be estimated and accounted for in adaptive management, such as for planning culling quotas, to minimize their ecological and socio-economic impacts while optimizing outcomes of science-based population management.","output":"Wildlife roadkill and COVID-19: a biologically significant, but heterogeneous, reduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration has been proposed as a potential causal factor in COVID-19 risk.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a potential link between 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality. Randomised trials are needed to prove a beneficial role for vitamin D in the prevention of severe COVID-19 reactions or death.","output":"Vitamin D and COVID-19 infection and mortality in UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A knowledge of perioperative problems and complications is an important requirement for surgeons. Diabetic patients are a particular group of patients that are specifically at risk of problems. These risks are not only related to the underlying pathophysiological process associated with the disease, but can also occur secondarily to medications used to manage the condition and require careful monitoring, and is of increased importance in the perioperative period. Although a number of medications have historically been used to manage diabetes, a relatively novel group of diabetic medications 'SGLT2 inhibitors' are now being used and have been shown to have many positive attributes, when considering the sequalae of diabetes. However, they have also been associated with significant perioperative problems, which are a consequence of euglycaemic ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Given the significant complications associated with these medications, it is important that practitioners should have an awareness of the problems related to their use. In addition, messages contained in safety releases pertaining to SGLT2 inhibitor use and their risks in patients undergoing surgery, may have been weakened due the timing of their publication in March 2020, during the first UK national lockdown amidst the Coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Life-threatening complications for diabetic patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors when undergoing surgery: A poorly recognised problem?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The growing demand for LTC (Long-term care) services for disabled elderly has become a daunting task for countries worldwide, especially China, where population aging is particularly severe. According to CSY (China Statistical Yearbook,2019), the elderly aged 65 or above has reached 167 million in 2018, and the number of disabled elderly is as high as 54%. Germany and other countries have alleviated the crisis by promoting the public LTCI (Long-Term Care Insurance) system since the 1990s, while Chinas public LTCI system formal pilot only started in 2016. Therefore, the development of the public LTCI system has gradually become a hot topic for scholars in various countries, including China. METHODS: This review has been systematically sorted the existing related literature to discuss the development of public LTCI (Long-Term Care Insurance)system form four aspects, namely, the comparison of public LTCI systems in different countries, the influence of public LTCI, challenge of public LTCI, and the relationship between public LTCI and private LTCI. We searched some databases including Web of Science Core Collection, Medline, SCOPUS, EBSCO, EMBASE, ProQuest and PubMed from January 2008 to September 2020. The quality of 38 quantitative and 21 qualitative articles was evaluated using the CASP(Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) critical evaluation checklist. RESULTS: The review systematically examines the development of public LTCI system from four aspects, namely, the comparison of public LTCI systems in different countries, the influence of public LTCI, the challenge of public LTCI, and the relationship between public LTCI and private LTCI. For example, LTCI has a positive effect on the health and life quality of the disabled elderly. However, the role of LTCI in alleviating the financial burden on families with the disabled elderly may be limited. CONCLUSION: Some policy implications on the future development of Chinas LTCI system can be obtained. For example, the government should fully consider the constraints such as price rise, the elderly disability rate, and the substantial economic burden. It also can strengthen the effective combination of public LTCI and private LTCI. It does not only help to expand the space for its theoretical research but also to learn the experiences in the practice of the LTCI system in various countries around the world. It will significantly help the smooth development and further promote the in-depth reform of the LTCI system in China.","output":"Review of evolution of the public long-term care insurance (LTCI) system in different countries: influence and challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety and distress in young people worldwide. It is important to prioritize mental health during crisis events to mitigate the negative and often long-term effects of the crises on young people, families, and society. Mental health and well-being apps represent a scalable approach for improving psychological outcomes in young people and have potential to improve the equity of service access. OBJECTIVE: The Whitu: 7 Ways in 7 Days well-being app was recently developed by our group to address the urgent need for innovative approaches to reach young New Zealanders who are struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is twofold: to evaluate the acceptability of the prototype app and to examine the effectiveness of the refined app at improving mental and emotional well-being and reducing depression, anxiety, and stress in young people in New Zealand. METHODS: A two-phase mixed methods study will be undertaken to achieve these aims. During the first phase, 20 young people aged 16-30 years (including those of Mori and Pacific ethnicity) will participate in a qualitative study to help refine the prototype app. During the second phase, 90 young people aged 16-30 years will participate in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of the refined Whitu app at 4 weeks and 3 months after baseline. Outcomes will be evaluated using validated web-based questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months. RESULTS: The study received ethics approval in May 2020, and recruitment for the focus groups commenced in June 2020. Recruitment for the RCT is expected to commence in October 2020. Participants for both study phases will be recruited via social media and web-based communities. Data collection for the RCT is expected to be completed by January 2021, and analyses are expected to be completed by March 2021. Linear mixed modelling will be used to determine between-group differences in psychological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to develop culturally appropriate, scalable mental health interventions to address the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we will develop and test an evidence-based well-being app that, if effective, can be made available to all young people in New Zealand and internationally.

We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with CPAP and determine predictors of CPAP response. DESIGN: This was a retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: The study took place in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Royal Papworth Hospital (RPH) in Cambridge, UK. PATIENTS: We included all consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who were transferred from neighbouring hospitals between 14th March and 6th May, 2020 for consideration of ventilatory support. INTERVENTION: We instituted the use of CPAP for all patients who arrived in RPH not intubated and were not making satisfactory progress on supplemental oxygen alone. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 33 self-ventilating patients included in this study, 22 (66.7%) were male and the mean age was 54  13.23 patients received CPAP. They were more hypoxaemic than those treated with oxygen alone (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio; 84.3  19.0 vs 170.0  46.0 mmHg, p = 0.001). There was a significant improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio 1C2 hours after CPAP initiation (167.4  49.0 from 84.3  19.0 mmHg, p = 0.001). 14 (61%) patients responded to CPAP and 9 required intubation. There was no difference between these two groups in terms of the severity of baseline hypoxaemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio; 84.5  16.0 vs 83.9  23.0 mmHg, p = 0.94) but CPAP responders had significantly lower C-reactive protein (CRP) (176  83 vs 274  63 mg/L, p = 0.007), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (30  47 vs 139  148 pg/mL, p = 0.037), and D-dimer (321  267 vs 941 + 1990 ng/mL, p = 0.003). CT pulmonary angiogram was performed in 6 out of 9 intubated patients and demonstrated pulmonary emboli in 5 of them. All patients were discharged from ICU and there were no fatalities. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, CPAP was an effective treatment modality to improve hypoxaemia and prevent invasive ventilation in a substantial proportion of patients with severe respiratory failure. Accepting the small sample size, we also found raised biomarkers of inflammation (CRP and IL-6) and coagulopathy (D-Dimer) to be more useful predictors of CPAP responsiveness than the severity of hypoxaemia, and could help to guide intubation decisions in this clinical setting.","output":"Positive role of continuous positive airway pressure for intensive care unit patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia: A single centre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate a feline coronavirus (FCoV) reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) on fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) collected in sterile saline for the purpose of diagnosing non-effusive feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in cats. METHODS First, the ability of the assay to detect viral RNA in MLN FNA preparations compared with MLN biopsy preparations was assessed in matched samples from eight cats. Second, a panel of MLN FNA samples was collected from a series of cats representing non-effusive FIP cases (n = 20), FCoV-seropositive individuals (n = 8) and FCoV seronegative individuals (n = 18). Disease status of the animals was determined using a combination of gross pathology, histopathology and/or 'FIP profile', consisting of serology, clinical pathology and clinical signs. RESULTS Viral RNA was detected in 18/20 non-effusive FIP cases; it was not detected in two cases that presented with neurological FIP. Samples from 18 seronegative non-FIP control cats and 7/8 samples from seropositive non-FIP control cats contained no detectable viral RNA. Thus, as a method for diagnosing non-effusive FIP, MLN FNA RT-qPCR had an overall sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 96.1%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In cases with a high index of suspicion of disease, RT-qPCR targeting FCoV in MLN FNA can provide important information to support the ante-mortem diagnosis of non-effusive FIP. Importantly, viral RNA can be reliably detected in MLN FNA samples in saline submitted via the national mail service. When applied in combination with biochemistry, haematology and serological tests in cases with a high index of suspicion of disease the results of this assay may be used to support a diagnosis of non-effusive FIP.","output":"Diagnosis of non-effusive feline infectious peritonitis by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR from mesenteric lymph node fine-needle aspirates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), the causative agent of COVID\\\\19, enters human cells by binding of its viral protein to the aminopeptidase angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This has led to speculation whether treatment with reninCangiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors was associated with an increased likelihood of a positive test for COVID\\\\19 and risk of mortality. AIMS: We performed a systematic review and meta\\\\analysis to investigate whether RAS inhibitors increased the likelihood of a positive test or death/severe illness in patients with COVID\\\\19. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE was conducted for studies stratified by the use of angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Pooled analysis was performed using a random\\\\effects model. RESULTS: Seven trials of 73 122 patients were included. Overall, 16 624 (22.7%) patients had a positive COVID\\\\19 test and 7892 (10.8%) were on a RAS inhibitor. RAS inhibitors were not associated with higher likelihood of a positive COVID\\\\19 test result (odds ratio (OR) 0.97 (95% CI 0.97C1.05, P = 0.48) with low heterogeneity.

In this paper, a method mitigating the negative effects of mask defects on face recognition is proposed. Firstly, a low-cost, accurate method of masked face synthesis, i.e. mask transfer, is proposed for data augmentation. Secondly, an attention-aware masked face recognition (AMaskNet) is proposed to improve the performance of masked face recognition, which includes two modules: a feature extractor and a contribution estimator. Therein, the contribution estimator is employed to learn the contribution of the feature elements, thus achieving refined feature representation by simple matrix multiplications. Meanwhile, the end-to-end training strategy is utilized to optimize the entire model. Finally, a mask-aware similarity matching strategy(MS) is taken to improve the performance in the inference stage. The experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms on three masked face recognition datasets: RMFRD [1], COX [2] and Public-IvS [3]. Meanwhile, qualitative analysis experiments using CAM [4] indicate that the contribution learned by AMaskNet is more conducive to masked face recognition.

The purpose of this study was to assess the status of endovascular treatment of distal ACA aneurysms by comparing our results with recent endovascular and microsurgical series of distal ACA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2000 and 2008, a total of 22 consecutive patients (14 women; mean age, 58.4 years) with distal ACA aneurysms underwent coil placement at Barrow Neurological Institute. Clinical presentations, radiographic findings, endovascular management, and outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Of the 22 patients, 13 (59%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Six patients were HH grade I or II, 1 was grade III, 5 were grade IV, and 1 was grade V. Frontal lobe hematomas occurred in 5 patients with ruptured aneurysms. The mean aneurysm size was 7.5 mm (range, 2.8-25 mm); 55% were smaller than 7 mm. Twelve aneurysms (55%) arose from the origin of the callosomarginal artery (55%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 50% of the cases and near-complete occlusion in 45%. The few periprocedural complications included 1 retroperitoneal hematoma and 1 intraoperative rupture. Four patients had thromboembolic events adequately treated intraprocedurally with abciximab. No deaths occurred in the patients treated. CONCLUSIONS The characteristics of the patients and aneurysms treated in our series were comparable to previous reports of endovascular treatment of ACA aneurysms with respect to rupture status. Periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates in our series fared well compared with previous reports, as did our combined rate of complete or near-complete occlusions.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has also been reported to occur with this virus. A cluster of cases of euglycemic DKA (euDKA) was identified in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The cases were identified by the authors while providing clinical care, and details were collected. RESULTS: Five cases of euDKA, presenting with glucose levels <300 mg/dL, were identified over the course of 2 months by the endocrinology consult service. All patients had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with no known history of DKA. All were taking SGLT2is. Oral antihyperglycemic medications were stopped for all patients on admission. All received intravenous insulin infusion to treat DKA before being transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen. SGLT2i use was discontinued for all patients who were discharged. CONCLUSION: EuDKA has been seen in the setting of acute illness in patients using SGLT2is, but this cluster of cases suggests that there is a specific association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to the known risk of euDKA with SGLT2i use, coronavirus disease 2019-specific mechanisms may include a direct toxic effect of the virus on the pancreatic islets, an accelerated inflammatory response promoting ketosis, and the diuretic effect of SGLT2i in conjunction with anorexia and vomiting. It is crucial to counsel patients to stop SGLT2is when sick, especially if SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected.","output":"EUGLYCEMIC DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES TAKING SGLT2 INHIBITORS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thailand is one of the most rapidly aging countries in Asia. Traditional family-based care, which has been the basis of most care for older people, is becoming unsustainable as families become smaller. In addition, women tend to be adversely affected as they still form the bulk of caregivers for older people, and many are likely to exit the labor market in order to provide care. Many family caregivers also have no or minimal training, and they may be called upon to provide quite complex care, increasing the proportion of older people receiving suboptimal care if they rely only on informal care that is provided by families and friends. Facing the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases and age-related morbidity, Thai communities are increasingly in need of community-integrated care models for older persons that can link existing health systems and reduce the burden upon caring families. This need is common to many countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of a community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) model to enhance family-based care for older people. METHODS: This paper describes a cluster randomized controlled trial comprised of 6 intervention clusters and 6 control clusters that aim to recruit 2000 participants in each arm. This research protocol has been approved by the World Health Organization Ethics Review Committee. The intervention clusters will receive an integrated model of care structured around (1) a community respite service, (2) the strengthening of family care capacity, and (3) an exercise program that aims to prevent entry into long-term care for older people. Control group clusters receive usual care (ie, the current system of long-term care common to all provinces in Thailand), consisting principally of a volunteer-assisted home care service. The trial will be conducted over a period of 2 years. The primary outcome is family caregiver burden measured at a 6-month follow-up, as measured by the Caregiver Burden Inventory. Secondary outcomes consist of biopsychosocial indicators including functional ability, as measured using an activity of daily living scale; depression, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale; and quality of life of older people, as measured by the EuroQol 5-dimensions 5-levels scale. Intention-to-treat analysis will be followed. RESULTS: The CIIC facility has been established. Community care prevention programs have been launched at the intervention clusters. Family caregivers are receiving training and assistance. However, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Since ASEAN and many Asian countries share similar traditional family-based, long-term care systems, the proposed CIIC model and the protocol for its implementation and evaluation may benefit other countries wishing to adopt similar community-integrated care models for older people at risk of needing long-term care.

This study aims to assess the population's willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine in Jordan and investigate potential determinants of their acceptance MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used an online survey distributed in November 2020, before introducing the vaccine, with items investigating socio-demographic characteristics, seasonal flu vaccination history, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance once available, and factors affecting their decision-making. Also, COVID-19 risk perception and beliefs toward COVID-19 vaccine benefits and barriers were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 2,208 participants completed the survey with a participation rate of 13.1%. The meanstandard deviation age was 33.213.5, and 55.7% were females. Study participants were almost equally distributed between willingness, unwillingness, and indecision to take the COVID-19 vaccine (30.4%, 36.4%, and 31.5%, respectively). Younger adults, males, and those who were not married, do not have children, have a bachelor or higher education, employees or being students, healthcare workers, and those who reported receiving flu vaccine had higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance compared to their counterparts (p<0.001 for each category). COVID-19 risk perception, and perceived vaccine benefits, and barriers were significant predictors of intention. Among those undecided or unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine, its safety and side effects were the most common concerns. CONCLUSION: The low rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in a developing country is alarming, and a significant proportion are indecisive. Interventions to elevate vaccine acceptance by addressing its safety and efficacy and targeting vulnerable groups are recommended.","output":"Determinants of the willingness of the general population to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in a developing country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The field of crisis and disaster studies has proliferated over the past two decades.

This type of screening is non-contact, easy to apply, and can reduce the workload in testing centres as well as limit transmission by recommending early self-isolation to those who have a cough suggestive of COVID-19. The datasets used in this study include subjects from all six continents and contain both forced and natural coughs, indicating that the approach is widely applicable. The publicly available Coswara dataset contains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy subjects, while the second smaller dataset was collected mostly in South Africa and contains 18 COVID-19 positive and 26 COVID-19 negative subjects who have undergone a SARS-CoV laboratory test. Both datasets indicate that COVID-19 positive coughs are 15%C20% shorter than non-COVID coughs. Dataset skew was addressed by applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A leave-p-out cross-validation scheme was used to train and evaluate seven machine learning classifiers: logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and a residual-based neural network architecture (Resnet50). Our results show that although all classifiers were able to identify COVID-19 coughs, the best performance was exhibited by the Resnet50 classifier, which was best able to discriminate between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98. An LSTM classifier was best able to discriminate between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative coughs, with an AUC of 0.94 after selecting the best 13 features from a sequential forward selection (SFS). Since this type of cough audio classification is cost-effective and easy to deploy, it is potentially a useful and viable means of non-contact COVID-19 screening.","output":"COVID-19 cough classification using machine learning and global smartphone recordings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence and management of recurrent periocular sebaceous gland carcinoma at a tertiary ocular oncology service in the United Kingdom. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 62 patients with sebaceous gland carcinoma treated between 2004 and 2017. A total of 10 eyes were treated for local recurrence. The following variables were recorded: age and sex of patient; tumour location, histological subtype; recurrence type; treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Of the 62 cases with eyelid SGC, 10 (16%) had recurrences during the study period and satisfied inclusion criteria. There were six (60%) females and four males in the recurrent group. The mean time interval between initial excision and tumour recurrence was 37 months (median 23 months; range 4 to 84 months). Four patients received cryotherapy to the lids and conjunctiva to control recurrent disease and two patients were treated with topical or intralesional chemotherapy. Four patients (40%) underwent orbital exenteration during the study period. Metastasis occurred in 20% over a mean follow-up of 113 months (median 106; range 47C184 months). CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for local recurrence of SGC after wide excision with paraffin section control were reported, and an approach to these recurrent lesions was proposed.

We aimed to verify whether there is an association between the OHCA difference compared with 2019 and the COVID-19 epidemic curve. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included all the consecutive OHCAs which occurred in the Provinces of Lodi, Cremona, Pavia, and Mantova in the 2 months following the first documented case of COVID-19 in the Lombardia Region and compared them with those which occurred in the same time frame in 2019. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 from 21 February to 20 April 2020 in the study territory was 956 COVID-19/100 000 inhabitants and the cumulative incidence of OHCA was 21 cases/100 000 inhabitants, with a 52% increase as compared with 2019 (490 OHCAs in 2020 vs. 321 in 2019). A strong and statistically significant correlation was found between the difference in cumulative incidence of OHCA between 2020 and 2019 per 100 000 inhabitants and the COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 inhabitants both for the overall territory ( 0.87, P < 0.001) and for each province separately (Lodi:  0.98, P < 0.001; Cremona:  0.98, P < 0.001; Pavia:  0.87, P < 0.001; Mantova:  0.81, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The increase in OHCAs in 2020 is significantly correlated to the COVID-19 pandemic and is coupled with a reduction in short-term outcome.

The immune response to vaccines against other infectious agents has been shown to be blunted in such patients. We aimed to analyse the humoral and cellular response to prime-boost vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in cardiothoracic transplant recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 50 transplant patients [1C3 years post heart (42), lung (7), or heartClung (1) transplant, mean age 55  10 years] and a control group of 50 healthy staff members were included. Blood samples were analysed 21 days after the prime and the boosting dose, respectively, to quantify anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) immunoglobulin titres (tested by Abbott, Euroimmun and RocheElecsys Immunoassays, each) and the functional inhibitory capacity of neutralizing antibodies (Genscript). To test for a specific T-cell response, heparinized whole blood was stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides, covering domains of the viral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane protein, and the interferon- release was measured (QuantiFERON Monitor ELISA, Qiagen). The vast majority of transplant patients (90%) showed neither a detectable humoral nor a T-cell response three weeks after the completed two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination; these results are in sharp contrast to the robust immunogenicity seen in the control group: 98% exhibited seroconversion after the prime dose already, with a further significant increase of IgG titres after the booster dose (average > tenfold increase), a more than 90% inhibition capability of neutralizing antibodies as well as evidence of a T-cell responsiveness.

However, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms.

Methods: This cross-sectional survey was carried out based on phone interviews of 1073 adults aged over 18 years from 4 to 12 April 2020 in Mashhad, Khorasan-Razavi Province, as the second largest city of Iran. A systematic random sampling was carried out using fixed phone number lists provided by Telecommunication Company of Khorasan-Razavi Province. Phone interviews were carried out by trained interviewers from the Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) at various times of the day. The survey included sociodemographic questions, perceived social support scale (MSPSS) and questions about self-isolation during the Nowruz holiday. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate logistic regression. Results: : 20.5% of participants reported poor compliance with stay at home orders during the first two weeks of Nowruz. Clear social gradients were not found in stay-at-home compliance. When controlling socio-demographic factors, perceived social support, interestingly, both fostered and hindered peoples compliance with stay at home orders, depending on the source of support from family members (OR=.874, 95% CI=.803, .950, p<.005), friends (OR=1.147, 95% CI=1.076, 1.222, p<.001) and a significant other person ( OR=.926, 95% CI=.849, 1.010, p=.084 ).

To contextualize recent findings, we offer a summative review of recent literature focused on modeling transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings. RECENT FINDINGS The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in the modeling landscape as the healthcare community has raced to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective interventions. Inequities in COVID-19 outcomes have inspired new efforts to quantify how structural bias impacts both health outcomes and model parameterization. Meanwhile, developments in the modeling of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile, and other nosocomial infections continue to advance. Machine learning continues to be applied in novel ways, and genomic data is being increasingly incorporated into modeling efforts. SUMMARY As the type and amount of data continues to grow, mathematical, statistical, and computational modeling will play an increasing role in healthcare epidemiology. Gaps remain in producing models that are generalizable to a variety of time periods, geographic locations, and populations.

Simple metrics for characterizing volatility in blood components within the hospital transfusion service have not been established. METHODS: We measured the volatility of demand for blood services at a large academic urban general hospital over a 6-month period from July 2019 to December 2019 prior to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. RESULTS: Among 4416 consecutive hours assessed, there were 693 h (16%) with spikes in demand for blood components with a mean (sd) of 3.8 (2.7) spikes/day. Spikes in demand were frequently clustered. The median number of hours between spikes differed by shift (6 h for days; 3 h for evenings; 3 h for nights). The percentage of shift hours with demand spikes also differed (9% day; 19% evening; 18% night). During the study, 32,447 components were distributed to 19,431 patients. Of these, 11,819 components (36%) were distributed during hours of peak demand. Hours with a simultaneous spike in both component demand and patient demand occurred in 5% of hours or approximately once each day. CONCLUSION: Demand for transfusion services was highly volatile in an unpredictable fashion. We provide an approach that could be used to benchmark spikes in demand for blood services at hospitals. Consideration of the frequency, unpredictability, and magnitude of spikes in demand may be relevant for hemovigilance programs and for strategies to determine the laboratory staffing needed for good patient care.","output":"Spikes in demand for hospital transfusion services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, preventive medicine has taken center stage, as there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drug regime used to treat patients.

Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.","output":"Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results in Clinical Settings: It Depends!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of a neurotropic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59, in the mouse central nervous system was studied after intranasal inoculation.

Here, three truncations of the PDCoV S protein were generated, the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (NTD, amino acids (aa) 50C286), the C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (CTD, aa 278C616), and S2 subunit (aa 601C1087). The proteins were expressed using an E. coli expression system. Polyclonal antisera against the three recombinant proteins were produced in rabbits and mice. All three antisera were able to inhibit PDCoV infection in vitro, as determined by virus neutralization assay, fluorescent focus neutralization assay, and plaque-reduction neutralization. The CTD-specific antisera had the most potent PDCoV-neutralizing effect, indicating that the CTD region may contain the major neutralizing epitope(s) in the PDCoV S protein.

annually. From serious pandemics and highly contagious infections to common influenza episodes, clinical prognosis often relies on early detection of the infectious agent. Thus, effective identification of viral pathogens is needed to help prevent transmission, set up appropriate therapy, monitor response to treatment and lead to efficient disease management and control. The aim of this review is to outline some of the recent technological advances in viral identification, including polymerase chain reaction, mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing, and how they are applied in the diagnosis and management of viral infections. These powerful tools combine rapidity and efficiency in detecting viral pathogens and have revolutionized the field of clinical diagnostics. However, a number of drawbacks such as high cost have limited their use in many laboratories, particularly in resource-limited settings.

In 2019, a newly identified type of Coronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory illness, popularly known as COVID-19, and became a pandemic. Although enormous efforts have been made to understand the spread of COVID-19, our knowledge of the COVID-19 dynamics still remains limited. The present study employs the concepts of chaos theory to examine the temporal dynamic complexity of COVID-19 around the world. The false nearest neighbor (FNN) method is applied to determine the dimensionality and, hence, the complexity of the COVID-19 dynamics. The methodology involves: (1) reconstruction of a single-variable COVID-19 time series in a multi-dimensional phase space to represent the underlying dynamics;and (2) identification of false neighbors in the reconstructed phase space and estimation of the dimension of the COVID-19 series. For implementation, COVID-19 data from 40 countries/regions around the world are studied. Two types of COVID-19 data are analyzed: (1) daily COVID-19 cases;and (2) daily COVID-19 deaths. The results for the 40 countries/regions indicate that: (1) the dynamics of COVID-19 cases exhibit low- to medium-level complexity, with dimensionality in the range 3 to 7;and (2) the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths exhibit complexity anywhere from low to high, with dimensionality ranging from 3 to 13. The results also suggest that the complexity of the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths is greater than or at least equal to that of the dynamics of COVID-19 cases for most (three-fourths) of the countries/regions.

METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. This work was pre-registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42021239687). Observational studies reporting telephone-, videoconference- or web-based assessment of cognition/behaviour in Italian both healthy participants (HPs) and patients were included. Bias assessment was performed through ad hoc scales. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included from an initial N = 895 (4 databases searched). Studies were subdivided into those focused on psychometric properties and those characterized by a predominant applied nature. The majority of studies addressed either adult/elderly HPs or neurological/internal patients.

Until recently, the exclusion of infection for pyoderma gangrenosum has been largely clinical and supported by cultures/biopsies demonstrating the absence of infection. The MolecuLight i:X (MolecuLight, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a novel bedside fluorescent imaging device capable of determining the bacterial burden within a wound in real time. Fluorescent imaging excluded infection at the initial visit, and debridement was avoided. Subsequently, pathergy was avoided as well. The patient was started on topical clobetasol with hypochlorous acid-soaked dressings. She also received 80 mg daily of prednisone and high-dose vitamin D3 (10,000 IU). Recovery was complicated by a deep tunnel along the incisional line at 3 months postdiagnosis, which required slowing of the prednisone taper and the addition of colchicine. Repeat cultures grew Parvimonas, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus species. Appropriate antibiotics were given. The patient was transitioned from prednisone to adalimumab and started on negative-pressure wound therapy. Negative-pressure wound therapy was discontinued at 5 months, and the wound resolved at 6 months.","output":"Fluorescent Imaging as a Component of Diagnosing Pyoderma Gangrenosum: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The Austrian supply of COVID-19 vaccine is limited for now. We aim to provide evidence-based guidance to the authorities in order to minimize COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths in Austria. (2) Methods: We used a dynamic agent-based population model to compare different vaccination strategies targeted to the elderly (65 &gt;= years), middle aged (45-64 years), younger (15-44 years), vulnerable (risk of severe disease due to comorbidities), and healthcare workers (HCW). First, outcomes were optimized for an initially available vaccine batch for 200,000 individuals. Second, stepwise optimization was performed deriving a prioritization sequence for 2.45 million individuals, maximizing the reduction in total hospitalizations and deaths compared to no vaccination. We considered sterilizing and non-sterilizing immunity, assuming a 70% effectiveness. (3) Results: Maximum reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved by starting vaccination with the elderly and vulnerable followed by middle-aged, HCW, and younger individuals. Optimizations for vaccinating 2.45 million individuals yielded the same prioritization and avoided approximately one third of deaths and hospitalizations. Starting vaccination with HCW leads to slightly smaller reductions but maximizes occupational safety. (4) Conclusion: To minimize COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, our study shows that elderly and vulnerable persons should be prioritized for vaccination until further vaccines are available.","output":"Targeted COVID-19 Vaccination (TAV-COVID) Considering Limited Vaccination Capacities-An Agent-Based Modeling Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent quantitative approaches for studying several aspects of urban life and infrastructure have shown that scale properties allow the understanding of many features of urban infrastructure and of human activity in cities. In this paper, we show that COVID-19 virus contamination follows a similar pattern in different regions of the world. The superlinear power-law behavior for the number of contamination cases as a function of the city population, with exponent  of the order of 1.15 is always obtained. Due to the strong indication that scaling is a determinant feature of covid-19 spread, we propose an epidemiological model that embodies a fractal structure, allowing a more detailed description of the observed data about the virus spread in different countries and regions. The hypothesis that fractal structures can be formed in cities as well as in larger networks is tested, indicating that indeed self-similarity may be found in networks connecting several cities.","output":"Fractal signatures of the COVID-19 spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine clinically approved for the treatment of melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Unfortunately, its clinical utility is hindered by serious side effects driven by the systemic activity of the cytokine. Here, we describe the design and characterization of a conditionally activated IL-2 prodrug, WTX-124, that takes advantage of the dysregulated protease milieu of tumors. WTX-124 was engineered as a single molecule containing an inactivation domain and a half-life extension domain that are tethered to a fully active IL-2, by protease-cleavable linkers. We show that the inactivation domain prevented IL-2 from binding to its receptors in non-tumor tissues, thereby minimizing the toxicity associated with systemic exposure to IL-2. The half-life extension element improves the pharmacokinetic profile of WTX-124 over free IL-2, allowing for greater exposure. WTX-124 was preferentially activated in tumor tissue by tumor-associated proteases, releasing active IL-2 in the tumor microenvironment. In vitro assays confirmed that the activity of WTX-124 was dependent on proteolytic activation, and in vivo WTX-124 treatment resulted in complete rejection of established tumors in a cleavage-dependent manner. Mechanistically, WTX-124 treatment triggered the activation of T cells and natural killer cells, and markedly shifted the immune activation profile of the tumor microenvironment, resulting in significant inhibition of tumor growth in syngeneic tumor models. Collectively, these data demonstrate that WTX-124 minimizes the toxicity of IL-2 treatment in the periphery while retaining the full pharmacology of IL-2 in the tumor microenvironment, supporting its further development as a cancer immunotherapy treatment.","output":"Discovery of a Conditionally Activated Interleukin-2 that Promotes Anti-tumor Immunity and Induces Tumor Regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this publication is to compile a summary of the findings regarding punicalagin in various tissues described thus far in the literature, with an emphasis on the effect of this substance on immune reactions.

Unemployment of the educated labor force often results in a waste of human capital and leads to serious economic and social problems. In the face of the impact of COVID-19, the Chinese government quickly introduced a series of employment policies for college graduates to relieve their employment pressure and create opportunities of career development. How did these employment policies for college graduates spread rapidly under the unconventional state of the COVID-19 epidemic? What are the diffusion characteristics? What are the core issues and measures? What are the differences between governments at all levels? These problems with rich connotation and research value needed to be further clarified. Based on the 72 employment support policies collected from the Chinese government network, this paper conducted a text analysis of the policies and found that in the process dimension, the employment policies of college graduates accumulated and exploded from bottom to top in the short term, and the policies diffusion followed the gradual model of eastCmiddleCwest. In the content dimension, there were five core issues: financial subsidies, innovation and entrepreneurship to drive employment, public institutions to absorb, optimizing public services, and lowering the support threshold. Meanwhile, there were obvious differences in the choice of policy tools, policy intensity, and implementation ideas in each region.

Physical activity and structured exercise have a beneficial impact on cardiometabolic risk and ameliorate mental health symptomology and cognition. This protocol describes a feasibility study for a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention among inpatients with SMI, to improve their physical and mental health. METHODS: The feasibility study follows a two-part design owing to COVID-19-related adaptations to project design: (a) a non-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 12 weeks of bicycle-based HIIT, delivered twice weekly in a face-to-face, one-to-one setting, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) and (b) a naturalistic study of inpatient HIIT; eligible participants will be invited to two sessions of HIIT per week, delivered by the research team remotely or in person. Additionally, participants in the naturalistic study may use the bike to conduct self-directed sessions of their chosen length and intensity. We will measure the feasibility and acceptability of the HIIT intervention as primary outcomes, alongside secondary and tertiary outcomes evaluating the physical, mental and cognitive effects of HIIT. The study aims to recruit 40 patients to the RCT and 6C8 patients to the naturalistic design. DISCUSSION: Exercise is a modifiable lifestyle barrier that can reverse cardiometabolic disease risk. If HIIT is found to be feasible and acceptable in inpatients with SMI, there would be scope for large-scale work to evaluate the clinical, cost and implementation effectiveness of HIIT in inpatient mental health settings.

The 14th of March, the Spanish government declared the State of Emergency. Urgent reorganization was required to give answers to the needs of this new illness. The number of patients admitted grew exponentially and resources were insufficient to care for such a number of people at home. The Hospital at Home (HaH) was called to transform a hotel into a medicalized healthcare space. The Medicalized Hotel wanted to solve three needs: grouping patients, providing more beds and allowing the isolation. Current health policy emphasizes on patient experience as one of the key components of quality of care. Patients must be involved in decision-making about their heath situation and treatment in order to provide an integrated healthcare. Analyzing patients' experience will provide knowledge and will allow finding out if the Medicalized Hotel was a good alternative. Aim: To assess the patient experience during hospital admission in a Medicalized Hotel for COVID-19, from 25th March to 15th May, and variables that may influence these experiences. Methods: Observational and descriptive study with a cross-sectional design. The study population (n=517) consisted of patients admitted in Medicalized Hotel who met inclusion criteria. Patient experience collected by the Picker Patient Experience questionnaire, PPE-15 (translated to Catalan and Spanish) and four open questions analyzed in a qualitative way. Other variables: Socio-demographic and review clinical records. Results: 427 patients (83% of admitted) answered the questionnaire (52% male, 55 yrs (63%)). Main results: being treated with respect and dignity (95%), receiving similar information from different professionals (84%) and getting understanding answers by doctors and nurses (79%, 86%). 52% of participants identified no areas for improvement and &lt;25% of improvement areas were related to food quality and communication difficulties, due to pandemic isolation measures. These contributions enhanced in: creating a clean and dirty area;improve the welcome material reception and documented information on discharge;activities for patients, such as a library, app and mobiles. Conclusions: The Medicalized Hotel, led by the HaH team, was a safe and effective alternative to acute hospital care. Grouping patients together increased HaH's effectiveness and prevented the Hospital's collapse during pandemia. Patients' experiences have been highly positive and contributed to form the medicalized hotel. With further validation, this study may be used by health professionals and organizations to improve healthcare and enhance patient experience.","output":"Patient's Experiences in a Medicalized Hotel for Covid-19 Acute Care Support.

While stories of people fleeing quarantined areas soon made national headlines, the international news was suddenly reporting of coronavirus patients connected to Italy all around the world. Against this background, Italian social media started thriving with Covid-19 humour. On 9 March the lockdown turned nationwide and became one of the strictest in Europe. This article addresses everyday memes of quarantined Italy as an instance of mundane memetics at a time of crisis. It investigates the leading discourses emerging from these memes to provide insight into the political culture that surfaces at the intersection between the ordinary of everyday social media uses and the extraordinary of crisis events. We combined digital methods and netnographic techniques to generate and analyse a dataset of over 9,000 Covid-19 memetic instances produced on Twitter by Italian publics during the first national lockdown. Our findings show that in early everyday pandemic memes the political stake did not manifest itself in the explicitness of values, attitudes, and knowledge tightly packaged in a purposeful and self-aware political culture. It rather surfaced in the form of a mundane political culture C one that was primarily performative, irrespective of any future political action, and marked by populist values.

Stationary EEG is required to reliably apply the index algorithms. Because of rapid physiological changes, artefacts, etc., the EEG may not always fulfil this requirement. EEG analysis using permutation entropy (PeEn) may overcome this issue, since PeEn can also be applied to practically nonstationary EEG. One objective was to determine the duration of EEG sequences that can be considered stationary at different anaesthetic levels. The second, more important objective was to test the reliability of PeEn to reflect the anaesthetic levels for short EEG segments. EEG was recorded from 15 volunteers undergoing sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia at different anaesthetic levels and for each group 10 data sets were included. EEG stationarity was evaluated for EEG sample lengths from 4 to 116 s for each level. PeEn was calculated for these sequences using different parameter settings and analysis windows from 2 to 60 s. During wakefulness EEG can only be considered stationary for sequences up to 12 s. With increasing anaesthetic level the probability and duration of stationary EEG increases. PeEn is able to reliably separate consciousness from unconsciousness for EEG segments as short as 2 s. Especially during wakefulness a conflict between stationary EEG sequence durations and methods used for monitoring may exist. PeEn does not require stationarity and functions for EEG sequences as short as 2 s.

METHODS: Patients included in the prospectively maintained ENEIDA registry who received at least one intravenous dose of ustekinumab due to active UC [Partial Mayo Score (PMS) >2] were included. Clinical activity and effectiveness were defined based on PMS. Short-term response was assessed at week 16. RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were included. At week 16, 53% of patients had response (including 35% of patients in remission). In the multivariate analysis, elevated serum C-reactive protein was the only variable significantly associated with lower likelihood of achieving remission. Remission was achieved in 39% and 33% of patients at weeks 24 and 52, respectively. Thirty-six percent of patients discontinued the treatment with ustekinumab during a median follow-up of 31 weeks.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 741 patients with UTI treated at the Chongqing Medical University Affiliated Children's Hospital between 2015 and 2020. Patients with and without urological malformations were compared using propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most common causative microorganism of UTI, accounting for 40.5% of infections. One hundred twenty-two patients (16.5%) had urological malformations. PSM identified 122 matched pairs of patients with or without urological malformations. The proportion of patients with UTI caused by atypical microorganisms was significantly higher in patients with urological malformations (P = 0.048).

We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. RESULTS: On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past 5 y. CONCLUSIONS: The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (defined as either aged &#8805;70 years, or younger with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals. Our national estimates broadly support the use of Global Burden of Disease modelled estimates in other countries. We provide age- and region- stratified prevalence for each condition to support effective modelling of public health interventions and planning of vaccine resource allocation. The high prevalence of health conditions among older age groups suggests that age-targeted vaccination strategies may efficiently target individuals at higher risk of severe COVID-19.","output":"UK prevalence of underlying conditions which increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease: a point prevalence study using electronic health records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: and Objectives: The emergent Covid-19 disease with conspicuous prevalence is putting the healthcare workers' job security at risk. The preventive behaviors in every individual have a close relationship with his/her risk perception of the risk factor. Hence the present study has been undertaken aiming at determining the Iranian healthcare workers' risk perception of the Covid-19 disease and the relevant effective factors. Materials: and Methods: This anonymous online survey was conducted in March-April, 2020 using targeted snowball sampling among the Iranian healthcare workers. The data was collected via online-social networks using a questionnaire containing demographical specifications (5 questions), risk perceptions (20 questions), with five sub-scales including cognitive, cultural, political, social and emotional factors. Data analysis was performed using SPSS v.16 software. Results: : From 165 participants, the youth (20-49 years of age) with 84% and the females with 60% constituted the majority of participants. The average risk perception score of the healthcare workers was 66.438.17. The Spearman correlation coefficient showed the significant direct relationship between the risk perception score and all the sub-scales at 0.01 significance level. The political and cultural factors had the highest correlation with the personnel risk perception (r > 0.75). Conclusion: Health workers did not have an excellent risk perception of the emergent Covid-19 disease.

Some of these variants initially identified in caged were also found in humans. The claim that these variants exhibited lower susceptibility to antibody neutralization led to the slaughter of 17 million minks in Denmark. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence tests led to the discovery of infected farmed minks worldwide. In this study, we revisit the issue of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants in minks as a model of sarbecovirus interspecies evolution by: (1) comparing human and mink angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) receptors; (2) comparing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from humans and minks; (3) analyzing the impact of mutations on the 3D structure of the spike protein; and (4) predicting linear epitope targets for immune response. Mink-selected SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the Y453F/D614G mutations display an increased affinity for human ACE2 and can escape neutralization by one monoclonal antibody. However, they are unlikely to lose most of the major epitopes predicted to be targets for neutralizing antibodies.

METHODS We retrospectively describe eight EVALI patients with different presentations, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment and concomitant diagnoses. We review the literature and describe how our analysis adds to the literature. FINDINGS Eight males, aged 15-18 years of age presented with various symptoms. Four patients were Caucasian while four were of Hispanic origin. All patients presented with respiratory symptoms; six also had GI symptoms; five were hypoxemic; all but one patient admitted to using products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). All patients had changes on imaging with ground glass opacities. One patient underwent lung biopsy and bronchoscopy showing eosinophilic pneumonia. All patients received anti-microbial therapies without improvement until systemic steroids were administered. Six patients underwent pulmonary function testing, and five required medications for newly diagnosed persistent asthma. One patient developed pulmonary hypertension, which resolved after treatment. One patient required non-invasive ventilation. No patients were positive for SARS-CoV2. Two had co-infections with other microbes. Five patients required escalation of asthma therapies at follow up with pulmonology. CONCLUSION This analysis of eight adolescent males hospitalized for EVALI highlights the unpredictable spectrum of disease presentation and management. These patients can be misdiagnosed without proper screening and may have residual respiratory complications necessitating outpatient management by a pulmonologist.

Primary outcomes evaluated were postoperative complications, readmissions, reoperations, and mortality within 30 days of operation. Secondary outcomes included hospital resource utilization, hospital length of stay, and postoperative oxygen support. RESULTS: A total of 66 children with preoperative confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated with median age of 9.5 years (interquartile range (IQR) 5-14) with 65% male and 70% Hispanic White. Sixty-five percent of patients had no comorbidities, with abdominal pain identified as the most common preoperative symptom (65%). Twenty-three percent of patients presented with no COVID-19 related symptoms. Eighty-two percent of patients had no preoperative chest imaging and 98% of patients did not receive preoperative oxygen support. General pediatric surgeons performed the majority of procedures (68%) with the most common diagnosis appendicitis (47%).

T(2)-corrected peak areas were calculated. Phantom data were used to validate the model. Human data were used in the model to determine the complete liver fat spectrum. In the fat-water emulsion phantom, the spectrum predicted by the model (based on known fatty acid chain distribution) agreed closely with spectroscopic measurement. In human subjects, areas of CH(2) peaks at 2.1 and 1.3 ppm were linearly correlated (slope, 0.172; r = 0.991), as were the 0.9 ppm CH(3) and 1.3 ppm CH(2) peaks (slope, 0.125; r = 0.989). The 2.75 ppm CH(2) peak represented 0.6% of the total fat signal in high-liver-fat subjects. These values predict that 8.6% of the total fat signal overlies the water peak.

PURPOSE: Cost-avoidance studies of pharmacist interventions are common and often the first type of study conducted by investigators to quantify the economic impact of clinical pharmacy services. The purpose of this primer is to provide guidance for conducting cost-avoidance studies pertaining to clinical pharmacy practice. SUMMARY: Cost-avoidance studies represent a paradigm conceptually different from traditional pharmacoeconomic analysis. A cost-avoidance study reports on cost savings from a given intervention, where the savings is estimated based on a counterfactual scenario. Investigators need to determine what specifically would have happened to the patient if the intervention did not occur. This assessment can be fundamentally flawed, depending on underlying assumptions regarding the pharmacists' action and the patient trajectory. It requires careful identification of the potential consequence of nonaction, as well as probability and cost assessment. Given the uncertainty of assumptions, sensitivity analyses should be performed. A step-by-step methodology, formula for calculations, and best practice guidance is provided. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-avoidance studies focused on pharmacist interventions should be considered low-level evidence. These studies are acceptable to provide pilot data for the planning of future clinical trials. The guidance provided in this article should be followed to improve the quality and validity of such investigations.","output":"Proposed guidance on cost-avoidance studies in pharmacy practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment (WLST) is derived by a conclusion that further treatment will not enable a patient to survive or will not produce a functional outcome with acceptable quality of life that the patient and the treating team regard as beneficial. Although many hospitalized patients die under such circumstances, controlled donation after the circulatory determination of death (cDCDD) programs have been developed only in a reduced number of countries. This International Collaborative Statement aims at expanding cDCDD in the world to help countries progress towards self-sufficiency in transplantation and offer more patients the opportunity of organ donation. The Statement addresses three fundamental aspects of the cDCDD pathway. First, it describes the process of determining a prognosis that justifies the WLST, a decision that should be prior to and independent of any consideration of organ donation and in which transplant professionals must not participate. Second, the Statement establishes the permanent cessation of circulation to the brain as the standard to determine death by circulatory criteria. Death may be declared after an elapsed observation period of 5 min without circulation to the brain, which confirms that the absence of circulation to the brain is permanent. Finally, the Statement highlights the value of perfusion repair for increasing the success of cDCDD organ transplantation. cDCDD protocols may utilize either in situ or ex situ perfusion consistent with the practice of each country. Methods to accomplish the in situ normothermic reperfusion of organs must preclude the restoration of brain perfusion to not invalidate the determination of death.

The in vitro three-dimensional (3D) culture system of organoids is well known, however, these 3D systems are both costly and difficult to culture and maintain. As such, less expensive, faster and less complex methods to maintain 3D cell culture models would complement the use of organoids. Chick embryos have been used as a model to study human biology for centuries, with many fundamental discoveries as a result. These include cell type induction, cell competence, plasticity and contact inhibition, which indicates the relevance of using chick embryos when studying developmental biology and disease mechanisms. RESULTS: Here, we present an updated protocol that enables time efficient, cost effective and long-term expansion of fetal organ spheroids (FOSs) from chick embryos. Utilizing this protocol, we generated FOSs in an anchorage-independent growth pattern from seven different organs, including brain, lung, heart, liver, stomach, intestine and epidermis. These three-dimensional (3D) structures recapitulate many cellular and structural aspects of their in vivo counterpart organs and serve as a useful developmental model. In addition, we show a functional application of FOSs to analyze cell-cell interaction and cell invasion patterns as observed in cancer. CONCLUSION: The establishment of a broad ranging and highly effective method to generate FOSs from different organs was successful in terms of the formation of healthy, proliferating 3D organ spheroids that exhibited organ-like characteristics. Potential applications of chick FOSs are their use in studies of cell-to-cell contact, cell fusion and tumor invasion under defined conditions. Future studies will reveal whether chick FOSs also can be applicable in scientific areas such as viral infections, drug screening, cancer diagnostics and/or tissue engineering.

In order to improve the traceability of their trade, we developed 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci for the white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), the species most frequently found on African bushmeat markets. We genotyped 24 white-bellied pangolins from the Douala market, Cameroon, originating from the Ebo forest c. 75 km north-east of Douala. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 12 (mean = 6.95), and mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.592 (0.208C0.875) and 0.671 (0.469C0.836), respectively. Genetic diversity was higher than that cross-estimated from microsatellite loci developed for other species of pangolins. Two loci deviated from HardyCWeinberg equilibrium and two loci showed linkage disequilibrium. Genetic variance (PCoA) was increased with the addition of 13 pangolins of unknown origin, possibly suggesting that the Douala market is fed from differentiated source populations of white-bellied pangolins. Each of the 37 individuals had a unique multilocus genotype. The unbiased probability of identity (uPI) and the probability of identity among siblings (PIsibs) were both very low (uPI = 8.443 e?21; PIsibs = 1.011 e?07). Only five microsatellite loci were needed to reach the conservative value of PIsibs < 0.01, overall indicating a powerful discriminating power of our combined loci.

However, information needs of patients and their relatives for ACP are unknown. The aim of this study is to explore information needs of patients with chronic disease and their relatives for web-based ACP. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients with chronic diseases and relatives at their home or at the study center. In three cases, the patient and relative were paired since they preferred to be interviewed together. We asked about information they would search for when to start with ACP, where they would search for information, what search terms they would use on the Internet, and what content and information they would consider important on an ACP website. The interviewer asked participants to clarify their responses during the interview. We used thematic analysis to analyze the interviewees' responses. RESULTS: We interviewed nine patients with different chronic diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and kidney diseases, and seven relatives, namely partners or (adult) children. The interviewees were aged 24 to 80 years, nine were female and seven were male. Both patients with a chronic disease and relatives mentioned comparable information needs.

Not every suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of people sheltering in place. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report COVID-19-like symptoms and behaviors. METHODS: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19-related symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and whether they traveled outside of their local area. RESULTS: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a 3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3% of the responses from the United States and 32.0% from Japan. Of the total respondents, 19,631 (22.3%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19. Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1%) reported more than one COVID-19-like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7% vs 21.5%; P<.001). Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19 testing rates (R2=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at scale and with populations that are older than those found through social media platforms. Such platforms could enable epidemiologists and researchers to quickly assess trends in emerging infections potentially before at-risk populations present to clinics and hospitals for testing and/or treatment.","output":"Capturing COVID-19-Like Symptoms at Scale Using Banner Ads on an Online News Platform: Pilot Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study was designed to explore the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and related influencing factors for asymptomatic patients with positive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid test.

The patients were assigned to an asymptomatic group and a symptomatic group according to the existence of clinical symptoms when they got positive result in nucleic acid test, and the clinical data of the two groups were analyzed and compared. In addition, the data of asymptomatic patients who showed clinical symptoms later and the results of two-week follow-up after cure were analyzed. RESULTS Among all enrolled patients, there were 1489 patients with positive symptoms and 79 asymptomatic patients, including 34 patients who developed symptoms during treatment. Logistic analysis revealed that age 45 years (OR=2.722, P<0.001), history of diabetes mellitus (OR=0.446, P=0.007), and history of cancer (OR=0.259, P=0.008) were independent factors for asymptomatic presentation in patients with positive SNAT, and age 46 years (OR=1.562, P=0.012) and history of hypertension (OR=2.077, P<0.001) were risk factors for the occurrence of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic patients with positive SNAT during hospitalization.

The binding free energy of the protein-ligand complexes were estimated, pharmacophore models were generated and the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the compounds were determined. The compounds displayed various levels of binding affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 drug targets. Bisimidazole C2 scored highest against all the targets, with its aromatic rings including the two imidazole groups contributing to the binding.

The clinical characteristics of patients with advanced emphysema and chronic bronchitis have not been well described. METHODS Patients randomized to medical therapy in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial were grouped based on their reports of cough and phlegm on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire(SGRQ) at baseline: chronic bronchitis(CB+) and no chronic bronchitis(CB-). The patients were similarly categorized into severe chronic bronchitis(SCB+) or no severe chronic bronchitis (SCB-) based on the above definition plus report of chest trouble. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the relationships between chronic bronchitis and severe chronic bronchitis and survival and time to hospitalization. Lung function and SGRQ scores over time were compared between groups. RESULTS The CB+(N = 234; 38%) and CB- groups(N = 376; 62%) had similar survival (median 60.8 versus 65.7 months, p = 0.19) and time to hospitalization (median 26.9 versus 24.9 months, p = 0.84). The SCB+ group(N = 74; 12%) had worse survival (median 47.7 versus 65.7 months, p = 0.02) and shorter time to hospitalization (median 18.5 versus 26.7 months, p = 0.02) than the SCB- group (N = 536; 88%). Mortality and hospitalization rates were not increased when chest trouble was analyzed by itself. The CB+ and CB-groups had similar lung function and SGRQ scores over time. The SCB+ and SCB-groups had similar lung function over time, but the SCB+ group had significantly worse SGRQ scores.

Two multicenter prospective cohort studies in the United States and Finland used the same protocol to enroll children aged <2 years hospitalized for bronchiolitis and collect nasopharyngeal aspirates. By using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, patients were classified into 3 genomic load status groups: low, intermediate, and high. Outcome measures were a length of hospital stay (LOS) of 3 days and intensive care use, defined as admission to the intensive care unit or use of mechanical ventilation. Results. Of 2615 enrolled children, 1764 (67%) had RSV bronchiolitis. Children with a low genomic load had a higher unadjusted risk of having a length of stay of 3 days (52%), compared with children with intermediate and those with high genomic loads (42% and 51%, respectively). In a multivariable model, the risk of having a length of stay of 3 days remained significantly higher in the groups with intermediate (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20C1.69) and high (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.29C1.94) genomic loads.

METHODS: To that end, a staggered irradiation cycle has been applied which included dose rate values from 0.81 to 4.87 cGy/s, achieving a total absorbed dose of 21.4 Gy. The samples have been irradiated with a linear accelerator and the relations between the induced photocurrent and the average and instantaneous dose rates, and between the accumulated charge and the absorbed dose, have been determined. The radiation-induced output currents were measured by means of an external interface of the devices to a previously designed readout unit. RESULTS: Experimental results of Si PIN photodiode BPW34S have shown a sensitivity of (13.9  0.5) nC/cGy, slight sensitivity dependence on dose rate, and a high linearity of the current with the average and instantaneous dose rate, requiring only 10 V of reverse bias voltage. This device thermal drift has characterized and modelled for temperature effect compensation.

This study aimed to survey the impact of the coronavirus on the poultry supply chain using an exploratory sequential mixed design. We first addressed those stages of the poultry supply chain disrupted in an ongoing pandemic, and then elaborated particular disturbances associated with each stage. This study was based on data collected from Iranian poultry industry owners and experts who had sufficient experience in agricultural supply chains as well. As the qualitative phase, the content analysis was conducted to identify the impacts of the coronavirus on the poultry supply chain. The results and conclusions that emerged from the qualitative phase were refined and weighted by the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) respectively, in the quantitative phase. The results suggested that the pandemic has further affected the input supply as a stage in the poultry supply chain. This is probably because of the fact that the poultry industry is heavily dependent on inputs' flow. In addition, supply chain governance was seriously impaired due to the persistence of the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic has significantly affected the stages that are most reliant on transportation. Finally, we found that a part of the disruptions that occur in the downstream of the supply chain is due to the epidemic's direct adverse effects, and another part is due to indirect consequences received from the upstream.

Vaccination levels among workers in many such settings remain markedly lower than those of residents and members of surrounding communities. The situation is troubling because prison staff are a key vector for COVID-19 transmission. OBJECTIVE: To assess patterns and timing of staff vaccination in California state prisons and identify individual-level and community-level factors associated with remaining unvaccinated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from December 22, 2020, through June 30, 2021, to quantify the fractions of staff and incarcerated residents who remained unvaccinated among 23 472 custody and 7617 health care staff who worked in roles requiring direct contact with residents at 33 of the 35 prisons operated by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Multivariable probit regressions assessed demographic, community, and peer factors associated with staff vaccination uptake. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Remaining unvaccinated throughout the study period. RESULTS: Of 23 472 custody staff, 3751 (16%) were women, and 1454 (6%) were Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, 1571 (7%) Black individuals, 9008 (38%) Hispanic individuals, and 6666 (28%) White individuals. Of 7617 health care staff, 5434 (71%) were women, and 2148 (28%) were Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, 1201 (16%) Black individuals, 1409 (18%) Hispanic individuals, and 1771 (23%) White individuals.

By June 30, 2021, 14 317 custody staff (61%) and 2819 health care staff (37%) remained unvaccinated. In adjusted analyses, remaining unvaccinated was positively associated with younger age (custody staff: age, 18-29 years vs 60 years, 75% [95% CI, 73%-76%] vs 45% [95% CI, 42%-48%]; health care staff: 52% [95% CI, 48%-56%] vs 29% [95% CI, 27%-32%]), prior COVID-19 infection (custody staff: 67% [95% CI, 66%-68%] vs 59% [95% CI, 59%-60%]; health care staff: 44% [95% CI, 42%-47%] vs 36% [95% CI, 36%-36%]), residing in a community with relatively low rates of vaccination (custody staff: 75th vs 25th percentile:, 63% [95% CI, 62%-63%] vs 60% [95% CI, 59%-60%]; health care staff: 40% [95% CI, 39%-41%] vs 34% [95% CI, 33%-35%]), and sharing shifts with coworkers who had relatively low rates of vaccination (custody staff: 75th vs 25th percentile, 64% [95% CI, 62%-66%] vs 59% [95% CI, 57%-61%]; health care staff: 38% [95% CI, 36%-41%] vs 35% [95% CI, 31%-39%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of California state prison custody and health care staff found that vaccination uptake plateaued at levels that posed ongoing risks of further outbreaks in the prisons and continuing transmission from prisons to surrounding communities.

Neither method provided any evidence that the GAV sgmRNAs are fused to genomic 5'-leader RNA sequences as is the case with vertebrate coronaviruses and arteriviruses.

The identification of only two sgmRNAs that initiate at the same position in conserved intergenic sequences and the absence of 5'-genomic leader sequences fused to these sgmRNAs confirms that GAV has few genes and suggests that it utilizes a transcription mechanism possibly similar to the vertebrate toroviruses but distinct from coronaviruses and arteriviruses.","output":"Gill-associated nidovirus of Penaeus monodon prawns transcribes 3'-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that do not possess 5'-leader sequences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants of concern for SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to have differential infectivity and pathogenicity. Difference in recovery patterns across these variants and the interaction with vaccination status has not been reported in population-based studies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to study the length of stay and temporal trends in RT-PCR cycle times (Ct) across alpha and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. METHODS: Participants consisted of patients admitted to national COVID-19 treatment facilities if they had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, and analysis of variants was performed (using whole genome sequencing). Information on vaccination status, age, sex, cycle times (Ct) for four consecutive RT-PCR tests conducted during hospital stay, and total length of hospital stay for each participant were ascertained from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Patients infected with the delta variant were younger (mean age = 35years vs 39 years for alpha, p<0.001) and had lesser vaccination coverage (54% vs 72% for alpha, p<0.001). RT-PCR Ct values were similar for both variants at the baseline test; however by the fourth test, delta variant patients had significantly lower Ct values (27 vs 29, p=0.05). Length of hospital stay was higher in delta variant patients in vaccinated (3 days vs 2.9 days for alpha variant) as well as in unvaccinated patients (5.2 days vs 4.4 days for alpha variant, p<0.001). Hazards of hospital discharge after adjusting for vaccination status, age, and sex was higher for alpha variant infections (HR=1.2, 95% CI: 1.01C1.41, p=0.029). CONCLUSION: Patients infected with the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 were found to have a slower recovery as indicated by longer length of stay and higher shedding of the virus compared to alpha variant infections, and this trend was consistent in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.","output":"COVID-19 Recovery Patterns Across Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) Variants of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"March Mammal Madness is a science outreach project that, over the course of several weeks in March, reaches hundreds of thousands of people in the United States every year.

Furthermore, we determined the survival of the strain throughout the gastrointestinal tract under simulated conditions. The PY yogurt had a lower extent of proteolysis index and a higher depth of proteolysis index. These results indicate that the proteolytic enzymes of L. mucosae may have a possible action in PY. The PY formulation exhibited viscosity almost 1.5 times as high as CY over the refrigeration period, probably due to higher production of exopolysaccharides by the probiotic strain, which directly interferes with the microstructure, texture, and viscosity of the product. The PY formulation received higher scores for color, flavor, and global acceptance at 1 d of storage and higher texture scores at 28 d. The counts of L. mucosae remained high (>7 log cfu/g and >8.5 log cfu/g) throughout mouth-ileum digestion and storage, respectively, in PY.

Surface technologies that control pathogen transfer can help control fomite transmission and are of great interest to public health. Here, we report a novel bead transfer method for evaluating fomite transmission in common laboratory settings. We show that this method meets several important criteria for quantitative test methods, including reasonableness, relevancy, resemblance, responsiveness, and repeatability, and therefore may be adaptable for standardization. In addition, this method can be applied to a wide variety of pathogens including bacteria, phage, and human viruses. Using the bead transfer method, we demonstrate that an engineered micropattern limits transfer of Staphylococcus aureus by 97.8% and T4 bacteriophage by 93.0% on silicone surfaces. Furthermore, the micropattern significantly reduces transfer of influenza B virus and human coronavirus on silicone and polypropylene surfaces. Our results highlight the potential of using surface texture as a valuable new strategy in combating infectious diseases. Disease transmission often occurs through contact with contaminated surfaces, called fomites. Efforts to reduce this method of fomite transmission include surface cleaning, personal hygiene, alteration of habits, and novel technologies to reduce pathogen spread. This manuscript presents a novel method for the consistent contamination of surfaces to mimic the transmission of pathogens via fomites. Using this method, we present a surface texture modeled on shark skin that significantly reduces the transfer of a variety of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, influenza B virus, and human coronavirus 229E.

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 by itself is not an indication for cesarean section. Different publications demonstrated the efficacy of neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia for delivery. Although SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a certain neurotropism, neuraxial block was not associated with neurological damage in COVID-19 parturients, and seems as safe and effective as in normal situations. It permits to avoid a general anesthesia in case of intrapartum cesarean section. Epidural failure is a concern: it may lead to a general anesthesia in case of emergency cesarean section. Local protocols and well-trained anesthesiologists will be helpful. COVID-19 patients require special circuits and every step (transfer to and from theatre, recovery, analgesia, and so on) should be planned in advance. For cesarean section under general anesthesia, personal protection equipment must be enhanced. Postoperative analgesia with neuraxial opioids, NSAIDs, or regional blocks are recommended. COVID-19 and pregnancy increase the risk of thrombosis, so thromboprophylaxis has to be considered and protocolized.

Laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome and repeated transjugular/ transhepatic interventional and open surgical thrombectomy procedures were performed. Additional therapy consisted of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator over 5 days, anticoagulation (argatroban), platelet inhibition (Acetylsalicylic acid /clopidogrel), immunoglobulins and steroids. Results This aggressive treatment included 5 laparotomies and 4 angiographic interventions, open abdomen for 8 days, transfusion of 27 units of packed red cells, 9 abdominal and 4 cerebral CT scans, thrombolysis therapy for 5 days, mechanical ventilation for 15 days, and an ICU stay of 25 days.

Hyperinflammation and multiple organ failure comprise the main clinical features of a cytokine storm. Nrf2 is a transcription factor which regulates the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory processes. Furthermore, Nrf2, as a master regulator, controls the activity of NF-B which binds to the promoter of many pro-inflammatory genes inducible of various inflammatory factors. Inhibition of Nrf2 response was recently demonstrated in biopsies from patients with COVID-19, and Nrf2 agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication across cell lines in vitro. Glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products have excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects via the Nrf2 activation pathway, reduction in the NF-B activation, and subsequent reduced cytokines levels. CONCLUSION: Accordingly, these compounds can be helpful in combating the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.

Health systems have this data in their electronic health records (EHR) systems and often have a greater capacity for outreach. Clearly, a partnership is needed. However, successful collaborations will require public health to change from its historical hierarchical information supply chain model to an ecosystem model with a peer-to-peer exchange with population health providers.

In vitro studies have shown that SALPs inhibit entry of HCV without cell toxicity. EXPERT OPINION SALPs prevent viral infection in cell culture model systems. Treatment studies of established HCV infection in cell culture models as well as proof-of-concept and safety studies in animal models are needed to evaluate their potential for drug development.

There are about ten lineages of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including Chloroplastida, Rhodophyta, and Cryptophyta. Mechanistically, eukaryotic photosynthesis arose via a symbiotic merger between a host eukaryote and either a cyanobacterial or eukaryotic photosymbiont. There are, however, many aspects of this major evolutionary transition that remain unsettled.

Such an assumption could lead to confusion or unrealistic interpretation of discordant genomic and phenotypic data. Here, we propose that the free-living ancestors to the plastids may have originated from a diversified lineage of cyanobacteria that were prone to symbioses, akin to some modern-day algae such as the Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates and Chlorella-related algae that associate with a number of unrelated host eukaryotes. This scenario, which assumes the plurality of ancestral form, better explains relatively minor but important differences that are observed in the genomes of modern-day eukaryotic algal species.

Apart from standard hygiene measures, cohorting of RSV-infected patients separately from RSV-negative patients is frequently applied to prevent cross-infection, although evidence to support this practice is lacking. The objective is to evaluate the risk of room sharing between RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study in children < 2 years hospitalised with acute bronchiolitis. During the first day of admission, patients shared one room, pending results of virological diagnosis (PCR). When diagnostic results were available, RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients were separated. Standard hygienic measures (gowns, gloves, masks, hand washing) were used in all patients. RESULTS: We included 48 patients (83% RSV-positive). Co-infection was found in nine patients at admission, and two during hospitalisation (23%). The two patients with acquired co-infection had been nursed in a single room during the entire admission. None of 37 patients sharing a room with other bronchiolitis patients (20 with patients with a different virus) were co-infected during admission. Disease severity in co-infection was not worse than in mono-infection. CONCLUSION: One in five patients with bronchiolitis was co-infected, but co-infection acquired during admission was rare and was not associated with more severe disease. Room sharing between RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients (on the first day of admission) did not influence the risk of co-infection, suggesting that cohorting of RSV-infected patients separate from non-RSV-infected patients may not be indicated.","output":"Co-Infections in Children Hospitalised for Bronchiolitis: Role of Roomsharing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The tackle is the most common in-play event in rugby union and rugby league (the rugby codes). It is also associated with the greatest propensity for injury and thus accounts for the most injuries in the sport. It is therefore of critical importance to accurately quantify how tackle technique alters injury risk using gold-standard methodology of three-dimensional motion (3D) capture. OBJECTIVE To examine the 3D motion capture methodology of rugby-style tackle techniques to provide recommendations to inform practice for future rugby code research and advance the knowledge of this field. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS Articles published in English language, up to May 2020, were retrieved via nine online databases. All cross-sectional, correlational, observational, and cohort study designs using 3D motion capture of tackle techniques in rugby code players met inclusion criteria for this review. A qualitative synthesis using thematic analysis was pre-specified to identify five key themes. RESULTS Seven articles met eligibility criteria. Participant demographic information (theme one) involved a total of 92 rugby union players, ranging in skill level and playing experience. Experimental task design information (theme two) included one-on-one, front-on (n=5) or side-on (n=1) contact between a tackler and a ball carrier, or a tackler impacting a tackle bag or bump pad (n=3). 3D data collection (theme three) reported differing sampling frequencies and marker sets. 3D data reduction and analysis (theme four) procedures could be mostly replicated, but the definitions of temporal events, joint modelling and filtering varied between studies. Findings of the studies (theme five) showed that the one-on-one tackle technique can be altered (n=5) when tackle height, leg drive and/or tackle speed is modified. A study reported tackle coaching intervention. CONCLUSIONS This is the first review to evaluate 3D motion capture of rugby-style tackle technique research. A research framework was identified: (i) participant demographic information, (ii) experimental task design information, (iii) 3D motion capture data specifications, and (iv) 3D data reduction and analysis.

BCG also stimulates an anti-tumour immune response, which urologists have harnessed for the treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. A growing body of evidence indicates that BCG offers protection against various non-mycobacterial and viral infections. The non-specific effects of BCG occur via the induction of trained immunity and form the basis for the hypothesis that BCG vaccination could be used to protect against the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The host immunity of COVID-19 patients is unknown.METHODSThe routine laboratory tests and host immunity in COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness were compared after patient admission.RESULTSA total of 65 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were classified as having mild (n = 30), severe (n = 20), and extremely severe (n = 15) illness. Many routine laboratory tests, such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer, were increased in severe and extremely severe patients. The absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells were gradually decreased with increased severity of illness. The activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD45RO expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased in severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The costimulatory molecule CD28 had opposite results. The percentage of natural Tregs was decreased in extremely severe patients. The percentage of IFN-?3-producing CD8+ T cells was increased in both severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The percentage of IFN-?3-producing CD4+ T cells was increased in extremely severe patients. IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10 were all increased in extremely severe patients. The activation of DC and B cells was decreased in extremely severe patients.CONCLUSIONThe number and function of T cells are inconsistent in COVID-19 patients. The hyperfunction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is associated with the pathogenesis of extremely severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.FUNDINGThis work was funded by the National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (2017ZX10103005-007) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019kfyRCPY098).","output":"The laboratory tests and host immunity of COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An analysis of the response of highly urbanized Russian regions to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic shows that regions with a high urban population share and many small and medium-sized businesses were most vulnerable;that regional differences were largely determined by the severity of health-related restrictions on business and social activity;and the extent to which regionally differentiated economic support measures and the adoption of digital technologies, new delivery methods, and a focus on new sectors stabilized aggregate supply and demand.

Despite numerous international declarations and treaties protecting human rights, the last few decades has been fraught with reports of \\"lapses\\" in medical professionalism involving torture and force-feeding of detainees (e.g. captured during the War on Terror) and health care professionals refusing to treat infected patients (e.g. HIV and Ebola). This paper provides some historical background to the changing status of a physician's duty to treat and how medical practitioners came to be involved in the inhumane treatment of detainees during the War on Terror, culminating in reports of \\"lapses\\" in professionalism. The Theory of Planned Behavior, which takes into account the individual, the environment and the social context, is used to explain the factors that might influence an individual's behavior in challenging situations. The paper concludes with some recommendations for medical and health professions education. The recommendations include selecting students who, as a minimum, can provide evidence of \\"basic\\" professionalism, engaging them in exploring the history of the medical profession, exposing them to contexts of uncertainty and moral dilemmas and challenging them to reflect on their responses.","output":"Professionalism under fire: Conflict, war and epidemics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To present seven paediatric patients with appendicitis, all with late diagnosis resulting from different aspects of the fear from the current global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Cases were collected from three paediatric surgical wards. Comparison between complicated appendicitis rates in the COVID-19 era and similar period in previous year was performed. RESULTS: All seven children presented with complicated appendicitis. Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation. Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs 11%, P-value .06). CONCLUSION: The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common paediatric medical conditions. We believe caregivers and healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.","output":"Delayed diagnosis of paediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The basis for this hermeneutic phenomenological research was to identify common themes in women 65 years of age and older and determine whether these women felt valued in ageing.

Twelve women were interviewed from a vast range of locations throughout the United States through zoom due to COVID 19. Their responses reflect four main categories: ageism, successful ageing, active engagement, and social support. The interviews focused on seven main questions: Tell me about being your age? Is there a time you can recall when you first felt older? Have you ever felt mistreated as an older adult? Have you ever felt you were discounted or ignored as being an older woman? Have you done anything to maintain your youth? Have you done anything to feel youthful? Have you ever felt dismissed related to your age?

The study accounts for potentially spatial confounding factors related to urbanization that may have influenced the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and related COVID-19 mortality. Our epidemiological analysis uses geographical information (e.g., municipalities) and negative binomial regression to assess whether both ambient PM(2.5) concentration and excess mortality have a similar spatial distribution. Our analysis suggests a positive association of ambient PM(2.5) concentration on excess mortality in Northern Italy related to the COVID-19 epidemic. Our estimates suggest that a one-unit increase in PM(2.5) concentration (g/m(3)) is associated with a 9% (95% confidence interval: 6C12%) increase in COVID-19 related mortality.","output":"The Effects of Air Pollution on COVID-19 Related Mortality in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

The objective of this study is to analyse the perceptions of the participants in the NOS Primavera Sound festival regarding the environmental and sustainable proposals and initiatives of the organizers during the event. The data were collected in the event area (Parque da Cidade do Porto) during the three days of the festival, using non-probabilistic sampling technique for convenience. The questionnaires were applied directly and personally by the researchers. The sample analysis (n = 977) was studied using descriptive and inferential statistics, using a non-parametric test to define the characterization of the public's profile concerning the degree of importance attributed to the event's environmental practices. The results suggest that the main reasons for participating in the event (assessed on a scale of 1 to 5) were the festival's reputation (4.25), fun / socializing (4.13), previous experience (4.08) and promoted environmental practices (4.01). About environmental sustainability, the participants had an average value of 4.27 points, showing that the label of the green festival is acknowledged by the public.

This study assesses the variability of the SSB physicochemical quality in a composting facility located in a small town of Colombia, in which SSB collection was performed twice a week. Likewise, the influence of the SSB physicochemical variability on the variability of compost parameters was assessed. Parametric and non-parametric tests (i.e. Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney test) showed no significant differences in the quality parameters of SSB among collection days, and therefore, it was unnecessary to establish specific operation and maintenance regulations for each collection day. Significant variability was found in eight of the twelve quality parameters analyzed in the inlet stream, with corresponding coefficients of variation (CV) higher than 23%. The CVs for the eight parameters analyzed in the final compost (i.e. pH, moisture, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, total phosphorus, total potassium and ash) ranged from 9.6% to 49.4%, with significant variations in five of those parameters (CV>20%). The above indicate that variability in the inlet stream can affect the variability of the end-product. Results suggest the need to consider variability of the inlet stream in the performance of composting facilities to achieve a compost of consistent quality.","output":"A systematic approach to evaluate parameter consistency in the inlet stream of source separated biowaste composting facilities: A case study in Colombia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases affect human health despite advances in biomedical research and drug discovery. Among these, viruses are especially difficult to tackle due to the sudden transfer from animals to humans, high mutational rates, resistance to current treatments, and the intricacies of their molecular interactions with the host.

We then emphasize the significance of examining proteolysis within the subcellular compartment where cleavage occurs naturally. We show the power of stable expression, highlighting the usefulness of the cell-based multiplexed approach, which we have adapted to two independent assays previously developed to monitor (a) the activity of the HIV-1-encoded protease or (b) the cleavage of the HIV-1-encoded envelope protein by the host. Multiplexing was achieved by mixing cells each carrying a different assay or, alternatively, by engineering cells expressing two assays. Multiplexing relies on the robustness of the individual assays and their clear discrimination, further enhancing screening capabilities in an attempt to block proteolytic events required for viral infectivity and spread.","output":"A Single-Cell Platform for Monitoring Viral Proteolytic Cleavage in Different Cellular Compartments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 8, 2019, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, but information about children with COVID-19 is limited.

We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha. Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed until February 26th, 2020. RESULTS: By February 19, 2020, nine pediatric patients were identified as having 2019-nCoV infection in Changsha. Six children had a family exposure and could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days. The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms. Two of the enrolled patients showed small ground-glass opacity of chest computed tomography scan. As of February 26, six patients had a negative RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged.

Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19. METHODS: We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). FINDINGS: 96a??032 patients (mean age 538 years, 463% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14a??888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81a??144 patients were in the control group. 10a??698 (111%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (93%), hydroxychloroquine (180%; hazard ratio 1335, 95% CI 1223-1457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (238%; 1447, 1368-1531), chloroquine (164%; 1365, 1218-1531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (222%; 1368, 1273-1469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (03%), hydroxychloroquine (61%; 2369, 1935-2900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (81%; 5106, 4106-5983), chloroquine (43%; 3561, 2760-4596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (65%; 4011, 3344-4812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.

These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as 'Blue Carbon' ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62-72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs.

People already experiencing mental ill-health may have been especially vulnerable to disruptions. Aim: Investigate associations between pre-pandemic psychological distress and disruptions during the pandemic to (1) healthcare, economic activity, and housing, (2) cumulative disruptions and 3) whether these differ by age, sex, ethnicity or education. Methods: Data were from 59,482 participants in 12 UK longitudinal adult population surveys with data collected both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants self-reported disruptions since the start of the pandemic to: healthcare (medication access, procedures, or appointments); economic activity (negative changes in employment, income or working hours); and housing (change of address or household composition). Logistic regression models were used within each study to estimate associations between pre-pandemic psychological distress scores and disruption outcomes. Findings were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis with restricted maximum likelihood. Results: Between one to two-thirds of study participants experienced at least one disruption during the pandemic, with 2.3-33.2% experiencing disruptions in 2 or more of the 3 domains examined. One standard deviation higher pre-pandemic psychological distress was associated with: (i) increased odds of any healthcare disruptions (OR=1.30; 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.40) with fully adjusted ORs ranging from 1.33 [1.20 to 1.49] for disruptions to prescriptions or medication access and 1.24 [1.09 to 1.41] for disruption to procedures; (ii) loss of employment (OR=1.13 [1.06 to 1.21]) and income (OR=1.12 [1.06 to 1.19]) and reductions in working hours/furlough (OR=1.05 [1.00 to 1.09]); (iii) no associations with housing disruptions (OR=1.00 [0.97 to 1.03]); and (iv) increased likelihood of experiencing a disruption in at least two domains (OR=1.25 [1.18 to 1.32]) or in one domain (OR=1.11 [1.07 to 1.16]) relative to experiencing no disruption. We did not find evidence of these associations differing by sex, ethnicity, education level, or age. Conclusion: Those suffering from psychological distress before the pandemic were more likely to experience healthcare disruptions, economic disruptions related to unemployment and loss of income, and to clusters of disruptions across multiple domains during the pandemic.

There was a very strong relationship between students attitudes towards mathematics and students perceptions of their parents attitudes towards mathematics. Middle-class students reported more positive attitudes towards mathematics, more positive perceived parental attitudes towards mathematics, and had higher mathematics achievement than working-class students. Cultural capital had a significant positive effect on students attitudes towards mathematics but a minor effect on their achievement in mathematics. However, cultural capitals effect on students attitudes and achievement in mathematics faded when habitus was included in the model. We suggest that habitus may play a more central role than cultural capital in the reproduction of mathematics inequalities.

Our earlier work predicted this will lead to approximately 3620 avoidable deaths for four major tumour types (breast, bowel, lung, and oesophageal cancer) in the next 5 years. Here, using national population-based modelling, we estimate the health and economic losses resulting from these avoidable cancer deaths. We also compare these with the impact of an equivalent number of COVID-19 deaths to understand the welfare consequences of the different health conditions. METHODS: We estimate health losses using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lost economic productivity using the human capital (HC) approach. The analysis uses linked English National Health Service (NHS) cancer registration and hospital administrative datasets for patients aged 15-84 years, diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and oesophageal cancer between 1st Jan to 31st Dec 2010, with follow-up data until 31st Dec 2014, and diagnosed with lung cancer between 1st Jan to 31st Dec 31 2012, with follow-up data until 31st Dec 2015. Productivity losses are based on the estimation of excess additional deaths due to cancer at 1, 3 and 5 years for the four cancer types, which were derived from a previous analysis using this dataset. A total of 500 random samples drawn from the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported by the Office for National Statistics, stratified by gender, were used to estimate productivity losses for an equivalent number of deaths (n = 3620) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: We collected data for 32,583 patients with breast cancer, 24,975 with colorectal cancer, 6744 with oesophageal cancer, and 29,305 with lung cancer. We estimate that across the four site-specific cancers combined in England alone, additional excess cancer deaths would amount to a loss of 32,700 QALYs (95% CI 31,300-34,100) and productivity losses of 103.8million GBP (73.2-132.2) in the next five years. For breast cancer, we estimate a loss of 4100 QALYS (3900-4400) and productivity losses of 23.2 m (18.2-28.6); for colorectal cancer, 15,000 QALYS (14,100-16,000) lost and productivity losses of 35.7 m (22.4-48.7); for lung cancer 10,900 QALYS (9,900-11,700) lost and productivity losses of 38.3 m (14.0-59.9) for lung cancer; and for oesophageal cancer, 2700 QALYS (2300-3,100) lost and productivity losses of 6.6 m (-6 to -17.6). In comparison, the equivalent number of COVID-19 deaths caused approximately 21,450 QALYs lost, as well as productivity losses amounting to 76.4 m (73.5-79.2). CONCLUSION: Premature cancer deaths resulting from diagnostic delays during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK will result in significant economic losses. On a per-capita basis, this impact is, in fact, greater than that of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. These results emphasise the importance of robust evaluation of the trade-offs of the wider health, welfare and economic effects of NPI to support both resource allocation and the prioritisation of time-critical health services directly impacted in a pandemic, such as cancer care.","output":"Economic impact of avoidable cancer deaths caused by diagnostic delay during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national population-based modelling study in England, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vending machines are in great demand nowadays, especially in developed countries which are used as a tool for selling product to provide what people needs.

An augmented tourism demand function was developed and empirically estimated in line with classical theory for a panel of 16 countries from 2005M1 to 2017M12 through the AMG and CCEMG estimation techniques that address underlying heterogeneity, non\\\\stationarity, and cross\\\\sectional dependence. The study further examines the potential moderating effect of covid\\\\19 outbreak on the relationship between geopolitical risk and tourism by investigating the interactive effect of past outbreaks and geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Additional insight on causal relations between geopolitical risks and tourism demand was obtained using panel bootstrapping technique. The results show that geopolitical risk negatively impacts tourism demand, and that pandemic outbreaks aggravate the negative impact of geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Panel causality outcomes further confirm that geopolitical risk is a significant predictor of tourism demand (captured by either tourism receipts or number of inbound tourists). Our findings confirm that the dynamic attributes of both local and international political environments significantly impact the consumption decision of tourists and the economic performance of tourist destinations. Our recommendation is that pre\\\\crisis, in proposing policy directions for tourism sector development, policy\\\\makers should establish crisis management plans to protect the tourism sector. Post\\\\crisis, policy\\\\makers should initiate aggressive recovery marketing strategies to re\\\\establish the image of safety and attractiveness required to reassure potential tourists of the safety of the destination, thereby ensuring return to competitiveness and economic recovery.","output":"Geopolitical risk and tourism: Evidence from dynamic heterogeneous panel models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrospinning has been used to develop and upscale polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers as effective aerosol filtration materials for their potential use in respirators. The fibers were deposited onto non-woven spunbond polypropylene (SPP) and the basis weight (grammage, g/m(2)) was varied to assess the resulting effect on filtration efficiency and breathing resistance of the materials. The results indicated that a basis weight in excess of 0.4 g/m(2) of PAN electrospun fibers yielded a filtration efficiency over 97%, with breathing resistance values that increased proportionally with the amount of basis weight added. With the aim of retaining filter efficiency whilst lowering breathing resistance, the basis weight of 0.4 g/m(2) and 0.8 g/m(2) of PAN electrospun fibers were strategically split up and stacked with SPP in different configurations. The results suggested that a symmetric structure based on SPP/PAN/PAN/SPP was the optimal structure, as it reduces SPP consumption while maintaining an FFP2-type of filtration efficiency, while reducing breathing resistance, specially at high air flow rates, such as those mimicking FFP2 exhalation conditions. The incorporation of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles within the electrospun nanofibers in the form of nanocomposites, retained the high filtration characteristics of the unfilled filter, while exhibiting a strong bactericidal capacity, even after short contact times. This study demonstrates the potential of using the symmetric splitting of the PAN nanofibers layer as a somewhat more efficient configuration in the design of filters for respirators.","output":"Antimicrobial Nanofiber Based Filters for High Filtration Efficiency Respirators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers is variable throughout the world.

There was simultaneously a need to expand research to obtain crucial data about disease prognosis and therapy and enormous limitations on conducting research as localities and institutions limited travel and person-to-person contact. These imperatives resulted in major changes in the way research was conducted, including expediting Institutional Review Board review, shifting to remote interactions with participants, centralizing decision-making in prioritizing research protocols, establishing biobanks, adopting novel informatics platforms, and distributing study drugs in unconventional ways. National CTSA Steering Committee meetings provided an opportunity to share best practices and develop the idea of capturing the CTSA program experiences in a series of papers. Here we bring together the recommendations from those papers in a list of specific actions that research sites can take to strengthen operations and prepare for similar future public health emergencies. Most importantly, creative innovations developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic deserve serious consideration for adoption as new standards, thus converting the painful trauma of the pandemic into post-traumatic growth that makes the clinical research enterprise stronger, more resilient, and more effective.","output":"Re-engineering The Clinical Research Enterprise in Response to COVID-19: The Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) experience and proposed playbook for future pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Past research shows that physicians experience high ill-being (i.e., work-life conflict, stress, burnout) but also high well-being (i.e., job satisfaction, engagement). OBJECTIVE: To shed light on how medical facultys experiences of their job demands and job resources might differentially affect their ill-being and their well-being with special attention to the role that the work-life interface plays in these processes. METHODS: Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze interviews from 30 medical faculty (19 women, 11 men, average tenure 13.36 years) at a top research hospital in Canada. FINDINGS: Medical facultys experiences of work-life conflict were severe. Facultys job demands had coalescing (i.e., interactive) effects on their stress, work-life conflict, and exhaustion. Although supportive job resources (e.g., coworker support) helped to mitigate the negative effects of job demands, stimulating job resources (e.g., challenging work) contributed to greater work-life conflict, stress, and exhaustion. Thus, for these medical faculty job resources play a dual-role for work-life conflict. Moreover, although faculty experienced high emotional exhaustion, they did not experience the other components of burnout (i.e., reduced self-efficacy, and depersonalization). Some faculty engaged in cognitive reappraisal strategies to mitigate their experiences of work-life conflict and its harmful consequences. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the precise nature and effects of job demands and job resources may be more complex than current research suggests. Hospital leadership should work to lessen unnecessary job demands, increase supportive job resources, recognize all aspects of job performance, and, given facultys high levels of work engagement, encourage a climate that fosters work-life balance.","output":"INSPIRED but Tired: How Medical Facultys Job Demands and Resources Lead to Engagement, Work-Life Conflict, and Burnout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The discovery that medical treatment could be successful in cases with uncomplicated acute appendicitis (UCAA) has revealed the need for successfully differentiating cases with complicated acute appendicitis (CAA). The present study exam-ined the usability of neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR), immature granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, and red blood cell distribution width-to-lymphocyte ratio (RDWLR) in the CAA/UCAA differentiation. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was made of patients undergoing appendectomy between January 2019 and December 2020. According to pathological and clinical findings, the patients were divided into negative appendectomy, CAA and UCAA groups. Labo-ratory parameters and associated ratios were evaluated by comparing the groups. RESULTS: The study included 348 patients. Of the patients, 11.2% had CAA, 81.6% had UCAA, and 7.2% had negative appendec-tomy.

The immune system plays a crucial role in the severity of COVID-19 and the development of pneumonia-induced acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Along with providing protection, both innate and T cell-based adaptive immune response dysregulate during severe SARS-CoV2 infection. This dysregulation is more pronounced in older population and patients with comorbidities (Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, other pulmonary and autoimmune diseases). However, COVID-19 patients develop protective antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV2, but they do not long for last. The induction of the immune response against the pathogen also requires metabolic energy that generates through the process of immunometabolism. The change in the metabolic stage of immune cells from homeostasis to an inflammatory or infectious environment is called immunometabolic reprogramming.

Indeed, the biological plausibility of infectobesity includes direct roles of some viruses to reprogram host metabolism toward a more lipogenic and adipogenic status. Furthermore, the probability that humans may exchange microbiota components (virome/virobiota) points out that the altered response of IFN and other cytokines, which surfaces as a central mechanism for adipogenesis and obesity-associated immune suppression, is due to the fact that gut microbiota uphold intrinsic IFN signaling. Last but not least, the adaptation of both host immune and metabolic system under persistent viral infections play a central role in these phenomena. We hereby discuss the possible link between adenovirus and obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mechanisms of adenovirus-36 (Ad-36) involvement in hepatic steatosis/NAFLD consist in reducing leptin gene expression and insulin sensitivity, augmenting glucose uptake, activating the lipogenic and pro-inflammatory pathways in adipose tissue, and increasing the level of macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, all of these ultimately leading to chronic inflammation and altered lipid metabolism. Moreover, by reducing leptin expression and secretion Ad-36 may have in turn an obesogenic effect through increased food intake or decreased energy expenditure via altered fat metabolism. Finally, Ad-36 is involved in upregulation of cAMP, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and p38 signaling pathways, downregulation of Wnt10b expression, increased expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 with consequential lipid accumulation.","output":"Findings from Studies Are Congruent with Obesity Having a Viral Origin, but What about Obesity-Related NAFLD?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we describe a case of a 61-year-old male patient with acute type A aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta, and the abdominal aorta down to the iliac bifurcation with evidence of left common iliac artery occlusion.

The main binding site of pirfenidone in DPPC liposomes is the carbonyl group: the interaction with PF significantly increases the proportion of low-hydrated carbonyl groups as revealed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The phosphate group acts as an additional binding site;however, due to shielding by the choline group, this interaction is weak. The hydrophobic part of the bilayer is not involved in PF binding at room temperature. Cholesterol changes the way of interaction between carbonyl groups and pirfenidone probably because of the formation of two subpopulations of DPPC and causes a dramatic redistribution of carbonyl groups onto the degrees of hydration. The proportion of moderately hydrated carbonyl groups increases, apparently due to the deepening of pirfenidone into the circumpolar region of the bilayer.

Qualitative evidence synthesis was used. Four electronic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE. MEDLINE, PsycINFO) were searched. Primary qualitative studies were included if they investigated the experiences of primary healthcare professionals using a biopsychosocial model of musculoskeletal pain care in outpatient settings, or their perceptions towards biopsychosocial-oriented clinical practice guidelines. After screening 6571 abstracts, 77 full text articles were retrieved. Twenty-five studies met the eligibility criteria, reporting the experiences of 413 healthcare professionals (including general practitioners, physiotherapists and others) spanning 11 countries. Three metathemes were identified that impact the adoption of the biopsychosocial model across the whole-of-health: (1) at the micro-level, healthcare professionals' personal factors, knowledge and skills, and their misconceptions of clinical practice guidelines, perception of patients' factors and time; (2) at the meso-level, clinical practice guideline formulation, community factors, funding models, health service provision, resourcing issues and workforce training issues; and (3) at the macro-level, health policy, organizational and social factors. Synthesized data revealed multi-level (whole-of-health) barriers and enablers to health professionals adopting a biopsychosocial model of pain into practice. Awareness of these multi-level factors may help inform pre-implementation preparedness and support more effective implementation of the biopsychosocial model of musculoskeletal pain into clinical practice.","output":"Barriers and enablers influencing healthcare professionals' adoption of a biopsychosocial approach to musculoskeletal pain: A systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to present a summary of the clinicopathological characteristics of patients affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used as a reference for further research and clinical decisions. DESIGN: Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they had cohort, case-control or case series designs and provided sufficient details on clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and asymptomatic patients. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were electronically searched to identify related studies published between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the studies in the meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: The confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 55 unique retrospective studies involving 8697 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%). About 5.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts (64.7%) and elevated C reactive protein levels (65.9%). Lymphopaenia was observed in about 47.6% of the infected patients, along with abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes (49.4%) and liver function (26.4%). Other findings included leucopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leucocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%) and abnormal renal function (10.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopaenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease.","output":"Clinicopathological characteristics of 8697 patients with COVID-19 in China: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess and quantify the impact COVID-19 has had thus far on ischemic stroke admission rate and severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score) at a single tertiary center in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.

Little is known about the effects of prolonged hypothermia or rewarming on autoregulation after cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that rewarming would shift the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA), that this shift would be detected by indices derived from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and that rewarming would impair autoregulation during hypertension. Anesthetized neonatal swine underwent sham surgery or hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest, followed by 2 h of normothermia and 20 h of hypothermia, with or without rewarming. Piglets were further divided into cohorts for cortical laser-Doppler flow (LDF) measurements during induced hypotension or hypertension. We also tested whether indices derived from NIRS could identify the LDF-derived LLA. The LLA did not differ significantly among groups with sham surgery and hypothermia (29  8 mmHg), sham surgery and rewarming (34  7 mmHg), arrest and hypothermia (29  10 mmHg), and arrest and rewarming (38  11 mmHg). The LLA was not affected by arrest (P = 0.60), temperature (P = 0.08), or interaction between arrest and temperature (P = 0.73). The NIRS-derived indices detected the LLA accurately, with the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves of 0.81-0.96 among groups. In groups subjected to arrest and hypothermia, with or without rewarming, the slope of LDF relative to cerebral perfusion pressure during hypertension was not significantly different from zero (P > 0.10). In conclusion, rewarming did not shift the LLA during hypotension or affect autoregulation during hypertension after asphyxic cardiac arrest.

Despite all efforts to contain the spread of the disease, the number of infections and deaths continue to rise, particularly in some regions. Given its presence in the salivary secretions of affected patients, and the presence of many reported asymptomatic cases that have tested positive for COVID-19, dental professionals, including Endodontists, are at high risk of becoming infected if they do not take appropriate precautions. As of today, there are no predictable treatments or approved vaccines that can protect the public and healthcare professionals from the virus; however, there is speculation that a vaccine might be available sometime in 2021. Until then, general dentists and Endodontist will need to be able to treat emergency patients in order to relieve pressure on emergency clinics in hospitals or local community hubs. In addition, as the pandemic continues, strategies to manage patients will need to evolve from a palliative to a more permanent/definitive treatment approach. In this article, an update on the treatment considerations for dental care in general is provided, as well as a discussion on the available endodontic guidelines reported in the literature.

It is an enveloped virus with positivesense singlestranded RNA. Patients with COVID-19 are usually present with symptoms of fever, dry cough, myalgia, dysgeusia, nausea, diarrhoea, hyposmia and later it progresses into pneumonia. Dentists are at potential risk because they are in consistent exposure of blood and saliva, so they should have knowledge of COVID-19 infection, transmission & prevention for proper infection control practices. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to assess the knowledge and perception of DHPs toward COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among practicing dental professionals in Lucknow city (U.P) India. A total of 302 Dental Health Practitioners (DHPs) participated in the study. Knowledge was assessed using self-administered, structured questionnaire. The questions were administered online through Google Forms by sending link to the registered Dentist through E-mail. RESULTS: A total of 350 DHPs were participated in the study, among which 302 DHPs has given complete responses and was included in the analysis. Simple linear regression showed a significant relationship between knowledge with age of dentist (p < 0.001), qualification as MDS (p = 0.025), practice as private (p < 0.001), experience between 5 and 10 years (p = 0.009), and experienced more than 10 years(p = 0.006).

During this period, the activities of children and caregivers were not strongly restricted by the public system. Caregivers' anxiety about children's activities was positively associated with caregivers' and children's fears of COVID-19 and children's depressive symptoms. Children's preventive behavior was negatively associated with children's depressive symptoms. These findings suggested that caregivers' fear of COVID-19 stemmed from worry about the relationship between children's activity and COVID-19 infection, and children might have reflected caregivers' expressions of concern. In schools and clinics, practitioners educate children on how to engage in preventive behavior against COVID-19.

Individuals who walk at least 10 000 steps per day are likely to meet recommended physical activity guidelines. Very little is known about the physical activity levels of doctors at work, in particular those working in emergency departments (EDs). OBJECTIVES To determine how many steps per shift were taken by doctors in a South African (SA) ED. Secondary objectives were to assess what factors influenced the number of steps taken. METHODS This was a prospective observational cohort study in a tertiary academic teaching hospital ED in Johannesburg over a 1-month period. Doctors wore pedometers during their day shifts in the ED and the number of steps taken during their shifts was measured, as well as the number and triage category of patients seen and whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed. RESULTS The median (interquartile range) number of steps taken per shift was 6 328 (4 646 - 8 409). The number of steps taken exceeded the 10 000-step target in only 11.7% of shifts. The overall mean (standard deviation (SD)) number of steps per hour was 744 (490). Factors that significantly increased the number of steps taken included shift duration, number of patients seen who were triaged yellow, and performance of CPR in a shift. Each additional hour of shift led to a mean (SD) increase of 575 (115) steps. Each additional yellow patient seen led to a mean (SD) increase of 118 (108) steps. The mean (SD) number of steps for a shift with CPR was significantly higher (8 309 (850) steps) than for a shift without CPR (6 496 (384) steps). CONCLUSIONS Doctors working in an SA ED are not achieving the daily recommended number of steps while at work.

METHODS Tracheal stenosis was induced by inserting a segmented endotracheal tube of 1.5cm length which was wrapped with a commercialized absorbable hemostat in 15 New Zealand white rabbits, while sham surgery controls (n=3) underwent tracheotomy and direct closure of tracheal exposure. The tube was removed transorally, 1 week after tube insertion. All rabbits were evaluated endoscopically at 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks after the tube insertion. The rabbits were sacrificed 3 weeks after the surgery, and the excised tissue of trachea was processed along with the procedure of standard hematoxylin eosin staining and observed under a microscope. RESULTS Tracheal stenosis was induced in all rabbits (range 32-84% stenosis) with no death of rabbits during the study. The histological features of tracheal stenosis demonstrated thickening and fibrosis of lamina propria and submucosa with relatively intact cartilage framework. CONCLUSIONS We developed a rabbit model of tracheal stenosis induced by endotracheal intubation using a segmented tracheal tube. Since the model is based on the physiologic condition of prolonged endotracheal intubation, it may be used in variable studies related to tracheal stenosis.","output":"Rabbit model of tracheal stenosis induced by prolonged endotracheal intubation using a segmented tube."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first recorded case of COVID-19 on February 26, 2020, Brazil has seen an exponential growth in the number of cases and deaths. The national testing approach has been insufficient to correctly use this tool in the support of containing the epidemic in the country. In this communication, we discuss efforts and challenges to scale-up COVID-19 testing at the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). This communication presents the initial results of the research project created to investigate the political, industrial, technological, and regulatory aspects that may affect the diagnostic and testing capacity for COVID-19 in Brazil. The paper draws on the review of academic literature, media publication, and collection of public data on tests purchase and regulation. It enlists initiatives to enhance PCR testing, national production and development of technologies, as well as regulatory measures to fast-track new tests. Our analysis indicates some points of reflection. Firstly, the lack of a consistent national strategy to fight COVID-19 exarcebated supply problems of diagnostic components. If the country was eventually able to circumvent this situation, it still faces a more structural dependency on the importation of diagnostic components. Secondly, the discontinued funding and distribution of tests may have implied health policy fragmentation and the growing importance of local governments and non-state actors to fighting the epidemics within SUS. Finally, initiatives established since the second semester of 2020 have expanded the testing capacity at SUS. However, it has not been sufficient to control the progress of the epidemic in the country.","output":"Testing COVID-19 in Brazil: fragmented efforts and challenges to expand diagnostic capacity at the Brazilian Unified National Health System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection in two meta-analyses Mendelian randomization shows a causal effect of low vitamin D on bacterial pneumonias risk These studies involved patients before COVID-19 pandemic Several association studies found higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, greater COVID-19 severity and higher risk of mortality in vitamin D deficient subjects compared to vitamin D non-deficient controls We draw attention to the trend of inverse relative COVID-19 mortality in Europe versus the states of the Southern Hemisphere (Australia, Brazil, South Africa) in dependence on season, which may be associated with intensity of ultraviolet radiation and consequent seasonal fluctuation of serum vitamin D levels Although we cannot yet confirm causal role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 positivity or COVID-19, we recommend consumption of vitamin D rich food or vitamin D sup-plementation in the non-sunny season to prevent vitamin D deficiency ? 2020, Czech Medical Association J E Purkyne All rights reserved","output":"Season of the year, vitamin D and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have excellent systemic activity and are standard first line treatment in EGFR/ALK wild type metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their role in patients with brain metastases, which affects over 20% of patients and cause significant morbidity, is less clear. METHODS We reviewed patients with EGFR/ALK wild-type mNSCLC with CNS metastases. Serial MRIs were reviewed to determine the time to intracranial progression (iPFS). Multivariate regression was performed to adjust for the disease-specific graded prognostic score (ds-GPA). RESULTS We identified 36 ICI- and 33 chemotherapy-treated patients with baseline CNS metastases and available serial MRIs (average frequency:3.5 months). Baseline radiation was given except for 2 chemotherapy-treated patients with asymptomatic solitary metastasis. The CNS burden of disease was higher in the ICI-treated group (ICI:22% vs. chemotherapy:0% had >10 lesions; p = 0.02), but the utilization of WBRT was not (ICI:31% vs. chemotherapy:45%; p = 0.09). At the time of progression, CNS involvement was identified in 30 % of ICI-treated patients compared to 64 % of chemotherapy controls (p = 0.02). ICI-treated patients had superior iPFS (13.5 vs 8.4 months) that remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR 1.9; 95%CI 1.1--3.4). Superior CNS outcomes in ICI-treated patients were driven by the PD-L1 high subgroup where the 12-month cumulative incidence rate of CNS progression was 19% in ICI-treated PD-L1  50%, 50% in ICI-treated PD-L1 < 50% and 58% in chemotherapy-treated patients (p = 0.03).

The addition of steroids is more effective than local anesthetic alone in TFEBs for patients with LDH. Moreover, the efficacy of TFEBs has been reported to be positively correlated with the volume of injectate. We hypothesized that high-volume TFEBs without steroids effectively alleviate axial back and radicular pain associated with LDH. This study compared the efficacy of high-volume TFEBs with vs. without steroids for the management of the axial and radicular pain caused by LDH. METHODS: A total of 54 patients were randomly assigned to either group L or group D. Patients in group L received 8-mL injections of 0.33% lidocaine only. Patients in group D received 8-mL injections of 0.33% lidocaine with 5 mg of dexamethasone. The primary outcomes were pain intensity at baseline and 4 weeks after the procedure. The secondary outcomes included the change of functional disability between baseline and 4 weeks after the procedure, pain scores during injection, and adverse effects. RESULTS: Both groups showed a significant reduction in axial and radicular pain and improvement in the functional status at the outpatient visit 4 weeks after TFEB. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of changes in back pain (10.00 [20.00] vs. 10.00 [22.50]; P = 0.896) or radicular pain (5.00 [20.00] vs. 10.00 [12.50]; P = 0.871).

Nevertheless, the prevalence of burnout syndrome among this critical population remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence rate of burnout and its associated factors in a sample of resident physicians in Sudan. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used to assess the burnout syndrome among resident physicians at the teaching hospitals of Wad-Medani in Gezira state, east-central Sudan. Three hundred resident physicians at the dermatology, general surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, ear, nose and throat (ENT), oncology, urology, and internal medicine departments, were approached and invited to participate in the study. The Arabic version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory was distributed to respondents from July to October 2021. RESULTS: From the 300 resident physicians, 208 (69.3%) responded. The average age of the study population was 29.99  3.01 years, with more than half were females (56.7%), single (59.6%), and with more than three years of residency experience (50.5%). In total, 86.1% met the criteria for burnout in at least one dimension and 13.9% in all three dimensions. On the dimension of emotional exhaustion (EE), 70.7% reported high levels of burnout. While, 44.2% reported high levels of depersonalization (DP), and 73.1% experienced a sense of decreased professional accomplishment (PA). There were significant differences in burnout, EE, and DP levels among different specialties, with the pediatrics-specialty trainees reported higher levels. Burnout syndrome was associated with the working hours per single duty; participants who reported working for more than 24 hours had experienced higher levels of burnout, EE, and DP.

However, these techniques remain significantly underutilized. A grant-funded, collaborative, regional quality improvement project was designed to support the implementation of precision RT techniques through inter-professional learning. The objective of this report is to describe the program design and early deliverables. Materials and Methods: A team from the AC Cancer Centres and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre was convened. A needs survey of AC RT centres conducted in 2019 and updated in 2020 guided program development. Adapting to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, a virtual CME program delivered in four phases over four months was planned. The program includes expertled presentations and discussions, sharing of knowledge and protocols, and the development of centre-specific teams, goals, and implementation plans. A coordinated formative evaluation, using a realist evaluation approach, was designed to monitor implementation and address centre-specific and region-wide challenges to achieve accelerated implementation of precision RT techniques. Quantitative and qualitative methods will utilize the following data to be collected: use of the implementation strategies;timelines and local adoption of stereotactic RT techniques;specialists' knowledge and comfort level;specialists' satisfaction and experiences with the education received;and specialists' and decision-makers' perspectives on implementation processes, barriers, and facilitators. Results: Phase I and II consisted of two half-day virtual meetings. One hundred twenty-six participants including radiation therapists (40), radiation oncologists (27), medical physicists (19), planners (15), trainees (10), administrators (six), nurses (four), and others (five) from all six AC RT centres. Centres with developed protocols for stereotactic RT techniques provided expert content. Virtual break-out rooms grouped centre-specific inter-disciplinary teams who determined customized goals and commenced the development of implementation plans with leadership approval. Follow-up meetings will be conducted at two and four months. Grant funding was used to support meeting organization, RTT participation, online communication platforms, and a project coordinator. The evaluation is ongoing. Conclusions: With a collaborative expert-guided approach, evidence-based advancements in RT delivery can be accomplished in an accelerated manner on an AC regional basis despite variations in centre size and mandates. Evaluation of this process will inform on enablers to accelerate technology and improvements in the care of patients undergoing RT.","output":"Advancing Radiation Oncology Practice in Atlantic Canada (aropac)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Central nervous system (CNS) diseases are responsible for a large proportion of morbidity and mortality worldwide. CNS diseases caused by intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli stimulate the resident immune cells including microglia and astrocyte, resulting in neuroinflammation that exacerbates the progression of diseases. Recent evidence reveals the aberrant expression patterns of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the damaged tissues following CNS diseases. It was also proposed that lncRNAs possessed immune-modulatory activities by directly or indirectly affecting various effector proteins including transcriptional factor, acetylase, protein kinase, phosphatase, etc. In addition, lncRNAs can form a sophisticated network by interacting with other molecules to regulate the expression or activation of downstream immune response pathways. However, the major roles of lncRNAs in CNS pathophysiologies are still elusive, especially in neuroinflammation. Herein, we tend to review some potential roles of lncRNAs in modulating neuroinflammation based on current evidence in various CNS diseases, in order to provide novel explanations for the initiation and progression of CNS diseases and help to establish therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammation.","output":"Long non-coding RNA: an underlying bridge linking neuroinflammation and central nervous system diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantitatively describing the time course of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within an infected individual is important for understanding the current global pandemic and possible ways to combat it.

Here, we searched for drivers of VOC-like emergence by consolidating sequencing results from a set of twenty-seven chronic infections. Most substitutions in this set reflected lineage-defining VOC mutations, yet a subset of mutations associated with successful global transmission was absent from chronic infections. The emergence of these mutations might dictate when variants from chronic infections can dramatically spread onwards. Next, we tested the ability to predict antibody-evasion mutations from patient- and viral-specific features, and found that viral rebound is strongly associated with the emergence of antibody-evasion. We found evidence for dynamic polymorphic viral populations in most patients, suggesting that a compromised immune system selects for antibody-evasion in particular niches in a patient's body. We suggest that a trade-off exists between antibody-evasion and transmissibility that potentially constrains VOC emergence, and that monitoring chronic infections may be a means to predict future VOCs.","output":"Drivers of adaptive evolution during chronic SARS-CoV-2 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 40-year-old woman developed a fever, sore throat, and cough.

COVID-19 represents a fatal disease with a great global public health importance. This study aims to develop a three-parameter Weibull mathematical model using continuous functions to represent discrete COVID-19 data. Subsequently, the model was applied to quantitatively analyze the characteristics for the mortality of COVID-19, including the age, sex, the length of symptom time to hospitalization time (SH), hospitalization date to death time (HD) and symptom time to death time time (SD) and others. A three-parameter mathematical model was developed by combining the reported cases in the Data Repository from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and applied to estimate and analyze the characteristics for mortality of COVID-19. We found that the scale parameters of males and females were 5.85 and 5.45, respectively. Probability density functions in both males and females were negative skewness. 5% of male patients died under the age of 43.28 (44.37 for females), 50% died under 69.55 (73.25 for females), and 95% died under 86.59 (92.78 for females). The peak age of male death was 67.45 years, while that of female death was 71.10 years. The peak and median values of SH, HD and SD in male death were correspondingly 1.17, 5.18 and 10.30 days, and 4.29, 11.36 and 16.33 days, while those in female death were 1.19, 5.80 and 12.08 days, and 4.60, 12.44 and 17.67 days, respectively. The peak age of probability density in male and female deaths was 69.55 and 73.25 years, while the high point age of their mortality risk was 77.51 and 81.73 years, respectively. The mathematical model can fit and simulate the impact of various factors on IFR. From the simulation results of the model, we can intuitively find the IFR, peak age, average age and other information of each age. In terms of time factors, the mortality rate of the most susceptible population is not the highest, and the distribution of male patients is different from the distribution of females. This means that Self-protection and self-recovery in females against SARS-CoV-2 virus might be better than those of males. Males were more likely to be infected, more likely to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die of COVID-19. Moreover, the infection fatality ration (IFR) of COVID-19 population was intrinsically linked to the infection age.

A cross-sectional study was performed of 310 respondents about different COVID-19 related influencing factors in Pakistan. The partial least square-structural equation modeling was applied to estimate the path coefficient. Moral and subject norms (0.359) had a comparatively higher path coefficient. Other influencing factors/drivers were preventive e-guideline by the government (0.215) followed by COVID-19 knowledge (0.197), and behavioral control (0.121). The intention to prevent COVID-19 showed a positive and significant impact (0.705) on risk aversion. The indirect analysis also confirmed that the positive influence of moral and subject norms, COVID-19 knowledge, preventive e-guideline by the government, and behavioral control on risk aversion. However, the path coefficient of environmental factors was negative but insignificant, which implies than environmental factors do not influence the intention to prevent COVID-19. It is suggested to provide clear guidelines using print, social, electronic media. It is also suggested to provide e-guidelines in local languages. The COVID-19 knowledge about its transmission, symptoms, and precautions is also useful. It is suggested to include the causes, symptoms, and precaution of viral diseases in the educational syllabus.

Released from the post-pituitary gland, vasopressin induces vasoconstriction through the activation of V1a receptors located on vascular smooth muscle cells. Due to its non-selective receptor affinity arginineCvasopressin also activates V2 (located on renal tubular cells of collecting ducts) and V1b (located in the anterior pituitary and in the pancreas) receptors, thereby potentially promoting undesired side effects such as anti-diuresis, procoagulant properties due to release of the von Willebrands factor and platelet activation. Finally, it also cross-activates oxytocin receptors. During septic shock, vasopressin plasma levels were reported to be lower than expected, and a hypersensitivity to its vasopressor effect is reported in such situation. Terlipressin and selepressin are synthetic vasopressin analogues with a higher affinity for the V1 receptor, and, hence, potentially less side effects. In this narrative review, we present the current knowledge of the rationale, benefits and risks of vasopressin use in the setting of septic shock and vasoplegic shock following cardiac surgery. Clearly, vasopressin administration allows reducing norepinephrine requirements, but so far, no improvement of survival was reported and side effects are frequent, particularly ischaemic events. Finally, we will discuss the current indications for vasopressin and its agonists in the setting of septic shock, and the remaining unresolved questions.","output":"Vasopressin and its analogues in shock states: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AJOL Abstract: Background: The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, as a highlycontagious infection transmitted via droplets, and person-to-person contact. Airborne and aerosol transmission have also been implicated. Aerosol generating procedures such as scaling and polishing may increase the risk for developing COVID-19 in dental clinics, and may thus place some psychological strain on dental therapists. This study aimed to determine the psychosocial effect of COVID?19 on dental therapists in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out following ethical approval from the institutional Ethics Committee. Data collection was through self-administered online questionnaires and included socio-demographic characteristics. Psychosocial well?being was assessed using a five?point Likert scale that assessed the level of worry. Scores were summed up to obtain the mean (range 5-25). Statistical significance was set at a level of P  0.05. Results: The 192 respondents had a mean age of 28.0  7.2 years, 96.9% were aware of COVID?19. Sixteen (8.3%) participants reported at least one medical condition. The mean psychosocial?wellbeing score was 18.4  4.9.

As a result, individuals lost their social relationships, leading to social isolation and loneliness. Both social isolation and loneliness are major risk factors for poor physical and mental health status through enhanced chronic inflammation; however, there might be an interplay between social isolation and loneliness on the association with chronic inflammation. We aimed to clarify the link between social relationships and inflammation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by distinguishing whether social isolation only, loneliness only, or both were associated with chronic inflammation markers among community-dwelling adults. The data of 624 people (aged 18-92 years, mean 51.4) from the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) study, which targeted randomly sampled households in Utsunomiya city, Japan, were analyzed. Social isolation was assessed as a structural social network by asking the number of social roles they have on a daily basis. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA loneliness scale. As chronic inflammation biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Generalized estimating equations method was employed to take into account the correlations within households. Isolated-Lonely condition (i.e., being both socially isolated and feeling lonely) was associated with higher NLR among men (B = 0.141, 95%CI = -0.01 to 0.29). Interestingly, Nonisolated-Lonely condition (i.e., not socially isolated but feeling lonely) was associated with lower CRP among women (B = -0.462, 95%CI = -0.82 to -0.10) and among the working-age population (B = -0.495, 95%CI = -0.76 to -0.23). In conclusion, being both socially isolated and feeling lonely was associated with chronic inflammation. Assessing both social isolation and loneliness is critical for proper interventions to mitigate the impact of poor social relationships on health, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Interplay between social isolation and loneliness and chronic systemic inflammation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: Results from U-CORONA study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exercise pressor reflex arises from contracting muscle and is manifested by increases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility. In patients with peripheral artery disease, the exercise pressor reflex is exaggerated. This effect is believed to be caused by a metabolite whose concentration is increased when the working muscles are inadequately perfused. Previous work in rats with simulated peripheral artery disease has shown that pharmacological blockade of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3), which is found on group III and IV afferents, prevented the exaggeration of the exercise pressor reflex. Blockade of ASIC3, however, may have off-target effects that preclude a conclusion that ASIC3 plays a role in evoking the reflex in rats with simulated peripheral artery disease. In the present experiments performed in decerebrated rats with simulated peripheral artery disease, we compared the exercise pressor reflex in rats with a functional knockout of the ASIC3 (KO) with the reflex in their wild-type counterparts (WT). We found that the exercise pressor reflex in ASIC3 KO rats was significantly lower than the exercise pressor reflex in their WT counterparts (P < 0.05). ASIC 3 KO rats demonstrated lower pressor responses to intra\\\\arterial injection of diprotonated phosphate (86 mM; pH 6.0), lactic acid (12 mM; pH 2.85), and capsaicin (0.2 g; pH 7.2) (P < 0.05). In contrast, both ligated WT and ASIC3 KO rats displayed similar pressor responses to tendon stretch (P > 0.05). We conclude that ASIC3 play an important role in evoking the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in rats with peripheral artery disease. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used a genetic approach to test the hypothesis that the magnitude of the exercise pressor reflex evoked in ligated ASIC3 KO rats was significantly lower than the magnitude of the exercise pressor reflex evoked in their ligated wild-type (WT) counterparts.

This wide-ranging original approach now permits an increase in our understanding of these opposite processes, cancer and neurodegeneration, and, as a consequence, allows us to propose new avenues of treatment based upon the intracellular and microenvironmental hydrogen ion dynamics regulating and deregulating the biochemistry and metabolism of both cancer and neural cells. Under the same perspective, the etiopathogenesis and special characteristics of multiple sclerosis (MS) is an excellent model for the study of neurodegenerative diseases and, utilizing this pioneering approach, we find that MS appears to be a metabolic disease even before an autoimmune one.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the perception of young Italians and to assess their knowledge and attitudes about the disease. METHODS: An online survey was conducted on 3rd-4th-5th February 2020 with the collaboration of Skuola.net, an important Italian Website for students. Young people had the opportunity to participate in the survey by answering an ad hoc questionnaire created to investigate knowledge and attitudes about the new Coronavirus, using a link published on the homepage. RESULTS: 5234 responses were received of which 3262 were females and 1972 were males, aged from 11 to 30. 82,4% were students (50,4% high school students) while 17,6% did not attend school or university. Regarding knowledge, 80% of the participants knew that the infection occurs through droplets from infected people; 63% knew that symptoms can appear up to 14 days after exposure; 80% knew that a vaccine has not yet been discovered. Regarding attitudes, 36% admitted that their attitude towards Chinese tourists has significantly worsened; 26% did not buy from Chinese run stores and 24% avoided Chinese restaurants. CONCLUSIONS: Although most of the participants seem correctly informed about COVID-19, young Italians are at risk of assuming irrational behavior due to psychosis.

However, abrogating the inflammatory response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and pre-dispose to secondary infections. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of critically ill COVID-19 patients during an 8-week span and compared the prevalence of secondary infection and outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. Results: One hundred eleven patients were identified, of which 54 had received tocilizumab while 57 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (48.1 vs. 28.1%; p = 0.029 and fungal (5.6 vs. 0%; p = 0.112) infections. Consistent with higher number of infections, patients who received tocilizumab had higher mortality (35.2 vs. 19.3%; p = 0.020). Seven cases underwent autopsy. In three cases who received tocilizumab, there was evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the four cases that had not been given tocilizumab, two showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and two exhibited diffuse alveolar damage. Conclusions: Experimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials.

Although the global epidemic situation is stabilizing due to vaccination, new COVID-19 cases are constantly being discovered around the world. As a result, lung computed tomography (CT) examination, an aggregated identification technique, has been used to ameliorate diagnosis. It helps reveal missed diagnoses due to the ambiguity of nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, this study investigated how quickly and accurately hybrid deep learning (DL) methods can identify infected individuals with COVID-19 on the basis of their lung CT images. In addition, this study proposed a developed system to create a reliable COVID-19 prediction network using various layers starting with the segmentation of the lung CT scan image and ending with disease prediction. The initial step of the system starts with a proposed technique for lung segmentation that relies on a no-threshold histogram-based image segmentation method. Afterward, the GrabCut method was used as a post-segmentation method to enhance segmentation outcomes and avoid over-and under-segmentation problems. Then, three pre-trained models of standard DL methods, including Visual Geometry Group Network, convolutional deep belief network, and high-resolution network, were utilized to extract the most affective features from the segmented images that can help to identify COVID-19. These three described pre-trained models were combined as a new mechanism to increase the system's overall prediction capabilities. A publicly available dataset, namely, COVID-19 CT, was used to test the performance of the proposed model, which obtained a 95% accuracy rate. On the basis of comparison, the proposed model outperformed several state-of-the-art studies.

More had sufficient gloves (63.4%) compared to all other PPE types (p < .001 for all). Face shields and N95 respirators were the least available (13.6% and 18.2% had sufficient supplies, respectively; p < .001 for all). Many (66.9%) had sufficient hand soap, but far fewer had sufficient hand sanitizer (29.5%, X(2)=211.1, p < .001). Less than half (45.4%, n=545) had sufficient disinfection supplies. CONCLUSIONS: Many US healthcare facilities had very low amounts of PPE, hand hygiene products, and disinfection supplies early on during the pandemic. A lack of these supplies can lead to occupational exposures and illness as well as healthcare-associated transmission of COVID-19 and other diseases.","output":"Availability of Personal Protective Equipment and Infection Prevention Supplies During the First Month of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Study by the APIC COVID-19 Task Force"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 emergency, the medical operating protocols have been largely modified for reducing any type of contamination risk, for working in a safe way and for making the patient feel in a safe environment.

Currently, only few antiviral agents are available for the treatment of MERS, but their effects have been greatly impaired by low antiviral activity, poor metabolic stability, and serious adverse effects. Therefore, the development of effective treatment for MERS is urgently needed. In this study, a series of heptad repeat 1 (HR1) peptide inhibitors have been developed to inhibit HR1/HR2-mediated membrane fusion between MERS-CoV and host cells, which is the major pathway of MERS-CoV-induced host infections. Particularly, peptide pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) exhibits potent inhibitory activity with IC50 of 1.171 M, and its inhibitory effects can be further increased to 10-fold by forming a gold nanorod complex (PIH-AuNRs). In addition, PIH-AuNRs display enhanced metabolic stability and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, effectively prevent MERS-CoV-associated membrane fusion. In summary, PIH-AuNRs represent a novel class of antiviral agents and have a great potential in treating MERS in the clinic.","output":"Novel Gold Nanorod-Based HR1 Peptide Inhibitor for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passing through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to treat neurological conditions is one of the main hurdles in modern medicine. Many drugs with promising in vitro profiles become ineffective in vivo due to BBB restrictive permeability. In particular, this includes drugs such as antiviral porphyrins, with the ability to fight brain-resident viruses causing diseases such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In the last two decades, BBB shuttles, particularly peptide-based ones, have shown promise in carrying various payloads across the BBB. Thus, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) formed by covalent attachment of a BBB peptide shuttle and an antiviral drug may become key therapeutic tools in treating neurological disorders of viral origin. In this study, we have used various approaches (guanidinium, phosphonium, and carbodiimide-based couplings) for on-resin synthesis of new peptide-porphyrin conjugates (PPCs) with BBB-crossing and potential antiviral activity. After careful fine-tuning of the synthetic chemistry, DIC/oxyma has emerged as a preferred method, by which 14 different PPCs have been made and satisfactorily characterized. The PPCs are prepared by coupling a porphyrin carboxyl group to an amino group (either N-terminal or a Lys side chain) of the peptide shuttle and show effective in vitro BBB translocation ability, low cytotoxicity toward mouse brain endothelial cells, and low hemolytic activity. Three of the PPCs, MP-P5, P4-MP, and P4-L-MP, effectively inhibiting HIV infectivity in vitro, stand out as most promising. Their efficacy against other brain-targeting viruses (Dengue, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2) is currently under evaluation, with preliminary results confirming that PPCs are a promising strategy to treat viral brain infections.","output":"Penetrating the Blood-Brain Barrier with New Peptide-Porphyrin Conjugates Having anti-HIV Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is forcing medical doctors to deal with the urgent need to find clinical answers in an area where, unfortunately, there are still therapies with no evidence of efficacy and safety In any case, they must make decisions and face the dilemma of immediately using any therapeutic options that has some plausibility of treatment or instead making clinical trial However, the latter require formal steps and procedures How do medical doctors understand which of these are essential and necessary?

SETTING: Schools (including early years settings, primary schools and secondary schools). INTERVENTION: School closures and reopenings. OUTCOME MEASURE: Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (including any measure of community infections rate, hospital admissions or mortality attributed to COVID-19). METHODS: On 7 January 2021, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research Database, ERIC, the British Education Index, the Australian Education Index and Google, searching title and abstracts for terms related to SARS-CoV-2 AND terms related to schools or non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool to evaluate bias. RESULTS: We identified 7474 articles, of which 40 were included, with data from 150 countries. Of these, 32 studies assessed school closures and 11 examined reopenings. There was substantial heterogeneity between school closure studies, with half of the studies at lower risk of bias reporting reduced community transmission by up to 60% and half reporting null findings. The majority (n=3 out of 4) of school reopening studies at lower risk of bias reported no associated increases in transmission. CONCLUSIONS: School closure studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other non-pharmacological interventions implemented around the same time as school closures, and the effectiveness of closures remains uncertain. School reopenings, in areas of low transmission and with appropriate mitigation measures, were generally not accompanied by increasing community transmission. With such varied evidence on effectiveness, and the harmful effects, policymakers should take a measured approach before implementing school closures; and should look to reopen schools in times of low transmission, with appropriate mitigation measures.","output":"Do school closures and school reopenings affect community transmission of COVID-19?

Although glial populations are tightly regulated, the mechanisms regulating the population size remain poorly understood. Since Drosophila glial cells are similar to the human counterparts in their functions and shapes, rendering them an excellent model system to understand the human glia biology. Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP) are important for regulating bioactive lipids. In Drosophila, there are three known LPP-encoding genes; wunen, wunen-2 and lazaro. The wunens are important for the germ cell migration and survival, and septate junction formation during tracheal development. Lazaro is involved in phototransduction. In the present study, we characterized a novel Drosophila LPP-encoding gene, CG11426. Suppression of CG11426 increased glial cell number in the eye imaginal disc during larval development, while ectopic CG11426 expression decreased it. Both types of mutation also caused defects in axon projection to the optic lobe in larval eye-brain complexes. Moreover, CG11426 promoted apoptosis via inhibiting ERK signaling in the eye imaginal disc. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that CG11426 gene product negatively regulates ERK signaling to promote apoptosis for proper maintenance of glial population in the developing eye disc.

A total of 313 nasopharyngeal swabs (82 serial samples from 7 infected patients and 231 individual samples from 4 infected patients and 215 uninfected individuals) were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and then subjected to LUMIPULSE. We determined the cutoff value for antigen detection using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared the performance of the antigen test with that of RT-qPCR. We also compared the viral loads and antigen levels in serial samples from seven infected patients. Using RT-qPCR as the reference, the antigen test exhibited 55.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity, with a 91.4% overall agreement rate (286/313). In specimens with > 100 viral copies and between 10 and 100 copies, the antigen test showed 100% and 85% concordance with RT-qPCR, respectively. This concordance declined with lower viral loads. In the serially followed patients, the antigen levels showed a steady decline, along with viral clearance. This gradual decline was in contrast with the abrupt positive-to-negative and negative-to-positive status changes observed with RT-qPCR, particularly in the late phase of infection.

First, as iron moved down the industrial chain, its material flow decreased gradually, while the price continued to rise. Second, the annual loss of raw materials from iron processing was 150C200 million tons, and scrap iron had great potential for secondary utilization. Third, China had a trade deficit in terms of importing raw materials and exporting products, but it also had a trade surplus in trade volume. Finally, China imported iron-containing goods at high prices but exported iron-containing goods at low prices. This was due to the lack of high-end science and technology, which made China less competitive in the international market.","output":"Analysis of iron composite flow in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, experimental research groups face a unique challenge: how to train undergraduates without access to labs.

Vaccine hesitancy may be a major barrier to achieving equitable herd immunity and must be addressed to reduce the excess morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in disproportionately affected communities. This study aimed to determine if COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and its factors vaccine complacency and confidence, are more prominent among disproportionately affected racial minority groups. Methods:We collected data from participants aged 18 years or older from the four most populous U.S. states, including New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and Canada. Data were collected using a web-based survey platform. Data are available at http://www.covid19-database.com. Results:Data from 4,434 participants were included [mean (SD) age = 48.7 (17.2) and 50.4% women]. Vaccine hesitancy was higher in Black, Indigenous (Native American and Indigenous People of Canada, including First Nations, Inuit and Mtis), and Latinx compared to White participants, while no difference was found between East Asian and White participants. The group differences in vaccine hesitancy for Indigenous and Black compared to White participants remained after controlling for sociodemographic factors. Determinants of vaccine complacency were equivalent between disproportionately affected racial groups and white participants. Vaccine confidence (i.e., trust in vaccine benefit) was generally lower in all racial groups compared to White participants. Differences in vaccine mistrust comparing Black and East Asian to White participants remained after controlling for sociodemographic factors. Discussion:Disproportionately affected racial minorities may have higher vaccine hesitancy and lower confidence in COVID-19 vaccines.

This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded a panel of potent neutralizing antibodies which bind distinct viral epitopes including epitopes conserved in SARS-CoV-1. Structural determination of a non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody reveals a previously undescribed binding epitope, which is unlikely to be affected by the mutations in any of the recently reported major viral variants including B.1.1.7 (from the UK), B.1.351 (from South Africa) and B.1.1.28 (from Brazil).

This population also faces strong social stigma and legal barriers, potentially impeding participation in research. To date, few multi\\\\country longitudinal HIV research studies with MSM/TGW have been conducted in SSA. Primary objective of the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 075 study was to assess feasibility of recruiting and retaining a multinational prospective cohort of MSM/TGW in SSA for HIV prevention research. METHODS: HPTN 075, conducted from 2015 to 2017, was designed to enroll 400 MSM/TGW at four sites in SSA (100 per site: Kisumu, Kenya; Blantyre, Malawi; Cape Town, South Africa; and Soweto, South Africa). The number of HIV\\\\positive persons was capped at 20 per site; HIV\\\\positive persons already in care were excluded from participation. The one\\\\year study included five biobehavioural assessments. Community\\\\based input and risk mitigation protocols were included in study design and conduct. RESULTS: Of 624 persons screened, 401 were enrolled. One in five participants was classified as transgender. Main reasons for ineligibility included: (a) being HIV positive after the cap was reached (29.6%); (b) not reporting anal intercourse with a man in the preceding three months (20.6%); and (c) being HIV positive and already in care (17.5%). Five (1.2%) participants died during the study (unrelated to study participation). 92.9% of the eligible participants (368/396) completed the final study visit and 86.1% participated in all visits. The main, overlapping reasons for early termination included being (a) unable to adhere to the visit schedule, predominantly because of relocation (46.4%), and (b) unable to contact the participant (32.1%). Participants reported strong motivation to participate and few participation barriers. Four participants reported social harms (loss of confidentiality and sexual harassment by study staff) that were successfully addressed. CONCLUSIONS: HPTN 075 successfully enrolled a multinational sample of MSM/TGW in SSA in a prospective HIV prevention research study with a high retention rate and few documented social harms.

Traditionally, CME is delivered face-to-face, but due to geographical distances, and pressure of work in Bangladesh, general practitioners (GPs) are unable to relocate for several days to attend training. Using chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an exemplar, we aimed to assess the feasibility of blended learning (combination of face-to-face and online) for GPs, and explore trainees and trainers perspectives towards the blended learning approach. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods design. We trained 49 GPs in two groups via blended (n = 25) and traditional face-to-face approach (n = 24) and assessed their post-course knowledge and skills. The COPD Physician Practice Assessment Questionnaire (COPD-PPAQ) was administered before and one-month post-course. Verbatim transcriptions of focus group discussions with 18 course attendees and interviews with three course trainers were translated into English and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Forty GPs completed the course (Blended: 19; Traditional: 21). The knowledge and skills post course, and the improvement in self-reported adherence to COPD guidelines was similar in both groups. Most participants preferred blended learning as it was more convenient than taking time out of their busy work life, and for many the online learning optimised the benefits of the subsequent face-to-face sessions. Suggested improvements included online interactivity with tutors, improved user friendliness of the e-learning platform, and timing face-to-face classes over weekends to avoid time-out of practice. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement requires a multifaceted approach, but adequate knowledge and skills are core components. Blended learning is feasible and, with a few caveats, is an acceptable option to GPs in Bangladesh. This is timely, given that online learning with limited face-to-face contact is likely to become the norm in the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Continuing professional education for general practitioners on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: feasibility of a blended learning approach in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Insomnia is a highly prevalent disorder that is seen across all age groups causing significant morbidity to the patients. Its prevalence has further risen during COVID-19 pandemic. It is widely acknowledged that untreated insomnia can lead to significant health risks and socio-occupational dysfunction. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted following focused search of databases. RESULTS: Available guidelines mention two different approaches for the management of insomniapharmacological and non-pharmacological. Non-pharmacological therapies like multicomponent cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) have been advocated for the management of acute as well as chronic insomnia in the literature as it has been found efficacious and useful. Multiple variants of CBT-I, e.g., digitally delivered CBT-I, brief CBT-I have been tested during pandemic owing to closure of clinics. However, there are certain issues to be considered while choosing CBT-I as therapy. For example, like other forms of psychotherapies, is there a need for assessing the candidature of patient before administering CBT-I; is CBT-I free of adverse effects as commonly thought; is CBT-I more efficacious than hypnotics; and at last, how to manage cases that are not candidate for CBT-I. CONCLUSION: This narrative review addresses the scientific robustness of evidence for issues related to adherence, efficacy and adverse effects of non-pharmacological therapies. Available literature suggests that data related to adherence and efficacy of CBT-I suffer from methodological shortcomings and careful selection of patient is important for the successful therapy.

Studies on the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have largely focused on students learning and well-being. In contrast, little is known about how emergency online teaching affects teachers. The aim of this study was to examine how disrupted teaching contexts during the Covid-19 pandemic affected academic teacher identities in health science education. Interviews were conducted with 19 experienced lecturers in health science education from two universities. Interview data were analysed using systematic text condensation. The established codes were compared across interviews to identify common themes and subsequently synthesized into descriptions of the emerging phenomena. Findings indicated that a form of embodied teacher identity, i.e. internalized teaching practices turned into dispositions, constituted a basic pedagogical condition and a resource for the teachers, and that the sudden change in the teaching context caused a loss of teacher identity. This identity loss was related to an incorporated understanding and use of the teachers sense of the classroom (subtheme 1), non-verbal feedback from students (subtheme 2) and reciprocal visual contact (subtheme 3). Data also indicated that teachers ability to adapt their teaching to students needs while teaching and teachers motivation and job satisfaction may have suffered. Universities should carefully consider how to cultivate sustainable and adaptive teacher identities compatible with the increasing digitalization of learning environments.

Quercetin is flavonoid that occurs naturally in plants and is widely used as a nutritional supplement due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated antioxidant activities and mechanisms of action in zymosan-induced macrophages of quercetin and quercetin-related flavonoids such as quercitrin, isoquercitrin, quercetin 3-O--(2-galloyl)-rhamnopyranoside (QGR) and quercetin 3-O--(2-galloyl)-glucopyranoside (QGG) as well as gallic acid, a building moiety of QGR and QGG. QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities compared with quercetin, whereas quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid exhibited weak-tono antioxidant activities, assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, superoxide production, superoxide scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) production, peroxynitrite (ONOO(?)) scavenging and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Regarding mechanisms, the quercetincontaining flavonoids QGR and QGG differentially targeted compared with quercetin in the NF-B signaling pathway that inhibited the DNA binding activity of the NF-B complex without affecting the degradation and phosphorylation of IB and NF-B phosphorylation. In addition, QGR and QGG inhibited CRE and activator protein (AP-1) transcriptional activity and JNK phosphorylation by inhibiting the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in a different manner than quercetin.

Risk factors for death are not yet fully identified. Objectives: The present study aimed at comparing the clinical manifestations and risk factors for death between two groups of patients with COVID-19 aged under and above 50 in Qom Province, Iran. Methods: The current retrospective cohort study was conducted on 178 patients with COVID-19 in Qom Province. Patients were fol-lowed up until recovery or death. The source population was divided into four groups, of which 45 patients were randomly enrolled in the study. The first group included patients aged less than 50 discharged after recovery;the second group included patients less than 50 years who died from COVID-19;the third group consisted of patients above 50 discharged after recovery, and the fourth group included patients above 50 who died from COVID-19. The data, including COVID-19 clinical symptoms and presumptive risk factors for death, were collected and compared between groups. Results: The most common symptoms in hospitalized patients were shortness of breath (82.6%), cough (73.6%), and fever (71.9%), respectively. In the age group above 50, the prevalence of fever in the recovered subjects was higher than that of the ones who died from the disease (81.8% Vs. 53.3%). Headache and loss of senses of smell and taste were also more common in both age groups in the recovered subjects. In the age group under 50, subjects who died had higher BMI values, but in the age group above 50, subjects who died had lower BMIs.

On the other hand, the impact of NHT on the pattern of biochemical recurrence (BCR) is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively examined 1749 consecutive patients who underwent RP between 1996 and 2017. Among the patients who met the inclusion criteria, BCR developed in 240 of non-NHT patients and in 120 of NHT patients during the mean follow-up period of 6.9 years. We examined the impact of NHT on the PSA-doubling time (DT) following BCR at different times after RP. RESULTS: The median PSA-DTs in non-NHT patients who experienced BCR in the first year after surgery, between 1 and 2 years, between 2 and 3 years, between 3 and 4 years, between 4 and 5 years, and at > 5 years were 5.5, 8.8, 11.3, 17.7, 18.2, and 18.4 months, respectively. On the other hand, those in NHT patients were 1.4, 4.1, 9.1, 13.4, 27.2, and 19.3 months, respectively. The differences of PSA-DTs in the first year after surgery (p < 0.001) and between 1 and 2 years (p = 0.005) were significant between non-NHT and NHT patients. CONCLUSION: Patients who received NHT had a higher risk of a rapid PSA increase when they experienced BCR, especially within 2 years after RP. In order to not miss the optimal timing of salvage treatment for BCR, intensive PSA follow-up is necessary.

South Africa has adopted task shifting health care to Community Health Workers (CHWs) to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, but little is known about CHWs' efficacy in rural areas. METHODS In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, almost all mothers giving birth (N = 470) in the Zithulele Hospital catchment area of the OR Tambo District were recruited and repeatedly assessed for 2 years after birth with 84.7-96% follow-up rates. During the cohort assessment we found that some mothers had received standard antenatal and HIV care (SC) (n = 313 mothers), while others had received SC, supplemented with home-visiting by CHWs before and after birth (HV) (n = 157 mothers, 37 CHWs). These visits were unrelated to the cohort study. Multiple linear and logistic regressions evaluated maternal comorbidities, maternal caretaking, and child development outcomes over time. RESULTS Compared to mothers receiving SC, mothers who also received home visits by CHWs were more likely to attend the recommended four antenatal care visits, to exclusively breastfeed at 3 months, and were less likely to consult traditional healers at 3 months. Mothers in both groups were equally likely to secure the child grant, and infant growth and achievement of developmental milestones were similar over the first 2 years of life.

The secondary objective is to describe the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic in FVG and in the Regions of Northern and Central Italy in terms of incidence and mortality compared to the national data. DESIGN retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS resident population in FVG in the period between 29 February and 25 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES in order to describe the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in FVG, in terms of incidence and mortality compared to the national data, the standardized incidence (SIR) and mortality (SMR) ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated compared to the Italian population for the northern and central Regions of Italy and the autonomous Provinces (PA) of Trento and Bolzano. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on subjects residing in FVG to whom at least one naso-oropharyngeal swab (hereafter, named swab) resulted positive for Covid-19. For each subject included in the cohort, the observation period started with the first positive swab and ended with the first of the following events: death, recovery or censored, which means that at the end of the observation period the subject was still alive and positive. The cause of death was assigned to Covid-19 if a subject had not yet recovered at the time when the event occurred. Cohort members were considered recovered after two negative consecutive swabs. The sub-hazard ratio (SHR) was estimated by applying the regression model of competing risks by Fine and Gray, in which the event of interest was the death caused by Covid-19 and the competing event was recovery. The explanatory variables included in the multiple models are: gender, age at the beginning of the observation period, the Province of residence, and nursing home residency. The cause-specific hazard was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS during the observation period, 3,305 cases and 345 deaths were recorded in FVG; SIR and SMR resulted, respectively, equal to 0.64 (95%CI 0.61-0.68) and 0.43 (95%CI 0.37-0.50). The FVG was the Northern Region one with the lowest incidence and mortality. The cohort consisted of 3,121 residents in FVG with at least one swab with a positive Covid-19 result during the study period. The SHR of dying for Covid-19 is equal to 16.13 (95%CI 9.73-26.74) for people with age 70-79 years and 35.58 (95%CI 21.77-58.15) with age >=80 years respect those with age <70 years. It is higher in males (SHR 1.71; 95%CI 1.34-2.17). There is no evidence that being resident in a nursing home affects the SHR (SHR 0.91 and 95%CI 0.69-1.20). As regards the province as an explanatory variable, the sub-hazard of death in the province of Trieste appears to overlap to the sub-hazard of Pordenone used as a reference; for the provinces of Udine and Gorizia the sub-hazards seem lower than the reference. CONCLUSIONS while other Northern Regions and autonomous Provinces show higher standardized incidence and mortality compared with Italy, FVG and Veneto do not. In FVG, male gender and age are important determinants of death while there is no evidence that the condition of guest in a nursing home increases the sub-hazard of death.","output":"[Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (Northern Italy): assessment of factors associated with the risk of death by competing risks analysis]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emergency care in Germany is in transition.

Methods: A large multi-centre prospective cohort was recruited from publicly funded hospital staff in the UK. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed fortnightly questionnaires on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive or prior PCR/antibody test positive) or negative cohort (antibody negative, not previously known to be PCR/antibody positive). Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, possible (subdivided by symptom-status)) depending on hierarchy of evidence. Individuals in the primary infection were excluded from this analysis if infection was confirmed by antibody only. Reinfection rates in the positive cohort were compared against new PCR positives in the negative cohort using a mixed effective multivariable logistic regression analysis. Findings: Between 18 June and 09 November 2020, 44 reinfections (2 probable, 42 possible) were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 6,614 participants, collectively contributing 1,339,078 days of follow-up. This compares with 318 new PCR positive infections and 94 antibody seroconversions in the negative cohort of 14,173 participants, contributing 1,868,646 days of follow-up. The incidence density per 100,000 person days between June and November 2020 was 3.3 reinfections in the positive cohort, compared with 22.4 new PCR confirmed infections in the negative cohort. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 for all reinfections (95% CI 0.13-0.24) compared to PCR confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was over 160 days.

Here we apply for the first time phylogenetic methods and Partition Analysis of Quasispecies (PAQ) to monitor genetic distances and intra-population structures of mutant spectra of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) quasispecies subjected to mutagenesis by base and nucleoside analogues. RESULTS: Phylogenetic and PAQ analyses have revealed a highly dynamic variation of intrapopulation diversity of FMDV quasispecies. The population diversity first suffers striking expansions in the presence of mutagens and then compressions either when the presence of the mutagenic analogue was discontinued or when a mutation that decreased sensitivity to a mutagen was selected. The pattern of mutations found in the populations was in agreement with the behavior of the corresponding nucleotide analogues with FMDV in vitro. Mutations accumulated at preferred genomic sites, and dn/ds ratios indicate the operation of negative (or purifying) selection in populations subjected to mutagenesis. No evidence of unusually elevated genetic distances has been obtained for FMDV populations approaching extinction. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic and PAQ analysis provide adequate procedures to describe the evolution of viral sequences subjected to lethal mutagenesis. These methods define the changes of intra-population structure more precisely than mutation frequencies and Shannon entropies. PAQ is very sensitive to variations of intrapopulation genetic distances. Strong negative (or purifying) selection operates in FMDV populations subjected to enhanced mutagenesis. The quantifications provide evidence that extinction does not imply unusual increases of intrapopulation complexity, in support of the lethal defection model of virus extinction.","output":"Topology of evolving, mutagenized viral populations: quasispecies expansion, compression, and operation of negative selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has become the standard procedure for treating patents with adrenal masses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of the LigaSure vessel closure system during laparoscopic adrenalectomy. METHODS The LigaSure device was used in 32 patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal masses. Adrenalectomy was carried out without the use of clips or sutures for vessel closure. In 1 patient the adrenal tumor had invaded the ipsilateral kidney, so laparoscopic nephrectomy was also carried out during the same operation. In another patient, a renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney had metastasized to the right adrenal gland. Both the kidney and the contralateral adrenal gland were removed laparoscopically during the same operation. RESULTS Adrenal masses had a mean greatest diameter of 3.48 cm (range 2 to 11 cm). Mean operative time was 83.2 minutes (range 30 to 190 min). Mean blood loss was 36.2 mL (range 10 to 140 mL). No conversions to open surgery were necessary. No patients experienced major bleeding intraoperatively or postoperatively. Adrenal tumor types included adrenocortical adenoma (16 patients), pheochromocytoma (13 patients), malignant pheochromocytoma (1 patient), chromophobic carcinoma (1 patient), and metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma (1 patient).

METHOD Text was extracted from five webpages per website and eight text readability factors were measured, including the Flesch Reading Ease and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. The relationship between readability and a practice population's level of deprivation, measured using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), was assessed. Overall, 10 design factors contributing to readability and accessibility were scored. RESULTS In total, 86.4% (n = 813/941) of Scottish practices had a website; 22.9% (n = 874/3823) of webpages were written at, or below, the government-recommended reading level for online content (9-14 years old), and the content of the remaining websites, 77.1% (n = 2949/3823), was suitable for a higher reading age. Of all webpages, 80.5% (n = 3077/3823) were above the recommended level for easy-to-understand 'plain English'. There was no statistically significant association between webpage reading age and SIMD. Only 6.7% (n = 51/764) of websites achieved all design and accessibility recommendations. CONCLUSION Changes to practice websites could improve readability and promote health literacy, but practices will need financial resources and ongoing technical support if this is to be achieved and maintained. Failure to provide readable and accessible websites may widen health inequalities; the topic will become increasingly important as online service use accelerates.","output":"The readability of general practice websites: a cross-sectional analysis of all general practice websites in Scotland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDS: High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is an alternative therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed first to describe outcomes of patients suffering from COVID-19-related ARDS treated with HFNC; secondly to evaluate safety of HFNC (patients and healthcare workers) and compare patients according to respiratory outcome. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was conducted in French general hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were included if receiving HFNC for hypoxemia (saturation pulse oxygen (SpO2) <92% under oxygen a??6 L/min) associated with ARDS and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Main clinical characteristics and outcomes are described in patients: (a) with do not intubate order (HFNC-DNIO); (b) who did not need intubation (HFNC-only); and (c) eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation). Medians are presented with (1st-3rd) interquartile range. RESULTS: From 26 February to 30 June 2020, 46 patients of median age 75 (70-79) years were included. In the HFNC-DNIO group (n = 11), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2) ratio median worst PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 109 (102-172) and hospital mortality was 54.5%. Except the HFNC-DNIO patients (n = 35), 20 patients (57%) were eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation group) and 15 were only treated by HFNC (HFNC-only). HFNC-intubation patients presented higher worst respiratory rates per minute in ICU [37 (34-41) versus 33 (24-34) min, p < 0.05] and worsened ICU admission PaO2/FiO2 ratios [121 (103-169) versus 191 (162-219), p < 0.001] compared with HFNC-only patients. Hospital mortality was 35% (n = 7/20) in HFNC-intubation group, 0% in HFNC-only group with a global mortality of these two groups of 20% (n = 7/35). Among tests performed in healthcare workers, 1/12 PCR in symptomatic healthcare workers and 1.8% serologies in asymptomatic healthcare workers were positive. After review of each case, COVID-19 was likely to be acquired outside hospital. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC seems to be useful for COVID-19-related ARDS and safe for healthcare workers. ARDS severity with PaO2/FiO2 <150 associated with respiratory rate >35/min could be regarded as a predictor of intubation.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","output":"High flow nasal cannula oxygenation in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome: a safe way to avoid endotracheal intubation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective biopreservation measures are needed to control the growth of postprocess Listeria monocytogenes contamination in fresh whey cheeses stored under refrigeration. This study assessed growth and biocontrol of inoculated (3 log10 CFU/g) L. monocytogenes in vacuum-packed, fresh (1-day-old) or 'aged' (15-day-old) Anthotyros whey cheeses, without or with 5% of a crude enterocin A-B-P extract (CEntE), during storage at 4 C. Regardless of CEntE addition, the pathogen increased by an average of 2.0 log10 CFU/g in fresh cheeses on day 15. Gram-negative spoilage bacteria also increased by an average of 2.5 log10 CFU/g. However, from day 15 to the sell-by date (days 35-40), L. monocytogenes growth ceased, and progressively, the populations of the pathogen declined in most cheeses. This was due to an unmonitored, batch-dependent natural acidification by spoilage lactic acid bacteria, predominantly Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which reduced the cheese pH to 5.5, and finally to 5.0. The pH reductions and associated declines in pathogen viability were greater in the CEntE-treated samples within each batch. L. monocytogenes failed to grow in cheeses previously 'aged' in retail for 15 days. Overall, high population levels (>7.5 log10 CFU/g) of psychrotrophic Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Hafnia alvei, were associated with an extended growth and increased survival of L. monocytogenes during storage.","output":"Growth and Biocontrol of Listeria monocytogenes in Greek Anthotyros Whey Cheese without or with a Crude Enterocin A-B-P Extract: Interactive Effects of the Native Spoilage Microbiota during Vacuum-Packed Storage at 4 C"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In children, the infection with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, tends to be clinically inapparent more often or less severe than in adults The spread of this infection from children poses a danger to vulnerable adults Therefore, child care institutions and schools currently are widely closed METHODS: Since the status of infection tends to be congruent in mothers and their children, we tested 401 mothers of children between 1 and 10 years in the city of Rostock (State of Mecklenburg-Westpomerania, northeast of Germany), for the presence of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, and of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum RESULTS: In none of the mothers tested, RNA of this virus was detected in the throat swab In the ELISA test, IgG antibodies were positive in one serum sample, IgA antibodies were positive in 11, and borderline in 3 serum samples All 401 sera were negative in the indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) with FITC-labeled IgG, IgA, und IgM antibodies CONCLUSION: At the time of this study, neither SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nor specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in the mothers tested in Rostock","output":"Mtter-Screening in einem COVID-19-Niedrig-Pandemiegebiet: Bestimmung SARS-CoV-2-spezifischer Antik?rper bei 401 Rostocker Mttern mittels ELISA und Immunfluoreszenz-Best?tigungstest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indiscriminatory in its spread, COVID-19 has engulfed communities from all social backgrounds throughout the world.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was implemented between January 02, 2021 and April 29, 2021. A total of 789 breast cancer patients from eight hospitals in Liaoning province were selected for participation in this study. These participants completed questionnaires, which included the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory, EGO Resilience Scale and the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery. The associated factors of PTG were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression (HMR). The proposed relationships among resilience, recovery, and PTG were checked by structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses. RESULTS: The average PTG score of breast cancer patients was 53.00  28.30. PTG was positively correlated with both recovery and PTG (a*b = 0.1, BCa95% CI: 0.154  0.054). CONCLUSION: Breast cancer patients were found to exhibit a moderate degree of PTG.

Media play a critical role during pandemics by affecting values, opinions, public knowledge about stigmatized groups. When media ignore and stereotypically represent a social group, the social value of the group decreases, and their problems are trivialized. METHOD: I analyzed data provided by Media Monitoring Center which is an independent media company in Turkey. Sample was selected to reveal news representation of Syrian refugees between March 11, 2020 (the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Turkey) and August 20, 2020 (the time of this research). Mostly watched television evening (prime) news, the most widely circulated newspapers, and the most visited online news platforms were analyzed. By using content analysis method, the news stories about Syrian refugees were examined. RESULTS: It has been revealed that Turkish news media overwhelmingly acclaimed for Turkeys polices on Syrian refugees and the criticized the European Union policies towards refugees in the news stories. Even though almost 4 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey, with the largest refugee population in the world, Turkish news media ignored the plight of Syrian refugees. CONCLUSION: Results of the study demonstrate that Syrian refugees were symbolically annihilated by Turkish news media during the COVID-19 pandemic. The concealment of information and symbolic annihilation of disadvantaged groups could potentially cause health disparities and irreparable harm to public health. Moreover, inequities exacerbate when predicaments of stigmatized groups are ignored in the news media. Further studies are needed to reveal the impact of the media on health disparities among stigmatized groups during the pandemics.","output":"Symbolic annihilation of Syrian refugees by Turkish news media during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Researchers across the world are emphasising the importance of hand-washing and limited touching of face to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, access to safe water and hygiene is inadequate in many places around the globe; hence T-zone touching restriction is considered more worthwhile compared to other prevention strategies. AIM: A systematic review was carried out to appraise the frequency of T-zone (eyes, nose, mouth, chin) touching in humans to comprehend the challenge of its restriction, and thus support public health professionals to produce evidence synthesis guidance for public. For this systemic review, data were collected by keyword searching, and several online databases were searched.

DESIGN: This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of a video review program conducted at a single institution from July 2016 to November 2019. SETTING: Surgical and Trauma ICU at a single urban academic quaternary care center. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the surgical and trauma ICU between July 2016 and November 2019 were eligible for the study as all ICU beds in our health system institutions are equipped with closed circuit video/audio monitoring. Through an institutional review board approved program, any event triggering the immediate bedside presence of a provider in the ICU is routinely recorded at the discretion of the care team or tele-intensivist. INTERVENTIONS: A database of these events was created over a 3-year period, and cases were reviewed for content, quality improvement, and educational opportunities. Select recordings were analyzed and shared at multidisciplinary/multiprofessional video review sessions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 286 critical events video recorded and reviewed in the ICUs between July 2016 and November 2019. The most commonly recorded events included: cardiopulmonary arrests (n = 75), intubations (n = 71), and acute clinical decompensation triggered by nonreassuring vital signs (n = 57) or arrhythmias (n = 13). Of these recordings, 59 were shared at video review conferences, where quality of care was assessed and thematic opportunities for improvement were characterized. Recurrent quality improvement themes that were identified included adherence to protocols, the importance of teamwork and closed-loop communication, clearly designated team leadership, and the use of universal precautions.

In the present study 205 tracheal swabs and organs were collected from broilers and layers chicken farms during January to August 2012 from 19 governorates all over Egypt. The chickens demonstrated respiratory signs and mortality. Out of the examined samples, 130 of which (about 64%) of suspected farms were positive for IBV with real time RT-PCR. 13 IBV-positive samples were selected for further isolation and characterization. Isolation in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryos was carried out after studies three blind successive passages and the hypervariable region of spike protein1 (SP1) was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to study the genetic diversity between the isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences of 13 isolates compared with other IBV strains from the Middle East and worldwide reveled that 11 out of the 13 isolates had close relationship the Israeli variants (IS/885 and IS/1494/06) with nucleotide homology reached up to 89.9% and 82.3%, respectively. Only two isolates had close relationship with CR/88121 and 4/91 viruses with identities of 95% and 96%, respectively. This study indicates existence of two variant groups of IBV circulating in Egypt during 2012. Group I was similar but distinguishable from Israeli variant IS/885 and group II was related to 4/91 and CR/88121 vaccine strains.

During ischemia, succinate accumulates and its oxidation upon reperfusion by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) drives ROS production. Inhibition of succinate accumulation and/or oxidation by dimethyl malonate (DMM), a cell permeable prodrug of the SDH inhibitor malonate, can decrease I/R injury. However, DMM is hydrolysed slowly, requiring administration to the heart prior to ischemia, precluding its administration to patients at the point of reperfusion, for example at the same time as unblocking a coronary artery following a heart attack. To accelerate malonate delivery, here we developed more rapidly hydrolysable malonate esters. METHODS: We synthesised a series of malonate esters and assessed their uptake and hydrolysis by isolated mitochondria, C2C12 cells and in mice in vivo. In addition, we assessed protection against cardiac I/R injury by the esters using an in vivo mouse model of acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: We found that the diacetoxymethyl malonate diester (MAM) most rapidly delivered large amounts of malonate to cells in vivo. Furthermore, MAM could inhibit mitochondrial ROS production from succinate oxidation and was protective against I/R injury in vivo when added at reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The rapidly hydrolysed malonate prodrug MAM can protect against cardiac I/R injury in a clinically relevant mouse model.","output":"Ester Prodrugs of Malonate with Enhanced Intracellular Delivery Protect Against Cardiac Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury In Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structural racism manifests as an historical and continued invisibility of Asian Americans, whose experiences of disparities and diverse needs are omitted in research, data, and policy. During the pandemic, this invisibility intersects with rising anti-Asian violence and other persistent structural inequities that contribute to higher COVID-19 mortality in older Asian Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites. This perspective describes how structural inequities in social determinants of healthnamely immigration, language and telehealth access, and economic conditionslead to increased COVID-19 mortality and barriers to care among older Asian Americans. Specifically, we discuss how the historically racialized immigration system has patterned older Asian immigrant subpopulations into working in frontline essential occupations with high COVID-19 exposure. The threat of public charge rule has also prevented Asian immigrants from receiving eligible public assistance including COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs. We highlight the language diversity among older Asian Americans and how language access remains unaddressed in clinical and non-clinical services and creates barriers to routine and COVID-19 related care, particularly in geographic regions with small Asian American populations. We discuss the economic insecurity of older Asian immigrants and how co-residence in multigenerational homes has exposed them to greater risk of coronavirus transmission. Using an intersectionality-informed approach to address structural inequities, we recommend the disaggregation of racial/ethnic data, meaningful inclusion of older Asian Americans in research and policy, and equitable investment in community and multi-sectoral partnerships to improve health and wellbeing of older Asian Americans.","output":"The Impact of Structural Inequities on Older Asian Americans During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fundamental question for society is how much happiness does a dollar buy? The accepted view among economists and psychologists is that income has diminishing marginal returns on happiness: money and happiness increase together up to a point after which there is relatively little further gain. In this paper we estimate the relationship between income and subjective wellbeing over a 19-year period focusing on where the greatest change in the marginal return on income occurs and whether this change point has shifted over time. We formally test for the presence of a change point as well as temporal changes in the relationship between income and affective wellbeing (happiness), and income and cognitive wellbeing (life satisfaction), using household economic data from Australia between 2001 and 2019. The results indicate that the change point between affective wellbeing and income has increased over those 19 years faster than inflation (i.e., cost of living).

There is no approved drug for the definitive treatment of the disease. Various drugs are being tried for the treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). This study was performed to systematically review the therapeutic role of HCQ in COVID-19 from the available literature. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP (WHO), Cochrane Library databases, and two pre-print servers (medRxiv.org and Research Square) were searched for clinical studies that evaluated the therapeutic role of HCQ on COVID-19 until 10 May 2020. The available studies were critically analyzed and the data were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 663 articles were screened and 12 clinical studies (seven peer-reviewed and published studies and five non-peer-reviewed studies from pre-print servers) with a total sample size of 3543 patients were included. Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations. Some of the other studies showed negative results with HCQ therapy along with the risk of adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations. Stronger evidence from well-designed robust randomized clinical trials is required before conclusively determining the role of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.

It is characterized by a reduction of serum T3 (fT3), sometimes followed by reduction of serum T4 (fT4). The relationship between thyroid hormones levels and mortality is well known and different studies showed a direct association between NTIS and mortality. The sudden spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV 2) infection (COVID-19) and its high mortality become a world healthcare problem. Our aim in this paper was to investigate if patients affected by COVID-19 presented NTIS and the relationship between thyroid function and severity of this infection. METHODS: We evaluated the thyroid function in two different groups of consecutive patients affected by COVID-19 with respect to a control group of euthyroid patients. Group A included patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia while patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory syndrome formed the group B. Group C identified the control group of euthyroid patients. RESULTS: Patients from group A and group B showed a statistically significant reduction in fT3 and TSH compared to group C. In group B, compared to group A, a further statistically significant reduction of fT3 and TSH was found. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in-patients can present NTIS.

However, vaccine hesitancy might hinder high uptake rates and thus undermine efforts to eliminate COVID-19 once an effective vaccine became available. The present contribution addresses this issue by examining two ways of increasing the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. METHOD Two preregistered online studies were conducted (N = 2,315 participants from the United Kingdom) in which knowledge about and beliefs in herd immunity through vaccination, as well as empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus, were either measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). As a dependent variable, individuals' self-reported vaccination intention once a vaccine against COVID-19 became available was assessed. RESULTS In Study 1 (N = 310), the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was correlated with knowledge about and belief in herd immunity through vaccination (r = .58, p < .001), as well as with empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus (r = .26, p < .001). In Study 2 (N = 2,005), information about herd immunity through vaccination (Cohen's d = .13, p = .003) and empathy (Cohen's d = .22, p < .001) independently promoted vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS The motivation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was related to and could be causally promoted by both mere information about herd immunity through vaccination and by empathy. As such, the present research provides a better understanding of the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

The rate of perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI), as defined according to the RIFLE criteria, and the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were compared between users and nonusers. Oncologic outcomes and rate of progression were compared between users and nonusers. RESULTS One hundred four (31%) of 339 patients were on statin therapy preoperatively and continued this medication peri- and postoperatively. Statin patients were older and had higher rates of comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension (p<0.0001 for all).The rate of AKI in the statin (16%) and nonstatin patients (14%) (p=0.60) and CKD progression based on Kaplan-Meier estimates (p=0.57) were similar between both the groups.

The small sample and limited genomic characterizations have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3' end. ORF8 also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human viruses.

We compared their histology with infants with classic ACDMPV and compared their outcomes with infants transplanted for other indications. RESULTS: In contrast to neonates with classic ACDPMV who present with severe hypoxemia and refractory pulmonary hypertension within hours of birth, none of the infants with atypical ACDMPV presented with progressive neonatal respiratory failure. Three infants had mild neonatal respiratory distress and received nasal cannula oxygen. Three other infants had no respiratory symptoms at birth and presented with hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension at 2C3 months of age. Bilateral lung transplantation was performed at 4C20 months.

Current state of the art predictions of future daily deaths and, especially, hospital resource usage have confidence intervals that are unacceptably wide. Policy makers and hospitals require accurate forecasts to make informed decisions on passing legislation and allocating resources. We used US county-level data on daily deaths and population statistics to forecast future deaths. We extended the SIR epidemiological model to a novel model we call the PECAIQR model. It adds several new variables and parameters to the naive SIR model by taking into account the ramifications of the partial quarantining implemented in the US. We fitted data to the model parameters with numerical integration. Because of the fit degeneracy in parameter space and non-constant nature of the parameters, we developed several methods to optimize our fit, such as training on the data tail and training on specific policy regimes. We use cross-validation to tune our hyper parameters at the county level and generate a CDF for future daily deaths.

People with HIV have a higher risk of developing HPV infection and HPV-associated cancers due to a lower immune response, and due to viral interactions. We performed a systematic review of RCTs to assess HPV vaccines efficacy and safety on HIV-infected people compared to placebo or no intervention in terms of seroconversion, infections, neoplasms, adverse events, CD4+ T-cell count and HIV viral load. The vaccine-group showed a seroconversion rate close to 100% for each vaccine and a significantly higher level of antibodies against HPV vaccine types, as compared to the placebo group (MD = 4333.3, 95% CI 2701.4; 5965.1 GMT EL.U./ml for HPV type 16 and MD = 1408.8, 95% CI 414.8; 2394.7 GMT EL.U./ml for HPV type 18).

We report the progression and clinical significance of liver derangement in a large cohort of SARS patient. METHODS Serial assay of serum ALT was followed in patients who fulfilled the WHO criteria of SARS. Those with elevated ALT were compared with those with normal liver functions for clinical outcome. Serology for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was checked. Adverse outcomes were defined as oxygen desaturation, need of intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation and death. RESULTS Two hundred and ninety-four patients were included in this study. Seventy (24%) patients had elevated serum ALT on admission and 204 (69%) patients had elevated ALT during the subsequent course of illness. Using peak ALT >5XULN as a cut-off and after adjusting for potential confounding factors, the odds ratio of peak ALT >5X ULN for oxygen desaturation was 3.24 (95%CI 1.23-8.59, P = 0.018), ICU care was 3.70 (95%CI 1.38-9.89, P = 0.009), mechanical ventilation was 6.64 (95%CI 2.22-19.81, P = 0.001) and death was 7.34 (95%CI 2.28-24.89, P = 0.001).

In this paper, we examine transfer learning of pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) and then transfer it to detect retinal problems from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. In this study, pretrained CNN models, namely, VGG16, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, and Xception, are used to classify seven different retinal diseases from a dataset of images with and without retinal diseases. In addition, to choose optimum values for hyperparameters, Bayesian optimization is applied, and image augmentation is used to increase the generalization capabilities of the developed models. This research also provides a comparison of the proposed models as well as an analysis of them. The accuracy achieved using DenseNet201 on the Retinal OCT Image dataset is more than 99% and offers a good level of accuracy in classifying retinal diseases compared to other approaches, which only detect a small number of retinal diseases.","output":"Diagnosis of Retinal Diseases Based on Bayesian Optimization Deep Learning Network Using Optical Coherence Tomography Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Large contiguous gene deletions at the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 9 result in the complex multi-organ condition chromosome 9p deletion syndrome. A range of clinical features can result from these deletions with the most common being facial dysmorphisms and neurological impairment. Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rarely reported feature of the syndrome with the genetic mechanism for the dysregulated insulin secretion being unknown. Methods: We studied the clinical and genetic characteristics of 12 individuals with chromosome 9p deletions who had a history of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Using off-target reads generated from targeted next-generation sequencing of the genes known to cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (n=9), or microarray analysis (n=3), we mapped the minimal shared deleted region on chromosome 9 in this cohort. Targeted sequencing was performed in three patients to search for a recessive mutation unmasked by the deletion. Results: In 10/12 patients with hypoglycaemia, hyperinsulinism was confirmed biochemically. A range of extra-pancreatic features were also reported in these patients consistent with the diagnosis of the Chromosome 9p deletion syndrome. The minimal deleted region was mapped to 7.2 Mb, encompassing 38 protein-coding genes. In silico analysis of these genes highlighted SMARCA2 and RFX3 as potential candidates for the hypoglycaemia. Targeted sequencing performed on three of the patients did not identify a second disease-causing variant within the minimal deleted region. Conclusions: This study identifies 9p deletions as an important cause of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and increases the number of cases reported with 9p deletions and hypoglycaemia to 15 making this a more common feature of the syndrome than previously appreciated. Whilst the precise genetic mechanism of the dysregulated insulin secretion could not be determined in these patients, mapping the deletion breakpoints highlighted potential candidate genes for hypoglycaemia within the deleted region.","output":"Refinement of the critical genomic region for hypoglycaemia in the Chromosome 9p deletion syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 infection, a ravaging disease attributed to a SARS-CoV-like illness, has brought the world to its knee, causing a pandemic, with human-human transmission as a major source of the spread of this ailment.

STUDY DESIGN: Trends in whether prenatal care visits were conducted in-person or via telehealth were analyzed by week for a 5-week period from March 9 to April 12 at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)-affiliated prenatal practices in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Visits were analyzed for maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) and general obstetrical faculty practices, as well as a clinic system serving patients with public insurance. The proportion of visits that were telehealth was analyzed by visit type by week. A survey and semistructured interviews of providers were conducted evaluating resources and obstacles in the uptake of telehealth. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 4,248 visits, of which approximately one-third were performed by telehealth (n = 1,352, 31.8%). By the fifth week, 56.1% of generalist visits, 61.5% of MFM visits, and 41.5% of clinic visits were performed via telehealth. A total of 36 providers completed the survey and 11 were interviewed. Accessing technology and performing visits, documentation, and follow-up using the telehealth electronic medical record were all viewed favorably by providers. In transitioning to telehealth, operational challenges were more significant for health clinics than for MFM and generalist faculty practices with patients receiving public insurance experiencing greater difficulties and barriers to care. Additional resources on the patient and operational level were required to optimize attendance at in-person and video visits for clinic patients. CONCLUSION: Telehealth was rapidly implemented in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and was viewed favorably by providers. Limited barriers to care were observed for practices serving patients with commercial insurance. However, to optimize access for patients with Medicaid, additional patient-level and operational supports were required. KEY POINTS:  Telehealth uptake differed based on insurance..

Detection of pathogens triggers intracellular defense mechanisms, such as the secretion of cytokines or chemokines to alarm neighboring cells and attract or activate immune cells. The innate immune response to viruses is mostly based on PRRs that detect the unusual structure, modification or location of viral nucleic acids. Most of the highly pathogenic and emerging viruses are RNA genome-based viruses, which can give rise to zoonotic and epidemic diseases or cause viral hemorrhagic fever. As viral RNA is located in the same compartment as host RNA, PRRs in the cytosol have to discriminate between viral and endogenous RNA by virtue of their structure or modification. This challenging task is taken on by the homologous cytosolic DExD/H-box family helicases RIG-I and MDA5, which control the innate immune response to most RNA viruses.

Binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with subsequent vaccine uptake. Content analysis was used to investigate the main reasons behind future vaccine intentions (T2). Changes in beliefs and attitudes were investigated using analysis of variance. Findings: At T2, 90.0% (95% CI 88.2%-91.7%) of participants had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, 2.2% (95% CI 1.3%-3.0%) had received one dose, and 7.4% (95% CI 5.9%-8.9%) had not been vaccinated.

It was associated with many advantages over open surgery, such as decreased postoperative pain, faster recovery, shorter hospital stay and excellent cosmesis. Since two decades single-incision endoscopic surgery (SIES) was introduced to the surgical community. SIES could possibly result in even better postoperative outcomes than multi-port laparoscopic surgery, especially concerning cosmetic outcomes and pain. However, the single-incision surgical procedure is associated with quite some challenges. METHODS An expert panel of surgeons has been selected and invited to participate in the preparation of the material for a consensus meeting on the topic SIES, which was held during the EAES congress in Frankfurt, June 16, 2017. The material presented during the consensus meeting was based on evidence identified through a systematic search of literature according to a pre-specified protocol. Three main topics with respect to SIES have been identified by the panel: (1) General, (2) Organ specific, (3) New development. Within each of these topics, subcategories have been defined. Evidence was graded according to the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence. Recommendations were made according to the GRADE criteria. RESULTS In general, there is a lack of high level evidence and a lack of long-term follow-up in the field of single-incision endoscopic surgery. In selected patients, the single-incision approach seems to be safe and effective in terms of perioperative morbidity. Satisfaction with cosmesis has been established to be the main advantage of the single-incision approach. Less pain after single-incision approach compared to conventional laparoscopy seems to be considered an advantage, although it has not been consistently demonstrated across studies.

The next logical step would be to also offer remote-controlled interventions which the expert operator not on site, but in support of the local team. This is especially valuable for complex interventions when either patient or expert operator can not be present at the same place. PURPOSE: We aimed to demonstrate that an expert operator located at far distance (Austria) could directly interact with the remote magnetic navigation system in London (UK) whilst mapping a 3D phantom using an electroanatomical mapping system. METHOD: Two experienced operators of the magnetic navigation system were tasked with creating fast anatomic maps (FAM) of the atrial and ventricular chambers of a 3D phantom using remote magnetic navigation in combination with 3D electroanatomical mapping. One was located in the control room of the magnetic catheter lab (UK) and the second one was in Tirol, Austria and connected through a secure remote desktop connection (via high speed fibre optic cable). Using a solid tip magnetic catheter connected to a mechanical drive, all interactions with the system were carried out via the Odyssey platform. Acquisitions for right and left atrium, as well as right and left ventricles plus aorta was compared with regards to mapping duration, map completeness (as judged by the average distance of surface points from 3D CT scan reconstruction), total 3D map volume and need for additional radiation exposure during the mapping process. RESULTS: Mapping time and map completeness when performed by the distant operator was not inferior to the local operator and both did not require any additional radiation exposure during the mapping process. Table 1 demonstrates the mean parameters for each chamber, respectively.

CONCLUSION: Telerobotic 3D mapping of a 3D phantom from a distance was equally fast delivered from the control room as compared to an operator located 1200 km away without compromising on map completeness. This demonstrates the feasibility of telerobotic interventions and stress the need for remote collaboration which is especially valuable when travel of patients and/or physician experts is restricted.

The recombinant isolation frequency was about 10?9recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7-fold higher at the 5-end of the S gene than in other areas of the genome. Thirty recombinants were plaque purified and characterized phenotypically and genetically. All recombinant viruses had a single crossover and had inherited the 5- and 3-halves of their genome from the enteric and respiratory parents, respectively. Recombinant viruses were classified into three groups, named 1 to 3, according to the location of the crossover. Group 1 recombinants had the crossover in the S gene, while in Groups 2 and 3 the crossovers were located in ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was studied. Recombinants of Group 1 had enteric and respiratory tropism, while Group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory, but not the enteric, tract. Viruses of both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both changes may be in principle responsible for the loss of enteric tropism but only the change in nucleotide 655 was specifically found in the respiratory isolates and most likely this single nucleotide change, which leads to a substitution in amino acid 219 of the S protein, was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in the closely related PUR-46 isolates. The available data indicate that in order to infect enteric tract cells with TGEV, two different domains of the S protein, mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively, are involved.

During the infection process, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a crucial role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, new variants of these spike proteins emerge as the virus passes through the host reservoir. This poses a major challenge for the design of a potent antibody against these spike proteins. Through structural bioinformatics analysis based on normal mode analysis (NMA) we identified a highly flexible region in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, starting from residue 475 up to residue 485. Structurally, S477 shows the highest rotational degrees of freedom among them. At the same time, S477 is the worlds most frequently mutated residue in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, using advanced MD simulations, we have investigated the role of S477 and its two frequent mutations (S477G and S477N) at the RBD during the binding to hACE2. We found that the amino acid exchanges S477G and S477N strengthen the binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike with the hACE2 receptor.","output":"Serine 477 plays a crucial role in the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human receptor ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) symptoms, including systemic inflammatory response and multi-system organ failure, are now affecting thousands of infected patients and causing widespread mortality. Coronavirus infection causes tissue damage, which triggers the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and subsequent eicosanoid and cytokine storms. While pro-inflammatory eicosanoids including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes are critical mediators of physiological processes such as inflammation, fever, allergy, and pain, their role in COVID-19 are poorly characterized. Arachidonic acid derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) could alleviate the systemic hyper-inflammatory response in COVID-19 infection by modulating ER stress and stimulating the resolution of inflammation. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors, which increase endogenous EET levels, exhibit potent anti-inflammatory activity and inhibit various pathologic processes in preclinical disease models including pulmonary fibrosis, thrombosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, targeting eicosanoids and sEH could be a novel therapeutic approach in combating COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the predominant role of eicosanoids in regulating the inflammatory cascade and propose the potential application of sEH inhibitors in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms. We also discuss the host-protective action of omega-3 fatty acid-derived epoxyeicosanoids and specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in regulating anti-inflammation and anti-viral response.

Rates of oseltamivir and antibiotic prescriptions were significantly different among the three test groups (chi-squared values of 167.6 [P < 0.0001] and 10.48 [P = 0.005], respectively), but there was no significant difference in antibiotic prescription rates between the non-influenza virus pathogen group and those who tested negative (chi-square value, 0; P = 1.0). Among adult outpatients, testing positive for influenza virus was associated with receiving fewer antibiotic prescriptions, but no such effect was seen for those who tested positive for a non-influenza virus.

However, the mechanisms of toxic action of ACO remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the cardiac effects of ACO and mesaconitine (MACO), a structurally related analog of ACO identified in Aconitum with undocumented cardiotoxicity in guinea pigs. We showed that intravenous administration of ACO or MACO (25 g/kg) to guinea pigs caused various types of arrhythmias in electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, including ventricular premature beats (VPB), atrioventricular blockade (AVB), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). MACO displayed more potent arrhythmogenic effect than ACO. We conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recording in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, and observed that treatment with ACO (0.3, 3 M) or MACO (0.1, 0.3 M) depolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP) and reduced the action potential amplitude (APA) and durations (APDs) in a concentration-dependent manner. The ACO- and MACO-induced AP remodeling was largely abolished by an INa blocker tetrodotoxin (2 M) and partly abolished by a specific Na+/K+ pump (NKP) blocker ouabain (0.1 M). Furthermore, we observed that treatment with ACO or MACO attenuated NKP current (INa/K) and increased peak INa by accelerating the sodium channel activation with the EC50 of 8.36  1.89 and 1.33  0.16 M, respectively. Incubation of ventricular myocytes with ACO or MACO concentration-dependently increased intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates strong arrhythmogenic effects of ACO and MACO resulted from increasing the peak INa via accelerating sodium channel activation and inhibiting the INa/K. These results may help to improve our understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms of ACO and MACO, and identify potential novel therapeutic targets for Aconitum poisoning.","output":"Inhibition of the INa/K and the activation of peak INa contribute to the arrhythmogenic effects of aconitine and mesaconitine in guinea pigs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: Public hospital(s).

With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. Objectives This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords COVID 19, SARS-CoV-2, and treatment. All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines. Discussion There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Glucocorticoids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. Conclusion There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.","output":"Pharmacotherapy in COVID-19; A narrative review for emergency providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine is utilized in the United States, but its acceptance has been limited In the environment of apandemic, the healthcare industry is forced to alter the delivery of care to contain the virus' spread Utilizingtelemedicine in small community settings may ensure continuity of care and deliver healthcare advice whilereducing the risk of exposure Program Goals: review the challenges, benets, and limitations of rapidlyimplementing telemedicine into one small Pediatric Allergy practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic Implementation resources included education via online webinars and online research Evaluation: Care wasdelivered by a physician and nurse practitioner via real-time audiovisual teleconference Platforms utilizedincluded Zoom and Doxy me Preparation included evaluating telemedicine platforms, staff training, andpatient education in the setting of quickly changing regulatory and nancial policies During the rst month oftelemedicine implementation, clinicians perceived several frustrations These included reviewing test results without parents possessing the test result copies Concerns of HIPAA privacy limited document sharing withfamilies Parents were also visualized writing their child's results which may have impaired their ability toabsorb information provided by the clinician It was also perceived that direct interaction with the pediatricpatient was decreased due to a lack of engagement with the child Many younger children were distracted bytheir home setting and did not stay focused on the conversation Adolescents did actively engage Despitethese limitations, within 2 weeks, the office successfully provided care for disorders including food allergy,allergic rhinitis, asthma, urticaria and atopic dermatitis Partial physical exams were conducted, includingassessments of patient appearance, quality of conversation, face/eyelid/skin, chest excursion & chest wallsymmetry, respiratory effort, mental status, and mood/affect Counseling, education and gross patientassessments were effectively accomplished with parents expressing satisfaction with remote care Limitations were noted in the setting of an acute asthma exacerbation These included restrictions in patient assessment,such as vital signs and auscultation of breath sounds Despite counseling and medication prescriptionprovided via telemedicine, the patient later sought emergency care via ED Discussion: rapid deployment wasachieved in a community small-office setting Successes included effective patient counseling and educationand delivery of patient care for non-emergent conditions These could be accomplished with the partialphysical exam available through audiovisual interface Limitations included decreased engagement of youngerchildren and the lack of document sharing, which can be addressed via other HIPAA-compliant technologyplatforms Asthma exacerbation was not effectively managed and illustrates the limitations of remotehealthcare in acute situations However, many patient encounters can be effectively managed with theassistance of telemedicine and may allow for maintaining healthcare delivery in the setting of an acutepandemic","output":"Implementation study: Challenges of rapid telemedicineimplementation into a small community pediatric allergy-asthma practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 in China hinged on severe restrictions to human movement starting 23 January 2020 in Wuhan and subsequently to other provinces.

MethodWe explored the relationship between the proportion of samples that were S-gene positive and the Rt of test-positive cases over time from the 23 February 2021 to the 25 May 2021. Effective reproduction numbers were estimated using the EpiNow2 R package independently for each local authority using two different estimates of the generation time. We then fit a range of regression models to estimate a multiplicative relationship between S-gene positivity and weekly mean Rt estimate. ResultsWe found evidence of an association between increased mean Rt estimates and the proportion of S-gene positives across all models evaluated with the magnitude of the effect increasing as model flexibility was decreased. Models that adjusted for either national level or NHS region level time-varying residuals were found to fit the data better, suggesting potential unexplained confounding. ConclusionsOur results indicated that even after adjusting for time-varying residuals between NHS regions, S-gene positivity was associated with an increase in the effective reproduction number of COVID-19. These findings were robust across a range of models and generation time assumptions, though the specific effect size was variable depending on the assumptions used.

This review describes technical options offered to properly run TGA, including a review of preanalytical and analytical items, performance, interpretation, and applications in physiology research and pharmacy.","output":"Thrombin generation assays are versatile tools in blood coagulation analysis: a review of technical features, and applications from research to laboratory routine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scale of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and its disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations has spurred unprecedented focus on and investment in social determinants of health (SDOH). Although the greater focus on social determinants is laudable and necessary, there is a tendency for health care organizations to implement SDOH programs at scale without rigorous evidence of effect, rather than targeting interventions to specific patients and assessing their impact. This broad, and sometimes blind, application of SDOH interventions can be costly and wasteful. We argue for rejecting the \\"more is better\\" mindset and specifically targeting patients who truly need and would substantially benefit from SDOH interventions.

Since no specific drugs have been made available yet and there is an imbalance between supply and demand for vaccines, early diagnosis and isolation are essential to control the outbreak. Current nucleic acid testing methods require high sample quality and laboratory conditions, which cannot meet flexible applications. Here, we report a laser-induced graphene field-effect transistor (LIG-FET) for detecting SARS-CoV-2. The FET was manufactured by different reduction degree LIG, with an oyster reef-like porous graphene channel to enrich the binding point between the virus protein and sensing area. After immobilizing specific antibodies in the channel, the FET can detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 15 min at a concentration of 1 pg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 ng/mL in human serum. In addition, the sensor shows great specificity to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Our sensors can realize fast production for COVID-19 rapid testing, as each LIG-FET can be fabricated by a laser platform in seconds. It is the first time that LIG has realized a virus sensing FET without any sample pretreatment or labeling, which paves the way for low-cost and rapid detection of COVID-19.","output":"Ultrasensitive Detection of COVID-19 Causative Virus (SARS-CoV-2) Spike Protein Using Laser Induced Graphene Field-Effect Transistor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interaction of heat shock proteins (HSP) with cellular membranes has been an enigmatic process, initially observed by morphological studies, inferred during the purification of HSP70s, and confirmed after the detection of these proteins on the surface of cancer cells and their insertion into artificial lipid bilayers. Today, the association of several HSP with lipid membranes is well established. However, the mechanisms for membrane insertion have been elusive. There is conclusive evidence indicating that HSP70s have a great selectivity for negatively charged phospholipids, whereas other HSP have a broader spectrum of lipid specificity. HSP70 also oligomerizes upon membrane insertion, forming ion conductance channels. The functional role of HSP70 lipid interactions appears related to membrane stabilization that may play a role during cell membrane biogenesis. They could also play a role as membrane chaperones as well as during endocytosis, microautophagy, and signal transduction. Moreover, HSP membrane association is a key component in the extracellular export of these proteins. The presence of HSP70 on the surface of cancer cells and its interaction with lysosome membranes have been envisioned as potential therapeutic targets. Thus, the biology and function of HSP membrane association are reaching a new level of excitement.

One potential application of RADTs is to facilitate gatherings of individuals, through testing of attendees at the point of, or immediately prior to entry at a venue. Understanding the baseline risk in the tested population is of particular importance when evaluating the utility of applying diagnostic tests for screening purposes. We used incidence data to estimate the prevalence of infectious individuals in the community at a particular time point and simulated mass gatherings by sampling from a series of age cohorts. Nine different illustrative scenarios were simulated, small (n=100), medium (n=1000) and large (n=10,000) gatherings each with 3 possible age constructs: mostly younger, mostly older or a gathering with equal numbers from each age cohort. For each scenario, we estimated the prevalence of infectious attendees, then simulated the likely number of positive and negative test results, the proportion of cases detected and the corresponding positive and negative predictive values, and the cost per case identified. Our findings suggest that for each detected individual on a given day, there are likely to be 13.8 additional infectious individuals also present in the community. Prevalence of infectious individuals at events was highest with mostly younger attendees (1.00%), followed by homogenous age gatherings (0.55%) and lowest with mostly older events (0.26%). For small events (100 attendees) the expected number of infectious attendees was less than 1 across all age constructs of attendees. For large events (10,000 attendees) the expected number of infectious attendees ranged from 26 (95% confidence intervals 12 to 45) for mostly older events, to almost 100 (95% confidence intervals 46 to 174) infectious attendees for mostly younger attendees.

Effective biosurveillance systems can primarily support appropriate responses to biological threats and consequently save human lives. Nevertheless, biosurveillance systems are costly to implement and hard to operate. Furthermore, they rely on static infrastructures that might not cope with the evolving dynamics of the monitored environment. In this paper, we present a reorganizing biosurveillance framework for the detection and localization of biological threats with fog and mobile edge computing support. In the proposed framework, a hierarchy of fog nodes are responsible for aggregating monitoring data within their regions and detecting potential threats. Although fog nodes are deployed on a fixed base station infrastructure, the framework provides an innovative technique for reorganizing the monitored environment structure to adapt to the evolving environmental conditions and to overcome the limitations of the static base station infrastructure. Evaluation results illustrate the ability of the framework to localize biological threats and detect infected areas.

This change may particularly impact medical students, whose education is heavily influenced by clinical learning experiences. Accordingly, we investigated medical students perceptions about positive and negative aspects of online medical education in Japan and overseas during the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: In-depth online interviews were conducted among 13 Japanese medical students and five medical students from Slovakia, Norway, and Hungary. Interviews were conducted from 23rd September to 3rd October 2020 using the snowball sampling method. Questions were focused on five main areas: Q1 the type of online education; Q2 advantages and disadvantages of online education; Q3 any changes in the relationship with teachers, friends, and family; Q4 any opinions about further improvements in online education; and Q5 any needs for affiliation with a particular university. Then thematic analysis was conducted. (3) Results: The results of the thematic analysis revealed the following four themes that represent the positive and negative aspects of online medical education; Theme 1: Timesaving and Flexibility; Theme 2: Technical problems and lack of digital skills; Theme 3: Unstandardized teaching skills; Theme 4: Lack of experience beyond medical school lectures. (4) Conclusions: While online education was found useful in terms of saving time and creating a flexible learning environment, many important drawbacks were noted such as internet and computer problems and unstandardized teaching skills, and lack of quality assurance.

For many years prior to his Sars-Cov2 infection he suffered from very frequent migraine attacks and for control of headache he had been taking triptans almost daily. In the 16-month period before outbreak of COVID-19 on 98% of the days triptans were taken with only a 21-day prednisolone-supported triptan holiday, which, however, had no longer-lasting consequences on migraine frequency. Upon Sars-Cov2 infection, the patient developed only mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and headache.

Medical facilities around the world were not prepared for the enormous challenges posed by the growing number of patients each day, the shortage of personal protective equipment, and insufficient numbers of medical staff. Governments have tried to counteract the impact of the pandemic, but the measures taken have not always been sufficient to maintain access to and quality of health services at the same level as before the pandemic. The disruption of health services has resulted in more and more research reports from different parts of the world on the accessibility of health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: This review article presents 21 selected scientific studies on access to health services in different regions of the world. Articles were found in PubMed, GoogleScholar, Medline, and ScienceDirect databases, then grouped, and significant data were extracted from each article. The results were summarized in a table. Results: The range of limited health services included a variety of specialties, including primary care, psychiatry, orthopedics, cardiology, neurosurgery, and more. Methods used in the studies were based on retrospective analysis or on the subjective assessment of patients in the form of a questionnaire or interview. Most authors claimed a decrease in accessibility to health services during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period, including a decrease in planned surgeries, doctor appointments, patient admission to hospital or ER, and access to medicines. Additionally, some authors observed an increase in the mortality rate. One of the few medical services that have expanded rapidly during the pandemic was online appointments. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has most certainly affected the accessibility of health services worldwide.

Telemedicine was used on the first level of triage to reduce contacts between healthcare workers and patients. Weekly coordination between EDCs was supported by real\\\\time data acquisition on the number of patient visits, prescribed medicine, the number and type of dental procedures, and the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: In EDCs, 27,468 patients were serviced, on average 235 patients per day/million people. The care was provided by 4798 man days of dental health care workers. Except for the first week, treatment and triage visits showed a slight increase. The number of incisions was nearly constant, while the number of extractions increased. A nearly threefold increase was found for emergency endodontic treatments (EET). The number of antibiotic prescriptions demonstrated an increasing trend.

There is an imperative need, for policy makers at all levels, to consider socioeconomic and racial and ethnic disparities in pandemic planning. Cross-sectional analysis from COVID Boston University's Center for Antiracist Research COVID Racial Data Tracker was performed to evaluate the racial and ethnic distribution of COVID-19 outcomes relative to representation in the United States. Representation quotients (RQs) were calculated to assess for disparity using state-level data from the American Community Survey (ACS). We found that on a national level, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and Black people had RQs > 1, indicating that these groups are over-represented in COVID-19 incidence. Dramatic racial and ethnic variances in state-level incidence and mortality RQs were also observed. This study investigates pandemic disparities and examines some factors which inform the social determination of health. These findings are key for developing effective public policy and allocating resources to effectively decrease health disparities.

To define the dynamics and characteristics of the antibody repertoire following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the mRNA transcripts of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) repertoires of 24 peripheral blood samples collected between 3 and 111 days after symptom onset from 10 COVID-19 patients. Massive clonal expansion of naive B cells with limited somatic hypermutation (SHM) was observed in the second week after symptom onset. The proportion of low-SHM IgG clones strongly correlated with spike-specific IgG antibody titers, highlighting the significant activation of naive B cells in response to a novel virus infection. The antibody isotype switching landscape showed a transient IgA surge in the first week after symptom onset, followed by a sustained IgG elevation that lasted for at least 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited poly-germ line reactive antibody responses. Interestingly, 17 different IGHV germ line genes recombined with IGHJ6 showed significant clonal expansion. By comparing the IgH repertoires that we sequenced with the 774 reported SARS-CoV-2Creactive monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 13 shared spike-specific IgH clusters were found. These shared spike-specific IgH clusters are derived from the same lineage of several recently published neutralizing MAbs, including CC12.1, CC12.3, C102, REGN10977, and 4A8. Furthermore, identical spike-specific IgH sequences were found in different COVID-19 patients, suggesting a highly convergent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis based on sequencing antibody repertoires from different individuals revealed key signatures of the systemic B cell response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Although the canonical delineation of serum antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been well established, the dynamics of antibody repertoire at the mRNA transcriptional level has not been well understood, especially the correlation between serum antibody titers and the antibody mRNA transcripts.

For the effects of eight therapies on mortality and mechanical ventilation, we performed meta-analyses including preprints and excluding preprints at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the first trial addressing the therapy became available either as a preprint or publication (120 meta-analyses in total). ResultsWe included 356 trials, 101 of which are only available as preprints, 181 as journal publications, and 74 as preprints first and subsequently published in journals. Half of all preprints remain unpublished at six months and a third at one year. There were few important differences in key methods and results between trial preprints and their subsequent published reports. We identified four retracted trials, three of which were published in peer-reviewed journals. With two exceptions (2/60; 3.3%), point estimates were consistent between meta-analyses including versus excluding preprints as to whether they indicated benefit, no appreciable effect, or harm. There were nine comparisons (9/60; 15%) for which the rating of the certainty of evidence differed when preprints were included versus excluded, for four of these comparisons the certainty of evidence including preprints was higher and for five of these comparisons the certainty of evidence including preprints was lower. LimitationsThe generalizability of our results is limited to COVID-19. Preprints that are subsequently published in journals may be the most rigorous and may not represent all trial preprints. ConclusionWe found no compelling evidence that preprints provide less trustworthy results than published papers. We show that preprints remain the only source of findings of many trials for several months, a length of time that is unacceptable in a health emergency.

In Healthcare workers the strongest contributor to vaccine hesitancy was having a Moderate Confidence (OR: 0.323, p=0.042, 95% CI: 0.109-0.958) in the vaccine followed by Moderate Convenience (OR: 0.304, p=0.049, 95% CI: 0.093-0.993) for vaccination Conclusion: Campaigning and communication strategies to reaffirm confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and educating the general population about the vaccine could lead to increased perception of vaccine safety and effectiveness thereby restoring confidence in vaccine and decreasing vaccine hesitancy. Likewise, working to increase vaccine convenience and decreasing complacency towards the COVID-19 vaccine would translate into high vaccine uptake.","output":"Understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan: The paradigm of Confidence, Convenience and Complacency; A Cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The\\"New York State on Pause\\"executive order came into effect on March 22 with the goal of ensuring adequate social distancing to alleviate the spread of COVID-19. Pause will remain effective in New York City in some form until early June. We use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of testing capacity and social distancing measures on the evolution of the pandemic in the\\"post-Pause\\"period in the City. We find that testing capacity must increase dramatically if it is to counterbalance even relatively small relaxations in social distancing measures in the immediate post-Pause period. In particular, if the City performs 20,000 tests per day and relaxes the social distancing measures to the pre-Pause norms, then the total number of deaths by the end of September can reach 250,000. By keeping the social distancing measures to somewhere halfway between the pre- and in-Pause norms and performing 100,000 tests per day, the total number of deaths by the end of September can be kept at around 27,000. Going back to the pre-Pause social distancing norms quickly must be accompanied by an exorbitant testing capacity, if one is to suppress excessive deaths. If the City is to go back to the\\"pre-Pause\\"social distancing norms in the immediate post-Pause period and keep the total number of deaths by the end of September at around 35,000, then it should be performing 500,000 tests per day.

Among the multiple factors possibly involved, a role for air pollution has also been hypothesized. This nationwide observational study demonstrated the significant positive relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and PM2.5 and NO(2) levels in Italy, both considering the period 2016C2020 and the months of the epidemic, through univariate regression models, after logarithmic transformation of the variables, as the data were not normally distributed. That relationship was confirmed by a multivariate analysis showing the combined effect of the two pollutants, adjusted for the old-age index and population density. An increase in PM2.5 and NO(2) concentrations by one unit (1 g/m(3)) corresponded to an increase in incidence rates of 1.56 and 1.24  10(4) people, respectively, taking into account the average levels of air pollutants in the period 2016C2020, and 2.79 and 1.24  10(4) people during MarchCMay 2020.

Methods: We measured SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral and cellular immune responses in people with and without HIV recovering from COVID-19 (n=39 and n=43, respectively) using binding antibody, surrogate virus neutralization, intracellular cytokine staining, and inflammatory marker assays. We identified individuals experiencing symptomatic post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) and evaluated immunologic parameters. We used linear regression and generalized linear models to examine differences by HIV status in the magnitude of inflammatory and virus-specific antibody and T cell responses, as well as differences in the prevalence of PASC. Results: Among PWH, we found broadly similar SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell immune responses as compared with a well-matched group of HIV-negative individuals. PWH had 70% lower relative levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific memory CD8+ T cells (p=0.007) and 53% higher relative levels of PD-1+ SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T cells (p=0.007). Higher CD4/CD8 ratio was associated with lower PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells (0.34-fold effect, p=0.02). HIV status was strongly associated with PASC (odds ratio 4.01, p=0.008), and the proportion of PD-1+ CD4+ T cells and levels of certain inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IP-10) were associated with persistent symptoms. Conclusions: We identified potentially important differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that might have implications for long-term immunity conferred by natural infection. HIV status strongly predicted the presence of PASC.

The proper treatment methods to overcome this contagious disease are still limited. The main protease enzyme (M(pro), also called 3CL(pro)) is essential for viral replication and has been considered as one of the potent drug targets for treating COVID-19. In this study, virtual screening was performed to find out the molecular interactions between 36 natural compounds derived from sesame and the M(pro) of COVID-19. Four natural metabolites, namely, sesamin, sesaminol, sesamolin, and sesamolinol have been ranked as the top interacting molecules to M(pro) based on the affinity of molecular docking. Moreover, stability of these four sesame-specific natural compounds has also been evaluated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 200 nanoseconds. The molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations revealed that these compounds have stable and favorable energies, causing strong binding with M(pro). These screened natural metabolites also meet the essential conditions for drug likeness such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties as well as Lipinskis rule of five.

The drugs {acyclovir (1) and ganciclovir (2)}, ionic liquids (A, B, and C), and their combinations (1\\\\A, 1\\\\B, 1\\\\C, 2\\\\A, 2\\\\B, and 2\\\\C) were studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations via determining the different energies. These values are important to understand the formation of 1\\\\A, 1\\\\B, 1\\\\C, 2\\\\A, 2\\\\B, and 2\\\\C and are found to negative. Complexes formed by acyclovir with ILs (B and C) are more favorable due to less value of change in free energy. Further, 1 interacts with IL(C) and 2 interacts well with IL(A), and it is based on the calculated dipole moment of 1\\\\C and 2\\\\A, as 17.4 and 27.6, respectively.

It takes insight and courage to question traditional approaches and paradigms: why are psychiatric training programs done the way that they are? Reverse engineering involves taking something apart and analysing its workings to figure out how it does what it does and how it can be improved. In education, reverse engineering implies one determines learning outcomes upfront and then works back from them. Applied to postgraduate psychiatric training, it requires us to determine the basic principles or core concepts resulting in the successful formation of a well-rounded psychiatrist. In times of crisis there usually is more leeway to challenge the status-quo C hence the saying never waste a good crisis. Indeed, if the COVID-19 crisis has taught us anything, it is that education should be meeting learners where their attention is at, and that any healthcare organisation can be transformed within weeks when given the right incentives.

Currently available murine models are limited because wound contraction introduces bias into wound surface area measurements. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate utility of a human-mouse xenograft model for studying human wound healing. Normal human skin was harvested from elective abdominoplasty surgery, xenografted onto athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, and allowed to engraft for 3 months. The graft was then wounded using a 2-mm punch biopsy. Wounds were harvested on sequential days to allow tissue-based markers of wound healing to be followed sequentially. On the day of wound harvest, mice were injected with XenoLight RediJect cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) probe and imaged according to package instructions. Immunohistochemistry confirms that this human-mouse xenograft model is effective for studying human wound healing in vivo. Additionally, in vivo fluorescent imaging for inducible COX-2 demonstrated upregulation from baseline to day 4 (P = 003) with return to baseline levels by day 10, paralleling the reepithelialisation of the wound.

As of September 2019, 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases with 851 associated deaths have occurred with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, according to the World Health Organization. An imported case of MERS occurred in South Korea in 2015, stimulating a multi-month outbreak. Several distinguishing factors emerge upon epidemiological and sociological analysis of the two outbreaks including public awareness of the MERS outbreak, and transmission and synchronization of governing healthcare bodies. South Korea implemented a stringent healthcare model that protected patients and healthcare workers alike through prevention and high levels of public information. In addition, many details about MERS-CoV virology, transmission, pathological progression, and even the reservoir, remain unknown. This paper aims to delineate the key differences between the two regional outbreaks from both a healthcare and personal perspective including differing hospital practices, information and public knowledge, cultural practices, and reservoirs, among others.

DESIGN: A hospital-based clinical study of plasma glucose of COVID-19 patients conducted from May 15th to June 30th, 2020 after ethical approval. MEASUREMENTS: Random blood samples at admission were collected for plasma glucose, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) after written informed consent. Plasma glucose was analyzed by automated analyzer, IL-6 by chemiluminescent immunoassay and hsCRP by immune-turbidimetric assay. RESULTS: A total of 386 patients studied (female 39.6%); 11.1% had severe disease and 4.1% expired. There were 67 (17.4%) patients with known diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with history of DM had three times higher mortality (6/66, 9%) than those without DM (10/319, 3.1%). Patients with moderate and severe disease according to ICMR and WHO grading had higher plasma glucose than those with asymptomatic or mild disease (p<0.0001). Plasma glucose levels at admission were significantly higher in non-survivors when compared to those who survived (297117 vs. 13173; p<0.0001).

It possesses a wide spectrum of biological activities, thus suggesting a role in disease prevention and health promotion. The present review aimed to uncover the bone-sparing effects of quercetin and its mechanism of action. Animal studies have found that the action of quercetin on bone is largely protective, with a small number of studies reporting negative outcomes. Quercetin was shown to inhibit RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, osteoblast apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory response while promoting osteogenesis, angiogenesis, antioxidant expression, adipocyte apoptosis and osteoclast apoptosis. The possible underlying mechanisms involved are regulation of Wnt, NF-B, Nrf2, SMAD-dependent, and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. On the other hand, quercetin was shown to exert complex and competing actions on the MAPK signalling pathway to orchestrate bone metabolism, resulting in both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on bone in parallel. The overall interaction is believed to result in a positive effect on bone. Considering the important contributions of quercetin in regulating bone homeostasis, it may be considered an economical and promising agent for improving bone health.

Due to pandemic protocols in the USA, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) regulations became more flexible, permitting our community-based nonprofit organization to transition its low-threshold MAT clinic to an audio-only telehealth model of care in 2020. Lessons learned have the potential to improve MAT delivery to people with OUD. CASE PRESENTATION: This case study describes our transition from a low-threshold community-based in-person MAT clinic to an audio-only telehealth model. We extracted data from electronic health records to describe patient characteristics and to calculate treatment retention rates. Patients were predominantly male (74.4%) and black (90.6%). The mean age was 53 years old with more than half of the clients aged 55 or older. Less than half (42.3%) of the patients lived in stable housing. Patients commonly had self-reported comorbid conditions such as hypertension (35.4%), hepatitis C (23.5%), diabetes (11.9%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (7.2%). A majority of patients (68.6%) reported engagement with behavioral health care. We measure the success of our intervention relative to published retention rates, both overall as well as for in-person and telehealth care. In-person retention rates at 90- and 180-days were substantially higher than telehealth retention rates (93.9% vs 68.4% and 91.5% vs 51.9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low-threshold medication-assisted treatment in the care of people with opioid use disorder is essential to increasing treatment access and continuity. We found that an audio-only telehealth model was viable. Although we had decreased retention rates following the transition to an audio-only telehealth model, our rates remained excellent compared to published values for in-person MAT care.
