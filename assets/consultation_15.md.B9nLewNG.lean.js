However, the process of internationalisation (IP) theory treats an individual decision-maker as a black box. Emotions are largely ignored by international business (IB) researchers. This study offers conceptual thoughts on the role of fear of failure in the process of internationalisation. It argues that managers experience this emotion in making internationalisation decisions for a firm, which is an area of study that requires further understanding. Following the content analysis method in the literature review and a theory-based adaptation approach to complete the conceptualisation, this manuscript joins the scholarly conversations on connecting the IP model to people and emotion and internationalisation. Focussing on fear of failure as a new perspective, this manuscript contributes to IB literature by suggesting new avenues in understanding decision-making about international activities by embracing psychological insights. It also contributes to IB practitioners by offering implications for understanding ones emotional state and its effect on decision-making about internationalising ventures.","output":"Emotion and International Business: Theorising Fear of Failure in the Internationalisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020 forced many schools to switch to emergency virtual instruction. This situation provided an opportunity to explore the effectiveness of online learning from studentsperspectives. To discover best practices for online learning, 584 STEM students at California State Polytechnic University Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) were surveyed about their Spring and Fall 2020 experiences. Some of the obstacles students faced were adapting to a new lifestyle, feeling disconnected, managing schedule and workload, and overcoming distractions. Despite difficulties, 61% of students benefited from the flexibility, convenience, and increased productivity. The time students normally spent commuting to and parking on campus was instead spent getting more sleep, studying, working extra hours, spending time with family, and practicing self-care. Another major benefit was the increased accessibility to course materials posted online. Major themes from studentsresponses were belonging, organization and transparency, and the need for real-world applications.

Therefore, it is important to measure how far apart the field of cell biology and medicine are. Our approach to estimating the distance between these fields was to compare their vocabularies and to quantify the difference in word repertoire. We compared the vocabulary of the title and abstract of articles available in PubMed in two selected high-impact journals in each field: cell biology, medicine, and translational science. Although each journal has its own editorial policy, we showed that within each field there is a small vocabulary difference between the two journals. We developed a word similarity index that can measure how much journals share a common vocabulary. We found a high similarity index between each cell biology (91%), medical (71-74%), and translational journal (65%). In contrast, the comparison between medicine and biology journals produced low correlation values (22-36%), suggesting that their vocabularies are quite dissimilar. Translational medicine journals had medium similarity values when compared to cell biology journals (52-70%) and medicine journals (27-59%). This approach was also performed in 10-year periods to evaluate the evolution of each field. Using the onomics strategy presented here, we observed that differences in vocabulary of basic science and medicine have been increasing over time. Since translational medicine has an intermediate vocabulary, we confirmed that translational medicine is an efficient approach to bridge this gap.","output":"Do medicine and cell biology talk to each other?

Clonal Mast Cells Activation Disorders (cMCADs) such as mastocytosis and clonal mast cells activation syndrome are characterized by an abnormal mast cells accumulation and/or activation. No data have been published on the anti-viral immune response of patients with cMCADs. The aims of the study were to collected, in a comprehensive way, outcomes of cMCADs patients who experienced a biologically-proven COVID-19 and to characterize both anti-endemic coronaviruses and specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in these patients. Clinical follow-up and outcome data were collected prospectively for one year within the French rare disease network CEREMAST encompassing patients from all over the country. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-endemic coronaviruses specific T-cells were assessed with an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (EliSpot) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response with dosage of circulating levels of specific IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies. Overall, 32 cMCADs patients were identified. None of them required non-invasive or mechanical ventilation; two patients were hospitalized to receive oxygen and steroid therapy. In 21 patients, a characterization of the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response has been performed. A majority of patients showed a high proportion of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon (IFN)-{gamma} producing T-cells and high levels of anti-Spike IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity. In addition, no defects in anti-endemic coronaviruses responses were found in patients with cMCADs compared to non-cMCADs controls. Patients with cMCADs frequently showed a spontaneous IFN-{gamma} T-cell production in absence of any stimulation that correlated with circulating basal tryptase levels, a marker of mast cells burden. These findings underscore that patients with cMCADs might be not at risk of severe COVID-19 and the spontaneous IFN-{gamma} production might explain this observation. Author SummaryMast cells are immune cells involved in many biological processes including the anti-microbial response. However, previous studies suggest that mast cells may have a detrimental role in the response against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, responsible for COVID-19. When a mutation occurs in mast cells, it can lead to a group of diseases called clonal mast cells activation disorders (cMCADs), characterized by deregulated activation of these cells. Hence, patients with cMCADs might be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than general population. We therefore conducted a 1-year study in France to collect data from all cMCADs patients included in the CEREMAST rare disease French network and who experienced COVID-19. Interestingly, we did not find any severe COVID-19 (i.e. requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation) in spite of well-known risk factors for severe COVID-19 in a part of cMCADs patients. We then have studied the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and other endemic coronaviruses in these patients. We did not observe any abnormalities in the immune response either at the level of T and B lymphocytes. These findings underscore that these patients might not be at risk of severe COVID-19 as one might have feared.","output":"Absence of severe COVID-19 in patients with clonal mast cells activation disorders: effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U.S.CChina rivalry has become a guiding paradigm of international relation that can only be understood in its multidimensionality.

Participants treated in AHI stage 1 had lower Env-specific Ab levels and ADCC activity on ART than did those treated later. Importantly, participants who initiated ART after peak viremia in AHI developed elevated cross-clade ADCC responses that were detectable 1 year after ART initiation, even though clinically undetectable viremia was reached by 24 weeks. These data suggest that there is more germinal center (GC) activity in the later stages of AHI and that Ab development continues in the absence of detectable viremia during the first year of suppressive ART. The development of therapeutic interventions that can enhance earlier development of GCs in AHI and Abs after ART initiation could provide important protection against the viral reservoir that is seeded in individuals treated early in the disease.","output":"Anti-HIV antibody development up to 1 year after antiretroviral therapy initiation in acute HIV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores changes to school food standards from 2010, free school meal provision during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic across the UK and potential implications for children's diets.

School food is an important part of the UK's health agenda and commitment to improving children's diets. Each UK nation has food\\\\based standards implemented, however, only Scotland and Wales also have nutrient\\\\based standards. School food standards in each nation have been updated in the last decade.

There is a lack of consistent monitoring of school food across the UK nations, and a lack of reporting compliance to the standards. Each nation differed in its response and management of free school meals during COVID\\\\related school closures. Further, there are issues surrounding the monitoring of the methods to provide free school meal support during school closures.

However, most cancers have a modest mutational burden that is insufficient to generate responses using neoantigen-based therapies2,3. Neuroblastoma is a paediatric cancer that harbours few mutations and is instead driven by epigenetically deregulated transcriptional networks4. Here we show that the neuroblastoma immunopeptidome is enriched with peptides derived from proteins that are essential for tumourigenesis and focus on targeting the unmutated peptide QYNPIRTTF, discovered on HLA-A*24:02, which is derived from the neuroblastoma dependency gene and master transcriptional regulator PHOX2B. To target QYNPIRTTF, we developed peptide-centric chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) using a counter-panning strategy with predicted potentially cross-reactive peptides. We further hypothesized that peptide-centric CARs could recognize peptides on additional HLA allotypes when presented in a similar manner. Informed by computational modelling, we showed that PHOX2B peptide-centric CARs also recognize QYNPIRTTF presented by HLA-A*23:01 and the highly divergent HLA-B*14:02. Finally, we demonstrated potent and specific killing of neuroblastoma cells expressing these HLAs in vitro and complete tumour regression in mice.

METHODS: Employees at a private pathology laboratory in South Africa were invited to participate in a nationwide cross-sectional study. T-cell proliferation to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N)-proteins and spike (S)-proteins was measured by flow cytometry and compared between participants. RESULTS: Based on classification according to SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results, a total of 81% (42/52) of positive participants demonstrated T-cell proliferation to SARS-CoV-2 N-proteins or S-proteins (95% CI 67.5% to 90.4%), while 62% (68/110) of negative participants also had detectable T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins (95% CI 52.1% to 70.9%). When classified according to SARS-CoV-2 serology results, 92.6% (50/54) of positive participants demonstrated T-cell proliferation to SARS-CoV-2 proteins (95% CI 82.1 to 97,9 %), while 56% (60/108) of negative participants demonstrated T-cell proliferation (95% CI 45.7% to 65.1%).

However, there is a dearth of literature describing the pertinent ancillary procedures required for craniomaxillofacial research. With this in mind, our objective was to evaluate all necessary procedures required for perioperative management and animal safety related to experimental craniomaxillofacial surgical procedures such as orthotopic, maxillofacial transplantation. METHODS Miniature swine (n = 9) were used to investigate perioperative airway management, methods for providing nutrition, and long-dwelling intravenous access. Flap perfusion using near-infrared laser angiography and facial nerve assessment with electromyoneurography were explored. RESULTS Bivona tracheostomy was deemed appropriate versus Shiley because soft, wire-reinforced tubing reduced the incidence of tracheal necrosis. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, as opposed to esophagostomy, provided a reliable route for postoperative feeding. Femoral venous access with dorsal tunneling proved to be an ideal option being far from pertinent neck vessels. Laser angiography was beneficial for real-time evaluation of graft perfusion. Facial electromyoneurography techniques for tracing capture were found most optimal using percutaneous leads near the oral commissure.Experience shows that ancillary procedures are critical, and malpositioning of devices may lead to irreversible sequelae with premature animal death. CONCLUSIONS Face-jaw-teeth transplantation in swine is a complicated procedure that demands special attention to airway, feeding, and intravascular access. It is critical that each ancillary procedure be performed by a dedicated team familiar with relevant anatomy and protocol. Emphasis should be placed on secure skin-level fixation for all tube/lines to minimize risk for dislodgement.

We assessed whether the reduction in pedestrian deaths was proportional to a one-to-one matching presumed in statistics correlating mobility with fatality. The primary analysis examined New York (largest city in US), and the validation analysis examined Toronto (largest city in Canada). We identified pedestrian activity in each location from the Apple Mobility database, normalized to the baseline in January 2020. We calculated monthly pedestrian deaths from the Vision Zero database in each city with baseline data from 3 prior years. We found a large initial reduction in pedestrian deaths during the lockdown in New York that was transient and not statistically significant during the summer and autumn despite sustained reductions in pedestrian activity.

Together, these data suggest the substantial reductions in pedestrian activity during the COVID pandemic have no simple correlation with pedestrian fatality counts in the same locations.

Despite extensive supervision literature, including literature reviews, the processes through which supervision training interventions produce their effects, for whom and under what circumstances is not clearly delineated. The purpose of this study is to explain the effect of contextual factors on the underpinning mechanisms of supervision training outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We propose to examine supervision training interventions across the health and human services workforce using realist methods. Pawson's five stages for undertaking a realist synthesis will be followed: (1) clarifying the scope of the review; (2) determining the search strategy; (3) study selection; (4) extracting data and (5) synthesising the evidence and drawing conclusions. Extracted data will include study characteristics, characteristics of participant cohort, intervention type, contextual factors, underlying mechanisms and supervision training outcomes. Patterns in context-mechanism-outcome configurations will be identified. Initial programme theories will be developed based on a comprehensive search of the literature, which will include key terms relating to supervision and training. The search strategy will involve: (1) electronic database searching using Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Social Services Abstracts, Educational Resources Information Center, PsycINFO and Australian Public Affairs Information Service and (2) hand and citation searching. We will also contact authors where necessary and discuss identified literature among the project team with extensive expertise in supervision training. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The realist synthesis will propose an evidence-informed theory of supervision training interventions (ie, what interventions work for whom and why). The findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presentations and through discussions with relevant organisations and stakeholders. The research will be used by educators to develop evidenced-based supervision training interventions. It will also help workplace supervisors to better understand what types of supervision training might work most optimally for them and their colleagues. Other researchers could use the synthesis findings to guide future supervision research.

However, FYM&S may contain high concentrations of pathogens, and complete inactivation through the AD process is unlikely. Thus, following land application of digestate, pathogens may contaminate a range of environmental media posing a potential threat to public health. The present study aimed to combine primary laboratory data with literature-based secondary data to develop an Excel-based exposure assessment model (ADRISK) using a gamma generalised linear model to predict the final microorganism count in the digestate. This research examines the behaviour of a suite of pathogens (Cryptosporidium parvum, norovirus, Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium spp., and pathogenic Escherichia coli) and indicators (total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci) during mesophilic anaerobic digestion (M-AD) at 37 C, pre/post-AD pasteurisation, and after a period of storage (with/without lime) for different feedstock proportions (slurry:food waste: 0:1, 1:3, 2:1, and 3:1). ADRISK tool simulations of faecal indicator bacteria levels across all scenarios show that the digestate can meet the EU standard without pasteurisation if the AD runs at 37 C or a higher temperature with a higher C:N ratio (recipe 3) and a hydraulic retention time  7 days. The storage of digestate also reduced levels of microorganisms in the digestate. The Irish pasteurisation process (60 C for 4 days), although more energy-intensive, is more effective than the EU pasteurisation (70 C for 1 h) specification. Pre-AD pasteurisation was more effective for C. parvum, norovirus, Mycobacterium thermoresistibile. However, post-AD literature-based pasteurisation is most likely to assure the safety of the digestate. The information generated from this model can inform policy-makers regarding the optimal M-AD process parameters necessary to maximise the inactivation of microorganisms, ensuring adverse environmental impact is minimised, and public health is protected.","output":"Evaluation of pathogen concentration in anaerobic digestate using a predictive modelling approach (ADRISK)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the impact of the number of coronavirus cases on regime-switching in stock return volatility.

2020. The Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia acts to moderate the spread of COVID-19 through the enacted measures. Furthermore, massive industrial, agricultural activities and human encroachment were significantly reduced following the MCO guidelines. In this study, first, a reconnaissance survey was carried out on the effects of MCO on the health conditions of two urban rivers (i.e., Rivers of Klang and Penang) in Malaysia. Secondly, the effect of MCO lockdown on the water quality index (WQI) of a lake (Putrajaya Lake) in Malaysia is considered in this study. Finally, four machine learning algorithms have been investigated to predict WQI and the class in Putrajaya Lake. The main observations based on the analysis showed that noticeable enhancements of varying degrees in the WQI had occurred in the two investigated rivers. With regard to Putrajaya Lake, there is a significant increase in the WQI Class I, from 24% in February 2020 to 94% during the MCO month of March 2020. For WQI prediction, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) outperformed other models in predicting the changes in the index with a high level of accuracy. For sensitivity analysis results, it is shown that NH3-N and COD play vital rule and contributing significantly to predicting the class of WQI, followed by BOD, while the remaining three parameters (i.e. pH, DO, and TSS) exhibit a low level of importance.","output":"Surface water quality status and prediction during movement control operation order under COVID-19 pandemic: Case studies in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and rapidly spread across the world. In order to counter this epidemic, several countries put in place different restrictive measures, such as the school's closure and a total lockdown. However, as the knowledge on the disease progresses, clinical evidence showed that children mainly have asymptomatic or mild disease and it has been suggested that they are also less likely to spread the virus. Moreover, the lockdown and the school closure could have negative consequences on children, affecting their social life, their education and their mental health. As many countries have already entered or are planning a phase of gradual lifting of the containment measures of social distancing, it seems plausible that the re-opening of nursery schools and primary schools could be considered a policy to be implemented at an early stage of recovery efforts, putting in place measures to do it safely, such as the maintenance of social distance, the reorganisation of classes into smaller groups, the provision of adequate sanitization of spaces, furniture and toys, the prompt identification of cases in the school environment and their tracing. Therefore, policy makers have the task of balancing pros and cons of the school re-opening strategy, taking into account psychological, educational and social consequences for children and their families.

In particular, COVID-19 has led to changes in cancer treatment for patients (pts) infected with COVID, which may have long-term implications for both COVID and cancer-related outcomes. In this retrospective analysis, we describe changes in cancer management over time for cancer pts diagnosed with COVID-19 at two academic institutions in Northern California. Methods: Adult and pediatric pts diagnosed with COVID19 receiving active cancer management, defined as therapy/surgery/diagnostics within 3 weeks of COVID diagnosis, were identified through the EMR. Patients whose care was affected by COVID-19 were identified and analyzed for significant intra-group differences with regards to management type, treatment intent, and the time of COVID-19 diagnosis ('early' was defined as March to June 2020 and 'late' as July 2020 to January 2021). The duration and characteristics of such changes were compared across subgroups. Chi-squared test was used to compare the incidence of delays between subgroups. Results: Among 134 COVID-positive pts on active cancer management, 83 (62%) had significant changes in management that consisted primarily of treatment delays. More delays were identified in patients treated with curative intent earlier in the course of the pandemic compared to later (OR 4.1, p=0.022). This difference was not seen among pts treated with palliative intent. In addition, pts on oral (PO) therapy were significantly less likely to have treatment changes than those on IV/IM therapy (OR 0.32, p=0.005). This difference was driven by a decrease in management changes for those on PO therapy in the later time period (OR 0.27, p=0.026). Pts diagnosed later were more likely to have delays due to clinical reasons rather than institutional policy (OR 6.2, P&lt;.005). The median delay in both time frames was 21 days. Comparison of subgroups is shown in the table. Conclusions: We found significant changes in management of cancer pts with COVID-19 that evolved over time. Oncologists have become increasingly willing to continue therapy for cancer pts treated with curative intent and pts on oral therapy. Changes in cancer therapy have become more frequently related to patient clinical status, and less so due to institutional policies. It will be important to analyze how these changes in management are ultimately reflected in cancer outcomes in order to equip patients and oncologists to react to the next pandemic.","output":"Patterns in cancer management changes for patients with COVID19 in northern California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated changes of individuals consumption behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored the driving determinants in consumption expenditure in Zhejiang China.

To understand HCWs fears and concerns surrounding PPE, their experiences following its guidance and how these affected their perceived ability to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA rapid qualitative appraisal study combining three sources of data: semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews with frontline HCWs (n=46), media reports (n=39 newspaper articles and 145,000 social media posts) and government PPE policies (n=25). HCWs interviewed were from secondary care, primary care and specialist community clinics. Media and policy data were from across the UK. ResultsA major concern was running out of PPE, putting HCWs and patients at risk of infection. Following national-level guidance was often not feasible when there were shortages, leading to re-use and improvisation of PPE. Frequently changing guidelines generated confusion and distrust. PPE was reserved for high-risk secondary care settings and this translated into HCWs outside these settings feeling inadequately protected. Participants were concerned about inequitable access to PPE for community, lower seniority, female and ethnic minority HCWs. Participants continued delivering care despite the physical discomfort, practical problems and communication barriers associated with PPE use. ConclusionThis study found that frontline HCWs persisted in caring for their patients despite multiple challenges including inappropriate provision of PPE, inadequate training and inconsistent guidance. In order to effectively care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline HCWs need appropriate provision of PPE, training in its use, as well as comprehensive and consistent guidance. These needs must be addressed in order to protect the health and well-being of the most valuable healthcare resource in the COVID-19 pandemic: our HCWs. O_TEXTBOXWhat is already known?- PPE is an important component of infection prevention and control to protect HCWs delivering care on the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak. - Frontline HCWs have reported challenges delivering care in PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. - Research understanding how HCWs responded to these challenges are lacking. What are the new findings?- HCWs faced multiple challenges delivering care including inadequate provision of PPE, inconsistent guidance and lack of training in its use. - HCWs persisted delivering care despite the negative physical effects, practical problems, lack of protected time for breaks and communication barriers associated with wearing PPE. - In the face of training, guidance and procurement gaps, HCWs improvised by developing their own informal communication channels to share information, they trained each other and bought their own PPE. - HCWs reported inequalities accessing PPE based on the healthcare sector, gender, level of seniority and ethnicity. What do the new findings imply?- To feel safe and confident caring for patients, frontline HCWs need to be provided with appropriate size, quality and level of PPE, as well as training in its use. - PPE guidance should be consistent, clearly communicated, and reflect the most up-to-date evidence-base for the safest level of PPE. - Regular breaks for staff working in full PPE should be prioritised even in contexts of understaffing and PPE shortages as these are key aspects of well-being.

In the <17 group, the specificity of non-survivors and survivors is 100.0 and 80.2%, respectively, and the NPV is 81.6%. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated day-3 APACHE II has a high predicting the hospital mortality (X(2) = 6.198, P = 0.625, consistency = 79.4%). However, the day-1 APACHE II has a poor calibration in predicting the hospital mortality rate (X (2) = 294.898, P <0.001).

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The present article discusses this concept. ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects. In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.","output":"Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers and the COVID-19 Pandemic: At Present There Is No Evidence to Abandon Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In the international arena, it is often the case that in countries which largely depend on foreign resources, energy security, and its key components i.e. security of energy supply, environment, technology, geopolitical and economic factors, is a subject of concern. However, due to the abundance of fossil fuel resources in resource-rich exporting nations, there is a lack of understanding of the risks around energy security and accordingly often a policy vacuum. Conceptualising energy security from different geopolitical vantage points will allow future concerns around energy supply security, climate change, and regional economic crises to be evaluated. By using policy documents and developing a time series approach and normalized z-scores for a range of comparable metrics this article compares the energy security performance in six Caspian Sea countries individually and collectively. The article results show that Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan made significant progress in energy security since 1990, while energy security indicators in Russia, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan regressed. Iran has a leading position in energy security performance, while Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have the lowest level of the energy security indicators compare to other region countries.

Patients, clinicians and hospital authorities have had to balance the risks to patients of attending hospital, many of whom are especially vulnerable, with the risks of delaying or modifying cancer treatment. Those whose care has been significantly impacted include patients suffering from the effects of cancer on bone, where delivering the usual standard of care for bone support has often not been possible and clinicians have been forced to seek alternative options for adequate management. At a virtual meeting of the Cancer and Bone Society in July 2020, an expert group shared experiences and solutions to this challenge, following which a questionnaire was sent internationally to the symposiums participants, to explore the issues faced and solutions offered. 70 respondents, from 9 countries (majority USA, 39%, followed by UK, 19%) included 50 clinicians, spread across a diverse range of specialties (but with a high proportion, 64%, of medical oncologists) and 20 who classified themselves as non-clinical (solely lab-based). Spread of clinician specialty across tumour types was breast (65%), prostate (27%), followed by renal, myeloma and melanoma. Analysis showed that management of metastatic bone disease in all solid tumour types and myeloma, adjuvant bisphosphonate breast cancer therapy and cancer treatment induced bone loss, was substantially impacted. Respondents reported delays to routine CT scans (58%), standard bone scans (48%) and MRI scans (46%), though emergency scans were less affected. Delays in palliative radiotherapy for bone pain were reported by 31% of respondents with treatments often involving only a single dose without fractionation. Delays to, or cancellation of, prophylactic surgery for bone pain were reported by 35% of respondents. Access to treatments with intravenous bisphosphonates and subcutaneous denosumab was a major problem, mitigated by provision of drug administration at home or in a local clinic, reduced frequency of administration or switching to oral bisphosphonates taken at home. The questionnaire also revealed damaging delays or complete stopping of both clinical and laboratory research.

However, how signalling integration is regulated and whether the endocytic fate of single receptors controls such signalling integration remains poorly elucidated. Combining quantitative phosphoproteomics and targeted assays, we generated a detailed picture of recycling-dependent fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling in breast cancer cells, with a focus on distinct FGF receptors (FGFRs). We discovered reciprocal priming between FGFRs and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) that is coordinated at recycling endosomes. FGFR recycling ligands induce EGFR phosphorylation on threonine 693. This phosphorylation event alters both FGFR and EGFR trafficking and primes FGFR-mediated proliferation but not cell invasion. In turn, FGFR signalling primes EGF-mediated outputs via EGFR threonine 693 phosphorylation. This reciprocal priming between distinct families of RTKs from recycling endosomes exemplifies a novel signalling integration hub where recycling endosomes orchestrate cellular behaviour. Therefore, targeting reciprocal priming over individual receptors may improve personalized therapies in breast and other cancers.","output":"Reciprocal priming between receptor tyrosine kinases at recycling endosomes orchestrates cellular signalling outputs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID\\\\19 has highlighted differences in our engagement in health prevention behaviors.

SNOW is a window-of-opportunity study designed to evaluate the immune and molecular effects of preoperative sitravatinib and nivolumab in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: Patients with newly-diagnosed untreated T2-4a, N0-2 or T1 >1 cm-N2 oral cavity carcinomas were eligible. All patients received sitravatinib 120 mg daily from day 1 up to 48 hours pre-surgery and one dose of nivolumab 240 mg on day 15. Surgery was planned between day 23 and 30. Standard of care adjuvant radiotherapy was given based on clinical stage. Tumor photographs, fresh tumor biopsies and blood samples were collected at baseline, at day 15 after sitravatinib alone, and at surgery after sitravatinibCnivolumab combination. Tumor flow cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence staining and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) were performed on tumor biopsies to study changes in immune-cell populations. Tumor whole-exome sequencing and circulating tumor DNA and cell-free DNA were evaluated at each time point. RESULTS: Ten patients were included. Grade 3 toxicity occurred in one patient (hypertension); one patient required sitravatinib dose reduction, and one patient required discontinuation and surgery delay due to G2 thrombocytopenia. Nine patients had clinical-to-pathological downstaging, with one complete response. Independent pathological treatment response (PTR) assessment confirmed a complete PTR and two major PTRs. With a median follow-up of 21 months, all patients are alive with no recurrence. Circulating tumor DNA and cell-free DNA dynamics correlated with clinical and pathological response and distinguished two patient groups with different tumor biological behavior after sitravatinib alone (1A) versus sitravatinibCnivolumab (1B). Tumor immunophenotyping and scRNAseq analyses revealed differential changes in the expression of immune cell populations and sitravatinib-targeted and hypoxia-related genes in group 1A vs 1B patients. CONCLUSIONS: The SNOW study shows sitravatinib plus nivolumab is safe and leads to deep clinical and pathological responses in oral cavity carcinomas.

Up to 21.3% of COVID-19 patients presented neurological symptoms. Headache (5.4%), skeletal muscle injury (5.1%), psychiatric disorders (4.6%), impaired consciousness (2.8%), gustatory/olfactory dysfunction (2.3%), acute cerebrovascular events (1.4%), and dizziness (1.3%), were the most frequently reported neurological manifestations. Ischemic stroke occurred among 1.3% of COVID-19 patients. Other less common neurological manifestations were cranial nerve impairment (0.6%), nerve root and plexus disorders (0.4%), epilepsy (0.7%), and hemorrhagic stroke (0.15%). Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were reported in 14% and 4% of patients with a severe disease, respectively, and they were significantly higher compared to non-severe patients (p < 0.05). Individual patient data from 129 COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were extracted: mean age was 64.4 (SD  6.2), 78.5% had anterior circulation occlusions, the mean NIHSS was 15 (SD  7), and the intra-hospital mortality rate was 22.8%. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required among 63% of patients. CONCLUSION: This updated review of literature, shows that headache, skeletal muscle injury, psychiatric disorders, impaired consciousness, and gustatory/olfactory dysfunction were the most common neurological symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were significantly higher among patients with a severe infection. AIS patients required ICU admission in 63% of cases, while intra-hospital mortality rate was close to 23%.

Scores varied between -3 to +3. ResultsThe sample (n=1,164) was weighted to be representative of the states population. Black participants had the lowest overall vaccine acceptance (0.5) compared to White participants (1.2). Hispanic participants had the highest scores (1.4). In adjusted models, Black participants had 0.81 points lower acceptance than White participants, and Hispanic participants had 0.35 points higher acceptance. Hispanic participants had the highest scores for all five vaccine acceptance dimensions, relatively equivalent to White participants. Black participants had consistently lower scores, especially perceived vaccine safety (mean -0.2, SD 0.1).

The patients were randomly stratified into intensive care group and routine care group. After surgery, intensive or routine care was provided, and the prognosis of patients was evaluated, with a subsequent comparative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 109 cases were divided into the routine nursing group (n = 54 cases) and intensive nursing group (n = 55 cases). There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline data before surgery. Postoperative lung infection in the intensive nursing group was significantly less frequent than those in the routine nursing group (5.5% vs. 18.5%, P=0.039) with pulmonary infection and lower extremity venous thrombosis (5.5% vs. 24.1%, P=0.006).

In the absence of hypoxia-induced SETX, R-loop levels increase, DNA damage accumulates, and DNA replication rates decrease. Therefore, suggesting that, SETX plays a role in protecting cells from DNA damage induced during transcription in hypoxia. Importantly, we propose that the mechanism of SETX induction in hypoxia is reliant on the PERK/ATF4 arm of the unfolded protein response.

Israel was one of the first countries to widely use the Comirnaty vaccine. AIM: We aimed to assess the vaccine's short-term side effects directly from a large population and to predict influencing factors for self-reporting side effects. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we investigated self-reported systemic vaccine side-effects using electronic surveys sent to vaccinated individuals between 20 December 2020 and 11 March 2021, within 3 days following administration of the first and second dose. We determined predictors for reporting systemic side effects by logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1,213,693 patients received at least one vaccine dose and 301,537 (24.8%) answered at least one survey. Among them, 68,162 (30.4%) and 89,854 (59.9%) individuals filled the first and the second dose surveys, respectively, and reported one or more side effects. Most common side effects were fatigue, headache and myalgia. Several respondents reported facial paraesthesia after first and second dose, respectively (n = 1,675; 0.7% and n = 1,601; 1.1%). Individuals younger than 40 years and women reported side effects more frequently than others, but pregnant women reported less. Pregnancy was a weak predictor for reporting any side effect in general and in particular fatigue, myalgia, headache, chills and fever.

In this context, a question can be posed whether it is possible to approach and understand these phenomena in other ways, and consequently respond in a different manner. In search for alternative approaches to the problem of human greed and fear, this article investigates their conceptualisations from the perspective of the Theravada Abhidhamma, an important formulation of ancient Indian Buddhist philosophy. The Abbidhamma analyses and expounds the processes of cognition, using a multivalent and complex structure, comprised of interrelated and interdependent components (dhamma), which are involved in the ever-changing flow of mental and physical phenomena. This article proposes that the entirety of the structural cognitive model of the Abbidbamma is founded on, and permeated by ethics. The components involved in cognitive processes are classified in three ways, as ethical, unethical, or indeterminate;greed and fear are presented as components of unethical mental states, which in turn may lead to actions that are harmful to oneself and society. This Abhidhammic analysis of cognition provides a model, in which a different conceptualisation of greed and fear is presented;it identifies those components and conditions for cognition which allow for an ethical (kusala) stance and consequently ethical actions. The article thus propounds that the knowledge of cognitive models of ancient India can be relevant to the search for new approaches to contemporary ethical challenges, and may contribute to a different understanding of, and responses to, greed and fear.","output":"The Ethical Foundations of Buddhist Cognitive Models: Presentations of Greed and Fear in the Theravada Abhidhamma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residents of long-term care facilities (LCTFs) have high morbidity and mortality associated with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Limited information exists on the virology of ARI in LTCFs, where virological testing is reactive. We report on findings of a surveillance feasibility substudy from a larger prospective trial of introducing rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) at 10 Wisconsin LTCFs. Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using 2. Totals of 160, 215, and 122 specimens were collected during 2016?2017, 2017?2018, and 2018?2019, respectively. Respiratory pathogen panel identified viruses in 54.8% of tested specimens. Influenza A (19.2%), influenza B (12.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), and human metapneumovirus (20.9%) accounted for 69% of all detections, whereas coronaviruses (17.2%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (10.5%) and parainfluenza (3.8%) were less common.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the template preference of the RNA replicase is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of the viral nonstructural polyprotein. Cis-acting RNA elements in the viral genome also play crucial roles in regulating genome replication and subgenomic RNA transcription. In this report, a series of RNA templates were analyzed in vitro and in vivo to define functional elements in the 5' end of the genome. The 5' UTR was shown to contain distinct core promoter elements for both minus- and plus-strand synthesis. In addition, two conserved stem-loop structures within the nsP1 coding sequence enhanced RNA replication but were not required. Studies with chimeric templates and trans-competition experiments suggest that the 5' determinant for minus-strand initiation can differ among alphaviruses and binds to one or more limiting replicase components. The results provide compelling evidence that the 5' and 3' ends of alphavirus genome RNAs must interact to initiate replication and we propose one model for how this interaction might occur. In addition to providing new insight into the initiation of alphavirus genome replication, these results have implications for the development of improved alphavirus vector systems with reduced recombination potential.","output":"Cis-acting RNA elements at the 5' end of Sindbis virus genome RNA regulate minus- and plus-strand RNA synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology to generate single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets and tools to annotate them have advanced rapidly in the past several years. Such tools generally rely on existing transcriptomic datasets or curated databases of cell type defining genes, while the application of scalable natural language processing (NLP) methods to enhance analysis workflows has not been adequately explored. Here we deployed an NLP framework to objectively quantify associations between a comprehensive set of over 20,000 human protein-coding genes and over 500 cell type terms across over 26 million biomedical documents. The resultant gene-cell type associations (GCAs) are significantly stronger between a curated set of matched cell type-marker pairs than the complementary set of mismatched pairs (Mann Whitney p = 6.15  10(?76), r = 0.24; cohens D = 2.6). Building on this, we developed an augmented annotation algorithm (single cell Annotation via Literature Encoding, or scALE) that leverages GCAs to categorize cell clusters identified in scRNA-seq datasets, and we tested its ability to predict the cellular identity of 133 clusters from nine datasets of human breast, colon, heart, joint, ovary, prostate, skin, and small intestine tissues. With the optimized settings, the true cellular identity matched the top prediction in 59% of tested clusters and was present among the top five predictions for 91% of clusters. scALE slightly outperformed an existing method for reference data driven automated cluster annotation, and we demonstrate that integration of scALE can meaningfully improve the annotations derived from such methods. Further, contextualization of differential expression analyses with these GCAs highlights poorly characterized markers of well-studied cell types, such as CLIC6 and DNASE1L3 in retinal pigment epithelial cells and endothelial cells, respectively.

MHV particles have a distinctly spherical shape and a relatively homogenous size ( approximately 85 nm envelope diameter). The viral envelope exhibits an unusual thickness (7.8 +/- 0.7 nm), almost twice that of a typical biological membrane. Focal pairs revealed the existence of an extra internal layer, most likely formed by the C-terminal domains of the major envelope protein M. In the interior of the particles, coiled structures and tubular shapes are observed, consistent with a helical nucleocapsid model. Our reconstructions provide no evidence of a shelled core. Instead, the ribonucleoprotein seems to be extensively folded onto itself, assuming a compact structure that tends to closely follow the envelope at a distance of approximately 4 nm. Focal contact points and thread-like densities connecting the envelope and the ribonucleoprotein are revealed in the tomograms.

Anesthesiology programs have adopted alternate methods of recruitment, including virtual open houses and social media, due to limiting personal contact rules implemented by AAMC. This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of virtual events hosted and social media accounts created by programs. METHODS: Anesthesiology residency programs and departments were examined for social media presence on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Programs websites and social media posts were reviewed for virtual open house opportunities. Available sub-internships were collected from the Visiting Student Application Service database. Data was collected after 2020C2021 pre-interview recruitment in October 2020. RESULTS: Of 153 total anesthesiology residency programs, 96 (63%) had some form of social media presence. The platforms of choice for programs with social media accounts included Twitter (71, or 46%), Instagram (67, or 44%), and Facebook (47, or 31%). Forty of seventy-six residency-affiliated accounts were created after March 1, 2020; Instagram accounts (26 of 40) represented most of these.

The disorder is most commonly associated with gynecological and breast carcinomas, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and Hodgkins disease and in most cases comes on prior to identification of the underlying neoplasm. The hallmark of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is the presence of an immune response reactive with intracellular proteins of Purkinje or other neurons or, less commonly, against neuronal surface antigens. Evidence-based treatment strategies for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration do not exist; and approaches to therapy are thus speculative. Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying neoplasm is critical, and characterization of the antibody response involved may assist in tumor diagnosis. Most investigators have initiated treatment with corticosteroids, plasma exchange, or intravenous immunoglobulin G. Cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, rituximab, or possibly mycophenolate mofetil may warrant consideration in patients who fail to stabilize or improve on less aggressive therapies. Plasma exchange has been of questionable benefit when used alone but should be considered at initiation of treatment to achieve rapid lowering of circulating paraneoplastic autoantibodies. Because the course of illness is one of relentless neuronal destruction, time is of the essence in initiating treatment.

The COVID-Evidence database shows 2,814 COVID-19 randomized trials registered as of February 16, 2021. Most were small (only 18% have a planned sample size >500) and the rare completed ones have not provided published results promptly (only 283 trial publications as of 2/2021). Small randomized trials and observational, non-randomized analyses have not had a successful track record and have generated misleading expectations. Different large trials on the same intervention have generally been far more efficient in producing timely and consistent evidence. The rapid generation of evidence and accelerated dissemination of results have led to new challenges for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (e.g. rapid, living, and scoping reviews). Pressure to regulatory agencies has also mounted with massive emergency authorizations, but some of them have had to be revoked. Pandemic circumstances have disrupted the way trials are conducted; therefore, new methods have been developed and adopted more widely to facilitate recruitment, consent, and overall trial conduct. Based on the COVID-19 experience and its challenges, planning of several large, efficient trials, and wider use of adaptive designs may change the future of clinical research. Pragmatism, integration in clinical care, efficient administration, promotion of collaborative structures, and enhanced integration of existing data and facilities may be several of the legacies of COVID-19 on future randomized trials.","output":"Challenges and lessons learned from Covid-19 trials C should we be doing clinical trials differently?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] RT-PCR is the primary method to diagnose COVID-19 and is also used to monitor the disease course.

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: 1) people actively share their experience of COVID-19 via online social media, 2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting on social media, and 3) online users are frequently equipped with powerful mobile devices that can perform data processing and analytics. We envision unprecedented opportunities to leverage posts generated by ordinary people to build real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating COVID-19 propagation data. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information on COVID-19 with prevailing rumors and misinformation? How to inform the general public about the state of the spread timely and effectively? How to leverage the computational power on edge devices to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines can be effective in addressing the challenges.

To gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of these ECNRs, we compared them with the characteristics of senior nurse researchers (SNRs: age 46 years). DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: 1532 nurse researchers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We conducted an anonymous online questionnaire survey that assessed individual and professional attributes of nurse researchers and their experiences from April to June 2020. We analysed the association between the impact on research activities and the individual and professional attributes using cross-tabulation, and employed the chi-square automatic interaction detection technique to perform population segmentation. RESULTS: We found that difficulties in research management, an increased burden of student education and organisational management, and organisational management position were relatively important factors for determining the negative impact of COVID-19 on the research activities of ECNRs (p<0.05). For both ECNRs and SNRs, the most relevant determinant of disrupted research activities was difficulties in research management ((2)=34.7 and 126.5, respectively, p<0.001 for both). However, only ECNRs yielded position in organisational management and was extracted only for ECNRs ((2)=7.0, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Difficulties in research management and an increased burden of student education and organisational management had an unfavourable impact on the research activities of ECNRs. To ensure quality of nursing care and nursing science development during and after the COVID-19 era, it is important to support ECNRs in their nursing research activities and career development. Our findings could contribute to the prioritisation of interventions and policymaking for ECNRs who are particularly at risk of being negatively affected by the pandemic.","output":"Characteristics of early-career nurse researchers negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new infectious disease, COVID-19, has spread around the world The most common symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are cough and fever, but severe cases can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome The main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human tissue is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and the lungs, heart, and kidneys are the most affected organs Besides the inflammatory process and tissue damage, the presence of a cytokine \\"storm\\" has been related to a higher mortality rate Other infectious viral diseases, such as Zika, chikungunya, and influenza, were associated with complications in pregnant women, such as growth restriction, malformation, preterm birth, low birth weight, miscarriage, and death, although they can also cause developmental disorders in infants and adolescents Evidence points out that stressors during pregnancy and infancy may lead to the development of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease Therefore, we hypothesize that COVID-19 infection during the critical phases of development can program the individual to chronic diseases in adulthood It is important that COVID-19 patients receive proper monitoring as a way to avoid expensive costs to public health in the future","output":"COVID-19 During Development: A Matter of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 and the virus-induced disease COVID-19 has caused widespread concerns due to its contagiousness, fatality rate, and the absence of drug(s) This study investigated Lens culinaris and its phytochemicals, especially the flavonoids The compounds were assessed through molecular docking studies for their binding abilities with the major protease of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6LU7) A total of 42 phytochemicals of Lens culinaris were analyzed through molecular docking studies for their binding affinities to COVID 3C-like protease Of them, 23 compounds were found to have binding affinities to the protease of -7 5 kcal/mol or higher Our study indicates that Lens culinaris contains a number of polyphenolic compounds as well as phytosterols, which can bind to the active site of the protease, and so merits further scientific attention on trials for use as potential anti-COVID-19 drugs","output":"Evaluation of Lens culinaris phytochemicals in binding to the 3c-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 - a molecular docking approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the impact of dietary weight loss (WL) plus aerobic exercise (EX) and a \\"move more, more often\\" approach to activity promotion (SitLess; SL) on WL and maintenance.

Participants received a social-cognitive group-mediated behavioral WL program for 6 months, followed by a 12-month maintenance period. EX participants received guided walking exercise with the goal of walking 150 min/wk. SL attempted to achieve a step goal by moving frequently during the day. The primary outcome was body weight at 18 months, with secondary outcomes including weight regain from 6 to 18 months and objectively assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior at each time point.

Persons living in or visiting the FTA are exposed to specific risks, mainly severe road traffic injuries, envenoming, stab or ballistic wounds, and emergent tropical infectious diseases. These diseases may require specific knowledge and critical care management. However, there are not enough ICU beds in the FTA. Indeed, there are 7.2 ICU beds/100 000 population in Guadeloupe, 7.2 in Martinique, and 4.5 in French Guiana. In addition, seriously ill patients in remote areas regularly have to be transferred, most often by helicopter, resulting in a delay in admission to intensive care. The COVID-19 crisis has shown that the health care system in the FTA is unready to face such an epidemic and that intensive care bed capacity must be increased. In conclusion, the critical care sector in the FTA requires upgrading of infrastructure, human resources, and equipment as well as enhancement of multidisciplinary care.

These findings were obtained in surveys using self-report questionnaires with pre-specified response options that may not capture the broad range of experiences of individuals affected by cancer, including people with cancer and informal caregivers, in this unprecedented situation. Online forums produce a large amount of valuable first-hand user-generated content that can be used to better understand their day-to-day lives. This study, based on the analysis of narratives in cancer online forums, aims to describe and categorize the experiences of people affected by cancer during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An inductive, descriptive, thematic approach was applied to publicly available cancer forums from Germany, the USA, the UK, and Ireland posted between mid-March and mid-April 2020. RESULTS: An analysis of the content of 230 main posts revealed three major themes: (1) concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care, the risks and fears of getting infected, logistic issues, and economic impact; (2) adaptation challenges faced at the individual and societal level; and (3) the need for advice including information about COVID-19 and the (self-)management of cancer symptoms and treatment.

Therefore, ED is typically linked to a web of closely interrelated cardiovascular risk factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Physical activity (PA) has proved to be a protective factor against erectile problems, and it has been shown to improve erectile function for men affected by vascular ED. This systematic review estimated the levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men with physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or manifest cardiovascular diseases. AIM To provide recommendations of levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men with physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases. METHODS In accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was performed of research articles specifically investigating PA as a possible treatment of ED. The review included research on ED from physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases. All available studies from 2006 through 2016 were checked for the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to analyze the levels of PA needed to decrease ED. RESULTS 10 articles met the inclusion criteria, all suggesting various levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men with relevant risk factors for ED. The results of the review provided sufficient research evidence for conclusions regarding the levels of PA necessary to decrease ED. CONCLUSION Recommendations of PA to decrease ED should include supervised training consisting of 40 minutes of aerobic exercise of moderate to vigorous intensity 4 times per week. Overall, weekly exercise of 160 minutes for 6 months contributes to decreasing erectile problems in men with ED caused by physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases.

Typically, however, HSP, HSU, and technology developers engaged to produce the resources lack expertise in participatory design methodologies suited to the eHealth context. Furthermore, it can be difficult to identify an established method to use, or determine how to work stepwise through any particular process. OBJECTIVE We sought to summarize the evidence about participatory methods and frameworks used to engage HSU in the development of eHealth resources from the beginning of the design process. METHODS We searched for studies reporting participatory processes in initial development of eHealth resources from 2006 to 2016 in 9 bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Emcare, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ACM Guide to Computing Literature, and IEEE Xplore. From 15,117 records initially screened on title and abstract for relevance to eHealth and early participatory design, 603 studies were assessed for eligibility on full text. The remaining 90 studies were rated by 2 reviewers using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2011 (Pluye et al; MMAT) and analyzed with respect to health area, purpose, technology type, and country of study. The 30 studies scoring 90% or higher on MMAT were included in a detailed qualitative synthesis. RESULTS Of the 90 MMAT-rated studies, the highest reported (1) health areas were cancer and mental disorders, (2) eHealth technologies were websites and mobile apps, (3) targeted populations were youth and women, and (4) countries of study were the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Of the top 30 studies the highest reported participatory frameworks were User-Centered Design, Participatory Action Research Framework, and the Center for eHealth Research and Disease Management (CeHRes) Roadmap, and the highest reported model underpinning development and engagement was Social Cognitive Theory. Of the 30 studies, 4 reported on all the 5 stages of the CeHRes Roadmap. CONCLUSIONS The top 30 studies yielded 24 participatory frameworks. Many studies referred to using participatory design methods without reference to a framework. The application of a structured framework such as the CeHRes Roadmap and a model such as Social Cognitive Theory creates a foundation for a well-designed eHealth initiative that ensures clarity and enables replication across participatory design projects. The framework and model need to be clearly articulated and address issues that include resource availability, responsiveness to change, and the criteria for good practice. This review creates an information resource for future eHealth developers, to guide the design of their eHealth resource with a framework that can support further evaluation and development.

The switch of test procedure will not only affect the effectiveness of technologies but also change the fuel consumption target of the industry. However, few studies have systematically investigated the impacts of the new WLTP on the Chinese market. This study establishes a technologyCvehicleCfleet bottomCup framework to estimate the impacts of test procedure switching on technology effectiveness and regulation stringency. The results show that due to the WLTP being closer to the real driving condition and more stringent, almost all baseline vehicles in the WLTP have higher fuel consumption than that in the NEDC, and diesel vehicles are slightly more impacted than gasoline vehicles. In addition, the impacts are increased with the strengthening of electrification, where the fuel consumption of plugCin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) in the WLTP are about 6% higher than that in the NEDC. Engine technologies that gain higher effects in low load conditions, such as turbocharging and downsizing, fuel stratified injection (FSI), leanCburn, and variable valve timing (VVT), are faced with deterioration in the WLTP. Among these, the effect of turbocharging and downsizing shows a maximum decline of 8.5%. The variable compression ratio (VCR) and stoichiometric gasoline direct injection (SGDI) are among the few technologies that benefited from procedure switching, with an average improvement of 1.6% and 0.2% respectively. Except for multiCspeed transmissions, which have improvement effects in the WLTP, all automatic transmissions are faced with decreases. From the perspective of the whole fleet and national regulation target, the average fuel consumption in the WLTP will increase by about 7.5% in 2025 compared to 4 L/100 km in the NEDC. According to the current planning of the Chinese government, the fuel consumption target of Phase V is set at 4.6 L/100 km in 2025, which is equivalent to loosening the stringency by 0.3 L/100 km. In Phase VI, the target of 3.2 L/100 km is maintained, which is 30.4% stricter than that of Phase V, and the annual compound tightening rate reaches 7.5%. This means that automakers need to launch their product planning as soon as possible and expand the technology bandwidth to comply with the Phase VI fuel consumption regulation, and the government should evaluate the technical feasibility before determining the evaluation methods and targets of the next phase.","output":"Impacts of the New Worldwide Light-Duty Test Procedure on Technology Effectiveness and Chinas Passenger Vehicle Fuel Consumption Regulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bu makalede bilim ve kurgu portreleri zerinden bir tr ya?anan gelecek sorgulamas? yap?lmaktad?r. ?al??mada teknolojinin engin dnyas?na sosyal bilimlerin ele?tirelli?iyle yakla?an d?nrlerin izleri varsa da;bu teorik arkaplan, bu makalede teknolojinin ?a?c?l d?n?m ve felsefi yans?malar? gere?ince yeniden mercek alt?na al?nmaktad?r.

Although there are traces of thinkers who approach the vast world of technology with the criticism of humanities;this theoretical background is brought into focus in this article in accordance with the modern transformation of technology and its philosophical reflections. Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 epidemic, which affects the entire globe and legitimizes many technological experiences, makes this questioning a timely initiative. As a matter of fact, ancient themes of science and fiction such as space, time, war, machines, robots, artificial intelligence, data, gene, bio-technology, microbes, viruses, body, health, death / immortality, memory, cyber-world, authority, automation, space, climate, demography, vehicles and devices have made modern people witnesses to themselves rather than viewers in the hands of this epidemic. This article, which looks at this testimony embodied in science fiction from a close distance, examines the appearance of the dim tunnel through which the modern world enters in a dark way. For this purpose, the relationship between science and fiction, between science fiction and reality, between reality and future, between tools and modern people, and between philosophy and futurism is debated.","output":"Teknolojinin Neresindeyiz?

Several biochemical studies show strong binding of heparin and heparin-like molecules to the Spike protein, which resulted in inhibition of viral infection to cells. The clinical observations and in vitro studies argue for a potential multiple-targeting effects of heparin. However, adverse effects of heparin administration and some of the challenges using heparin therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection need to be considered.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, for-profit providers have been accused of failing their residents by prioritising profits over care, prevention, and caution, which has been reported to result in a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infections and deaths in for-profit care homes. Although many of these reports are anecdotal or based on news reports, there is a growing body of academic research investigating ownership variation across COVID-19 outcomes, which has not been systematically appraised and synthesised. Objectives: To identify, appraise, and synthesise the available research on ownership variation in COVID-19 outcomes (outbreaks, infections, deaths, shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and staff) across for-profit, public, and non-profit care homes for older people, and to update our findings as new research becomes available. Design: Living systematic review. Methods: This review was prospectively registered with Prospero (CRD42020218673). We searched 17 databases and performed forward and backward citation tracking of all included studies. Search results were screened and reviewed in duplicate. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed in duplicate according to the COSMOS-E guidance. The results were synthesised according to RoB, model adjustment, and country context and visualised using harvest plots. Results: Twenty-eight studies across five countries were included, with 75% of included studies conducted in the Unites States. For-profit ownership was not consistently associated with a higher probability of COVID-19 outbreaks across included studies. However, there was compelling evidence of worse COVID-19 outcomes following an outbreak; with for-profit care homes having higher rates of accumulative infections and deaths. For-profit providers were also associated with shortages in PPE, which may have contributed to the higher incidence of infections and deaths. Chain affiliation was often found to be correlated with higher risk of outbreaks, but not consistently associated with an elevated number of deaths and infections. Private equity ownership was not consistently associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusion: For-profit status was a consistent risk factor for higher cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths. Thus, ownership among providers may be a key modifiable factor which can be regulated to improve health outcomes in vulnerable populations and reduce health disparities. This review will be updated as new research becomes published, which may change the conclusion of our synthesis.","output":"Ownership and COVID-19 in care homes for older people: A living systematic review of outbreaks, infections, and mortalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence of the involvement of the cardiovascular system in patients with COVID-19 is increasing. The evaluation of the subclinical cardiac involvement is crucial for risk stratification at admission, and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) may be useful for this purpose. A total of 87 consecutive patients admitted to the COVID Center were enrolled from December 2020 to April 2021. A complete echocardiography examination was performed within 72 hours from admission. The main outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation by way of orotracheal intubation (OTI) and mortality, and the secondary outcome was the worsening of the respiratory function during hospitalization, interpreted as a decrease of the ratio between the partial pressure of oxygen and the fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) <100. Of 87 patients, 14 had severe disease leading to OTI or death, whereas 24 had a P/F <100. LVGLS was significantly impaired in patients with severe disease. After adjustment for risk factors, by considering LVGLS as continuous variable, the latter remained significantly associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (P/F <100) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.88, p = 0.001) and OTI/death (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.38, p = 0.012). When using an LVGLS cutoff of ?16.1%, LVGLS  ?16.1% was independently associated with a higher risk of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 4.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 11.1, p= 0.008) and OTI/death (HR 7.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 34.1, p = 0.024).

However, lockdown measures during COVID-19 have limited people's opportunity to exercise regularly. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks of Fitness and Dance training, followed by four weeks of COVID-19-induced detraining, on cardiac adaptations and physical performance indicators in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Twelve older adults (6 males and 6 females) with MCI (age, 73  4.4 y; body mass, 75.3  6.4 kg; height, 172  8 cm; MMSE score: 24-27) participated in eight weeks of a combined Fitness-Dance training intervention (two sessions/week) followed by four weeks of training cessation induced by COVID-19 lockdowns. Wireless Polar Team Pro and Polar heart rate sensors (H10) were used to monitor covered distance, speed, heart rate (HR min, avg and max), time in HR zone 1 to 5, strenuousness (load score), beat-to-beat interval (max RR and avg RR) and heart rate variability (HRV-RMSSD). One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data of the three test sessions (T1: first training session, T2: last training session of the eight-week training program, and T3: first training session after the four-week training cessation). Statistical analysis showed that eight weeks of combined Fitness-Dance training induced beneficial cardiac adaptations by decreasing HR (HR min, HR avg and HR max) with p < 0.001, ES = 0.5-0.6 and &#916; = -7 to-9 bpm, and increasing HRV related responses (max and avg RR and RMSSD), with p < 0.01 and ES = 0.4. Consequently, participants spent more time in comfortable HR zones (e.g., p < 0.0005; ES = 0.7; &#916; = 25% for HR zone 1) and showed reduced strenuousness (p = 0.02, &#916; = -15% for load score), despite the higher covered total distance and average speed (p < 0.01; ES = 0.4). However, these changes were reversed after only four weeks of COVID-19 induced detraining, with values of all parameters returning to their baseline levels. In conclusion, eight weeks of combined Fitness-Dance training seems to be an efficient strategy to promote cardioprotective benefits in older adults with MCI. Importantly, to maintain these health benefits, training has to be continued and detraining periods should be reduced. During a pandemic, home-based exercise programs may provide an effective and efficient alternative of physical training.","output":"Four Weeks of Detraining Induced by COVID-19 Reverse Cardiac Improvements from Eight Weeks of Fitness-Dance Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus-like particles (VLPs) are nanostructures that possess diverse applications in therapeutics, immunization, and diagnostics.

Using inflation rate levels as a starting point to characterize when these countries began their transitions, it shows that after 1996 both real GDP growth and real interest rates move together to a significant degree both with each other and with the US. This provides a background from which to view the paths since the collapse of the Soviet Union that these transition economies have taken. In addition, comparison is made to US money and banking policy, to provide an outline of how this may impact progress in the transition region. A subsequent summary of the other articles in the issue shows an inter-relation in their themes about how Central, Eastern, and Southeast Europe have progressed since 1991, and how these paths may be affected by Western economic policy. Implications for Central European audience: The paper shows that transition regions can be impacted by international financial integration, including to possible detriment when capital markets are regulated by policy that pushes real interest rates below their natural levels.

This is cause for concern with regard to bioethics and good clinical practice. The evidence for the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is currently derived from open label trials and cell culture studies with no conclusive evidence available from randomised clinical trials.

Universal youth-focused substance use prevention programs have demonstrated effectiveness but are often not sustainable due to the significant amount of time, effort, and resources required. We describe a trial protocol for a brief, low-participant-burden intervention to improve substance use-specific parent-child communication through the promotion of family meals and increased parental engagement. METHODS: This study is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of a 13-week intervention. A total of 500 dyads of parents and their 5(th)-7(th) grade children are recruited from across Massachusetts. Dyads are randomized to the intervention or attention-control condition using block urn randomization, based on child grade, gender, and school. Parents/guardians in the substance use preventive intervention arm receive a short handbook, attend two meetings with an interventionist, and receive two SMS messages per week. Parents/guardians in the control arm receive the same dose but with content focused on nutrition, physical activity, and weight stigma. Participant dyads submit videos of family meals, audio recordings of prompted conversations, and quantitative surveys over an 18-month period (baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 months post-intervention). The primary outcomes measure the quantity and quality of parent-child substance use conversations and proximal child indicators (i.e., substance use attitudes and expectancies, affiliation with substance-using peers, and intentions and willingness to use substances). The secondary outcome is child substance use initiation. DISCUSSION: This is a novel, brief, communication-focused intervention for parents/guardians that was designed to reduce participant burden. The intervention has the potential to improve parent-child engagement and communication and conversations about substance use specifically and decrease child substance use risk factors and substance use initiation.

Shared phones and privacy concerns have been described as challenges, but can be addressed with enhanced security features. Response rates to SMS surveys varied significantly by topic, population, and setting. SUMMARY: SMS may improve generalizability and precision of health and behavior data for HIV in research and programs, but use in LMICs is limited. SMS systems should be carefully designed to overcome potential implementation hurdles.","output":"Utility of Short Message Service (SMS) for Remote Data Collection for HIV in Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the safety of elective urological surgery performed during the pandemic by estimating the prevalence of COVID-19-like symptoms in the postoperative period and its correlation with perioperative and clinical factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this multicenter, observational study we recorded clinical, surgical and postoperative data of consecutive patients undergoing elective urological surgery in 28 different institutions across Italy during initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (between February 24 and March 30, 2020, inclusive). RESULTS: A total of 1943 patients were enrolled. In 12%, 7.1%, 21.3%, 56.7% and 2.6% of cases an open, laparoscopic, robotic, endoscopic or percutaneous surgical approach was performed, respectively. Overall, 166 (8.5%) postoperative complications were registered, 77 (3.9%) surgical and 89 (4.6%) medical. Twenty-eight (1.4%) patients were readmitted to hospital after discharge and 13 (0.7%) died. In the 30 days following discharge, fever and respiratory symptoms were recorded in 101 (5.2%) and 60 (3.1%) patients. At multivariable analysis, not performing nasopharyngeal swab at hospital admission (HR 2.3; CI 95% 1.01C5.19; p = 0.04) was independently associated with risk of developing postoperative medical complications. Number of patients in the facility was confirmed as an independent predictor of experiencing postoperative respiratory symptoms (p = 0.047, HR:1.12; CI95% 1.00C1.05), while COVID-19-free type of hospitalization facility was a strong independent protective factor (p = 0.02, HR:0.23, CI95% 0.07C0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Performing elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to affect perioperative outcomes as long as proper preventive measures are adopted, including nasopharyngeal swab before hospital admission and hospitalization in dedicated COVID-19-free facilities.","output":"Perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing urological elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national overview across 28 Italian institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The ability to identify residents of care homes in routinely collected health care data is key to informing healthcare planning decisions and delivery initiatives targeting the older and frail population. Health-care planning and delivery implications at national level concerning this population subgroup have considerably and suddenly grown in urgency following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has especially hit care homes. The range of applicability of this information has widened with the increased availability in England of retrospectively collected administrative databases, holding rich patient-level details on health and prognostic status who have made or are in contact with the National Health Service. In practice lack of a national registry of care homes residents in England complicates assessing an individuals care home residency status, which has been typically identified via manual address matching from pseudonymised patient-level healthcare databases linked with publicly availably care home address information. OBJECTIVES: To examine a novel methodology based on linking unique care home address identifiers with primary care patient registration data, enabling routine identification of care home residents in health-care data. METHODS: This study benchmarks the proposed strategy against the manual address matching standard approach through a diagnostic assessment of a stratified random sample of care home post codes in England. RESULTS: Derived estimates of diagnostic performance, albeit showing a non-insignificant false negative rate (21.98%), highlight a remarkable true negative rate (99.69%) and positive predictive value (99.35%) as well as a satisfactory negative predictive value (88.25%).

Game theory has been proven as a very effective tool in modelling the decision-making processes of intelligent agents, entities, and players. It has been used to model scenarios from diverse fields such as economics, evolutionary biology, and computer science. In defence applications, there is often a need to model and predict the actions of hostile actors, and players who try to evade or out-smart each other. Modelling how the actions of competitive players shape the decision making of each other is the forte of game theory. In past decades, there have been several studies that applied different branches of game theory to model a range of defence-related scenarios. This paper provides a structured review of such attempts, and classifies existing literature in terms of the kind of warfare modelled, the types of games used, and the players involved. After careful selection, a total of 29 directly relevant papers are discussed and classified. In terms of the warfares modelled, we recognise that most papers that apply game theory in defence settings are concerned with Command and Control Warfare, and can be further classified into papers dealing with (i) Resource Allocation Warfare (ii) Information Warfare (iii) Weapons Control Warfare, and (iv) Adversary Monitoring Warfare. We also observe that most of the reviewed papers are concerned with sensing, tracking, and large sensor networks, and the studied problems have parallels in sensor network analysis in the civilian domain. In terms of the games used, we classify the reviewed papers into papers that use non-cooperative or cooperative games, simultaneous or sequential games, discrete or continuous games, and non-zero-sum or zero-sum games. Similarly, papers are also classified into two-player, three-player or multi-player game based papers. We also explore the nature of players and the construction of payoff functions in each scenario. Finally, we also identify gaps in literature where game theory could be fruitfully applied in scenarios hitherto unexplored using game theory. The presented analysis provides a concise summary of the state-of-the-art with regards to the use of game theory in defence applications and highlights the benefits and limitations of game theory in the considered scenarios.","output":"Game Theory in Defence Applications: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some infectious diseases, including COVID-19, can undergo airborne transmission. This may happen at close proximity, but as time indoors increases, infections can occur in shared room air despite distancing. We propose two indicators of infection risk for this situation, that is, relative risk parameter (Hr) and risk parameter (H). They combine the key factors that control airborne disease transmission indoors: virus-containing aerosol generation rate, breathing flow rate, masking and its quality, ventilation and aerosol-removal rates, number of occupants, and duration of exposure. COVID-19 outbreaks show a clear trend that is consistent with airborne infection and enable recommendations to minimize transmission risk. Transmission in typical prepandemic indoor spaces is highly sensitive to mitigation efforts. Previous outbreaks of measles, influenza, and tuberculosis were also assessed. Measles outbreaks occur at much lower risk parameter values than COVID-19, while tuberculosis outbreaks are observed at higher risk parameter values. Because both diseases are accepted as airborne, the fact that COVID-19 is less contagious than measles does not rule out airborne transmission. It is important that future outbreak reports include information on masking, ventilation and aerosol-removal rates, number of occupants, and duration of exposure, to investigate airborne transmission.","output":"Practical Indicators for Risk of Airborne Transmission in Shared Indoor Environments and Their Application to COVID-19 Outbreaks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our previous research has shown a relationship between low voluntary alcohol consumption and high conditioned fear in male Long Evans rats.

Based on their consumption during the last 2 weeks of alcohol access, the alcohol-access rats were divided into high drinking (>2.5 g/kg/24-h) or low drinking (<2 g/kg/24-h).

Pre-training naltrexone increased conditioned suppression of lever-pressing during training and testing, with no differences between high versus low alcohol drinkers or between water-only versus alcohol access groups (averaged across drinking levels). There was no effect of LY2456302 on conditioned fear in any comparison.

Four large-scale studies provide evidence that collectivism (versus individualism) positively predicts mask usage-both within the United States and across the world. Analyzing a dataset of all 3,141 counties of the 50 US states (based on 248,941 individuals), Study 1a revealed that mask usage was higher in more collectivistic US states. Study 1b replicated this finding in another dataset of 16,737 individuals in the 50 US states.

While Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis are the most dominant species causing life-threatening candidiasis, C. auris recently emerged as a new species causing invasive infections with high rates of clinical treatment failures. To mimic initial phases of systemic Candida infections with dissemination via the bloodstream and to elucidate the pathogenic potential of C. auris, we used an ex vivo whole blood infection model. Similar to other clinically relevant Candida spp., C. auris is efficiently killed in human blood, but showed characteristic patterns of immune cell association, survival rates, and cytokine induction. Dual-species transcriptional profiling of C. auris-infected blood revealed a unique C. auris gene expression program during infection, while the host response proofed similar and conserved compared to other Candida species. C. auris-specific responses included adaptation and survival strategies, such as counteracting oxidative burst of immune cells, but also expression of potential virulence factors, (drug) transporters, and cell surface-associated genes. Despite comparable pathogenicity to other Candida species in our model, C. auris-specific transcriptional adaptations as well as its increased stress resistance and long-term environmental survival, likely contribute to the high risk of contamination and distribution in a nosocomial setting. Moreover, infections of neutrophils with pre-starved C. auris cells suggest that environmental preconditioning can have modulatory effects on the early host interaction.

Face-to-face communication has been banned by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and had to be replaced with its electronic remote form. Popular digital applications allowed us to switch to online life quite easily. That conversion wasn't problematic for most (especially young) people. Working online and meeting people virtually became a standard, and people have mostly adapted to the new reality. Moving conventional communication to the Internet wasn't much challenging, because it was only a matter of existing ICT solutions popularization. They have already existed and were functional, but haven't been used much often. COVID-19 pandemic changed it permanently because there was no other way as rapid adoption to this unusual situation. Although most of the actions could have been realized online, some were more problematic to conduct electronically. One of them was secret balloting for virtual meetings. As open voting was not much complicated to arrange using remote communication, conduction the secret type of elections was not so obvious. In open voting electors' data can be revealed and the results may be easily verified when it's finished. Secret voting demands to remain voters' data and their choices confidential. That leads to the question of how to verify the users' identity and voting rights and keep them anonymous at the same time? This paper provides an overview of a person's remote identification and verification methods, also explores the possibilities of using them for secret voting authentication. Results show that conducting a secret ballot with remote voter authentication is possible. The method was widely described and also applied in a authors' digital system. A fully functional ICT solution has been tested in real elections across several organizations in Poland, in which present authorities were elected electronically during the COVID-19 lockdown period. ? 2021 The Authors.

Here, we present an efficient, competitive serological assay that can simultaneously determine an individuals seroreactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and determine the proportion of anti-Spike antibodies that block interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. In this approach based on the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), we present natively folded viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing antigens via avidin-biotin interactions. Sera are then competed with soluble ACE2-Fc, or with a higher-affinity variant thereof, to determine the proportion of ACE2 blocking anti-RBD antibodies. Assessment of sera from 144 SARS-CoV-2 patients ultimately revealed that a remarkably consistent and high proportion of antibodies in the anti-RBD pool targeted the epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement (83%  11%; 50% to 107% signal inhibition in our largest cohort), further underscoring the importance of tailoring vaccines to promote the development of such antibodies. IMPORTANCE With the emergence and continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and of the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an urgent need for improved understanding of how the body mounts an immune response to the virus. Here, we developed a competitive SARS-CoV-2 serological assay that can simultaneously determine whether an individual has developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and measure the proportion of these antibodies that block interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. Using this assay and 144 SARS-CoV-2 patient serum samples, we found that a majority of anti-RBD antibodies compete for ACE2 binding. These results not only highlight the need to design vaccines to generate such blocking antibodies but also demonstrate the utility of this assay to rapidly screen patient sera for potentially neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Competitive SARS-CoV-2 Serology Reveals Most Antibodies Targeting the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain Compete for ACE2 Binding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What happens when, in a nation under lockdown, teaching moves online?

The effectiveness of vaccines in settings with widespread Gamma variant transmission has not been reported. Methods We performed a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of an inactivated vaccine, CoronaVac, in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Manaus, where the Gamma variant accounted for 86% of genotyped SARS-CoV-2 samples at the peak of its epidemic. We performed an early analysis of effectiveness following administration of at least one vaccine dose and an analysis of effectiveness of the two-dose schedule. The primary outcome was symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings For the early at-least-one-dose and two-dose analyses the study population was, respectively, 53,176 and 53,153 HCWs residing in Manaus and aged 18 years or older, with complete information on age, residence, and vaccination status. Among 53,153 HCWs eligible for the two-dose analysis, 47,170 (89%) received at least one dose of CoronaVac and 2,656 individuals (5%) underwent RT-PCR testing from 19 January, 2021 to 13 April, 2021. Of 3,195 RT-PCR tests, 885 (28%) were positive. 393 and 418 case-control pairs were selected for the early and two-dose analyses, respectively, matched on calendar time, age, and neighbourhood. Among those who had received both vaccine doses before the RT-PCR sample collection date, the average time from second dose to sample collection date was 14 days (IQR 7-24). In the early analysis, vaccination with at least one dose was associated with a 0.50-fold reduction (adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE), 49.6%, 95% CI 11.3 to 71.4) in the odds of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period 14 days or more after receiving the first dose. However, we estimated low effectiveness (adjusted VE 36.8%, 95% CI -54.9 to 74.2) of the two-dose schedule against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period 14 days or more after receiving the second dose. A finding that vaccinated individuals were much more likely to be infected than unvaccinated individuals in the period 0-13 days after first dose (aOR 2.11, 95% CI 1.36-3.27) suggests that unmeasured confounding led to downward bias in the vaccine effectiveness estimate. Interpretation Evidence from this test-negative study of the effectiveness of CoronaVac was mixed, and likely affected by bias in this setting. Administration of at least one vaccine dose showed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of epidemic Gamma variant transmission. However, the low estimated effectiveness of the two-dose schedule underscores the need to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions while vaccination campaigns with CoronaVac are being implemented.

IBS is an important health care issue because it negatively affects the quality of life of patients and places a considerable financial burden on health care systems. Despite extensive research, the etiology and underlying pathophysiology of IBS remain incompletely understood. Proposed mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis include increased intestinal permeability, changes in the immune system, visceral hypersensitivity, impaired gut motility, and emotional disorders. Recently, accumulating evidence has highlighted the important role of the gut microbiota in the development of IBS. Microbial dysbiosis within the gut is thought to contribute to all aspects of its multifactorial pathogenesis. The last few decades have also seen an increasing interest in the impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiota. Moreover, antibiotics have been suggested to play a role in the development of IBS. Extensive research has established that antibacterial therapy induces remarkable shifts in the bacterial community composition that are quite similar to those observed in IBS. This suggestion is further supported by data from cohort and case-control studies, indicating that antibiotic treatment is associated with an increased risk of IBS.

The purpose of this study was to examine these factors in relation to ocurrence of depression and anxiety after the first outbreak in Spain. METHODS We contacted 9515 participants from a population-based cohort study in Catalonia between May and October 2020. We drew blood samples to establish infection to the virus. Pre-pandemic mental health conditions were confirmed through Electronic Health Registries. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess severe depression and anxiety post-pandemic. Exposure to proximal, financial and wider environment stressors during the lockdown were collected. We calculated Relative Risks (RR), adjusting for individual- and contextual covariates. RESULTS Pre-pandemic mental health disorders were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection , but were associated with severity of COVID-19 disease. People with pre-existing mental health disorders showed higher prevalence of severe depression (25.4%) and anxiety (37.8%) than those without prior mental disorders (4.9% and 10.1%). Living alone was a strong predictor of severe depression among mental health patients (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2). Among those without prior mental health disorders, post-lockdown depression and anxiety were associated with household interpersonal conflicts (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 2.1-3.1; RR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.9-2.4) and financial instability (RR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.9; 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.2).

DESIGN Systematic review of observational studies. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, Embase and Swemed+ were searched through October 2018. Reference lists in included studies were hand searched for potential relevant studies. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included observational studies, published 1990 or later as full-text empirical articles in peer-reviewed journals in English or a Scandinavian language, containing one or more statistical tests regarding a relationship between a measure of alcohol consumption and a measure of work performance. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data. Tested associations between alcohol consumption and work performance within the included studies were quality assessed and analysed with frequency tables, cross-tabulations and 2 tests of independence. RESULTS Twenty-six studies were included, containing 132 tested associations. The vast majority of associations (77%) indicated that higher levels of alcohol consumption were associated with higher levels of impaired work performance, and these positive associations were considerably more likely than negative associations to be statistically significant (OR=14.00, phi=0.37, p<0.001). Alcohol exposure measured by hangover episodes and composite instruments were over-represented among significant positive associations of moderate and high quality (15 of 17 associations). Overall, 61% of the associations were characterised by low quality. CONCLUSIONS Evidence does provide some support for the notion of alcohol-related presenteeism. However, due to low research quality and lack of longitudinal designs, evidence should be characterised as somewhat inconclusive. More robust and less heterogeneous research is warranted. This review, however, does provide support for targeting alcohol consumption within the frame of workplace interventions aimed at improving employee health and productivity.

PURPOSE: In a recent issue published in the European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al. published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages. In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital. METHODS: 8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning. They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded. RESULTS: Two patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days. A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation. CONCLUSION: In our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers. The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients. Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.","output":"Indications and timing for tracheostomy in patients with SARS CoV2-related"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart attacks, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy are all linked to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

GMVs can increase access to integrative care while providing additional benefits including increased clinician-patient contact time, cost savings, and support with prevention and self-management of chronic conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical sites are experimenting with new models of care delivery including virtual GMVs using telehealth. Little research has focused on which clinicians offer this type of care, how the GMV approach affects the ways they practice, and their job satisfaction. Workplace-based interventions have been shown to decrease burnout in individual physicians. We argue that more research is needed to understand if GMVs should be considered among these workplace-based interventions, given their potential benefits to clinician wellbeing. GMVs can benefit clinician wellbeing in multiple ways, including: (1) Extended time with patients; (2) Increased ability to provide team-based care; (3) Understanding patients social context and addressing social determinants of health. GMVs can be implemented in a variety of settings in many different ways depending on institutional context, patient needs and clinician preferences. We suggest that GMV programs with adequate institutional support may be beneficial for preventing burnout and improving retention among clinicians and health care teams more broadly, including in integrative health care.

New SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) are emerging all over the world, with the threat of being more readily transmitted, being more virulent, or escaping naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. At least three major prototypic VoC have been identified, i.e. the United Kingdom, UK (B.1.1.7), South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (B.1.1.28.1) variants. These are replacing formerly dominant strains and sparking new COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS: We studied the effect of infection with prototypic VoC from both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in female Syrian golden hamsters to assess their relative infectivity and virulence in direct comparison to two basal SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in early 2020. FINDINGS: A very efficient infection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters by these VoC is observed. In line with clinical evidence from patients infected with these VoC, no major differences in disease outcome were observed as compared to the original strains as was quantified by (i) histological scoring, (ii) micro-computed tomography, and (iii) analysis of the expression profiles of selected antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Noteworthy however, in hamsters infected with VoC B.1.1.7, a particularly strong elevation of proinflammatory cytokines was detected.

Yet, the mechanisms are unclear and biomarkers are limited. Early in the pandemic, we observed markedly elevated factor V activity in a patient with COVID-19, which led us to measure factor V, VIII, and X activity in a cohort of 102 consecutive inpatients with COVID-19. Contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2-negative controls (n = 17) and historical pre-pandemic controls (n = 260-478) were also analyzed. This cohort represents severe COVID-19 with high rates of ventilator use (92%), line clots (47%), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) (23%), and mortality (22%). Factor V activity was significantly elevated in COVID-19 (median 150 IU/dL, range 34-248 IU/dL) compared to contemporaneous controls (median 105 IU/dL, range 22-161 IU/dL) (P < .001)-the strongest association with COVID-19 of any parameter studied, including factor VIII, fibrinogen, and D-dimer.

To correlate measurements from UTE-MRI with endotracheal-tube (ETT)-sizing and to investigate whether SGS causes change in airway dynamics. STUDY DESIGN: Animal research study. METHODS: Eight adult New-Zealand white rabbits were used as they approximate neonatal airway-size. The airways were measured using ETT-sizing and 3D UTE-MRI at baseline, 2 weeks post-cauterization induced SGS injury, and post-balloon dilation treatment. UTE-MR images were acquired to determine airway anatomy and motion. Airways were segmented from MR images. Cross-sectional area (CSA), major and minor diameters (Dmajor and Dminor ), and eccentricity were measured. RESULTS: Post-injury CSA at SGS was significantly reduced (mean 38%) compared to baseline (P = .003) using UTE-MRI. ETT-sizing correlated significantly with MRI-measured CSA at the SGS location (r = 0.6; P < .01), particularly at the post-injury timepoint (r = 0.93; P < .01). Outer diameter from ETT-sizing (OD) correlated significantly with Dmajor (r = 0.63; P < .01) from UTE-MRI at the SGS location, especially for the post-injury timepoint (r = 0.91; P < .01). Mean CSA of upper trachea did not change significantly between end-expiration and end-inspiration at any timepoint (all P > .05). Eccentricity of the upper trachea increased significantly post-balloon dilation (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: UTE-MRI successfully detected SGS and treatment response in the rabbit model, with good correlation to ETT-sizing. Balloon dilation increased CSA at SGS, but not to baseline values. SGS did not alter dynamic motion for the trachea in this rabbit model; however, tracheas were significantly eccentric post-balloon dilation. UTE-MRI can detect SGS without sedation or ionizing radiation and may be a non-invasive alternative to ETT-sizing.

These Fc receptor-dependent antibody functions provide a direct link between the innate and adaptive immune systems by combining the potent antiviral activity of innate effector cells with the diversity and specificity of the adaptive humoral response. The Fc receptor-dependent function of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) provides mechanisms for clearance of virus and virus-infected cells, as well as for stimulation of downstream adaptive immune responses by facilitating antigen presentation, or by stimulating the secretion of inflammatory mediators. In this review, we discuss the properties of Fc receptors, antibodies, and effector cells that influence ADCP.

These autoAb bound mainly to N- and C-terminal FAH peptides, the most reactive sequences being 1C50 and 390C420, respectively. Surprisingly, although FAH sequence 1C50 shares a high degree of homology with various MHV proteins, the C-terminal portion does not. Moreover, whereas the autoAb reacted with homologous peptides surrounding residues 70, 160 and 360, non-similar sequences around residues 130, 210, 240, 250, and 300 were also recognized, indicating that autoAb were not restricted to epitopes with sequence homologies. There was also a lack of correlation between the amount of anti-MHV or anti-FAH antibodies produced and the reactivity towards the peptides. Moreover, the spectrum of peptides recognized by the autoAb of a given mouse did not change significantly with time, which suggests that the MHV-elicited autoimmune response does not induce an epitope recognition spreading. Finally, anti-FAH Ab produced after immunization with rat liver FAH recognized essentially the same mouse FAH regions than autoAb from MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that the induction of the autoAb is not only related to molecular or structural mimicry, but rather supports the Danger model, in which any aggression, in this case the MHV infection, is susceptible to trigger the production of autoAb.","output":"The peptide specificities of the autoantibodies elicited by mouse hepatitis virus A59"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This study examined anxiety and coping responses to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong.

The new scenario was managed by following international recommendations and considering the pandemic in a context of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), allowing rapid measures to be taken. These aimed to: ensure donor safety, promote proper responses to patients' needs, ensure the health and well-being of personnel, and prepare for future scenarios. RESULTS: The BST has adapted its activities to the changes in demand. No shortage of any product or service occurred. Donor acceptance, safety and wellbeing were maintained except for tissue donation, which almost completely stopped. To support the health system, several activities have been promoted: large-scale convalescent plasma (CP) production, clinical trials with CP and mesenchymal stromal cells, massive COVID-19 diagnoses, and participation in co-operative research and publications. Haemovigilance is running smoothly and no adverse effects have been detected among donors or patients. DISCUSSION: Several elements have proven to be critical when addressing the pandemic scenario: a) the early creation of a crisis committee in combination with technical recommendations and the recognition of a VUCA scenario; b) identification of the strategies described; c) the integrated donor-to-patient organisational model; d) active Research and Development (R&D); and e) the flexibility of the staff. It is essential to underline the importance of the need for centralised management, effective contingency strategies, and early collaboration with peers.","output":"SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic: first wave, impact, response and lessons learnt in a fully integrated Regional Blood and Tissue Bank.

Using a cross-sectional, anonymous survey, we examined patterns of naturalistic CBD use among individuals with fibromyalgia (FM) and other chronic pain conditions. Our objective was to better understand rates of CBD use, reasons for use and discontinuation, communication with healthcare professionals about CBD, and perceptions of CBD effectiveness and safety among people with FM. After excluding incomplete surveys, our study population consisted of Na?=a?2,701 participants with fibromyalgia, primarily in the United States. Overall, 38.1% reported never using CBD, 29.4% reported past CBD use, and 32.4% reported current CBD use. Past-year cannabis use was strongly associated with past or current CBD use. Those using CBD typically did so due to inadequate symptom relief, while those not using CBD typically cited safety concerns as their reason for not using CBD. Two-thirds of participants disclosed CBD use to their physician, although only 33% asked for physician advice on using CBD. Participants used CBD for numerous FM-related symptoms (most commonly pain), and generally reported slight to much improvement across symptom domains. Around half of participants reported side effects, which were typically minor. Our findings are limited by selection bias and our cross-sectional design, which prevents causal associations. In conclusion, CBD use is common among individuals with FM and many individuals using CBD report improvements across numerous FM-related symptoms. Our findings highlight the need for additional rigorous studies to better understand CBD's potential for FM management. PERSPECTIVE: This article indicates that CBD use is common among people with fibromyalgia, and the results suggest that many derive benefit from using CBD across multiple symptoms domains. Clinicians should discuss CBD use with fibromyalgia patients, and future studies are needed to rigorously assess CBD's therapeutic value for fibromyalgia symptoms.","output":"Cannabidiol Use for Fibromyalgia: Prevalence of Use and Perceptions of Effectiveness in a Large Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wildlife respond to human presence by adjusting their temporal niche, possibly modifying encounter rates among species and trophic dynamics that structure communities. We assessed wildlife diel activity responses to human presence and consequential changes in predator-prey overlap using 11,111 detections of 3 large carnivores and 11 ungulates across 21,430 camera trap-nights in West Africa. Over two-thirds of species exhibited diel responses to mainly diurnal human presence, with ungulate nocturnal activity increasing by 7.1%. Rather than traditional pairwise predator-prey diel comparisons, we considered spatiotemporally explicit predator access to several prey resources to evaluate community-level trophic responses to human presence. Although leopard prey access was not affected by humans, lion and spotted hyena access to three prey species significantly increased when prey increased their nocturnal activity to avoid humans.

However, the roles of liver cellular clusters and intercellular communication in the progression of endotoxemia have not been well-characterized. METHODS Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was performed, and the transcriptomes of 19,795 single liver cells from healthy and endotoxic mice were profiled. The spatial and temporal changes in hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cell types were validated by multiplex immunofluorescence staining, bulk transcriptomic sequencing, or flow cytometry. Furthermore, we used an adeno-associated virus delivery system to confirm the major mechanisms mediating myeloid cell infiltration and T cell suppression in septic murine liver. RESULTS We identified a proinflammatory hepatocyte (PIH) subpopulation that developed primarily from periportal hepatocytes and to a lesser extent from pericentral hepatocytes and played key immunoregulatory roles in endotoxemia. Multicellular cluster modeling of ligand-receptor interactions revealed that PIHs play a crucial role in the recruitment of macrophages via the CCL2-CCR2 interaction. Recruited macrophages (RMs) released cytokines (e.g., IL6, TNF, and IL17) to induce the expression of inhibitory ligands, such as PD-L1, on hepatocytes. Subsequently, RM-stimulated hepatocytes led to the suppression of CD4+ and memory T cell subsets partly via the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in endotoxemia. Furthermore, sinusoidal endothelial cells expressed the highest levels of proapoptotic and inflammatory genes around the periportal zone. This pattern of gene expression facilitated increases in the number of fenestrations and infiltration of immune cells in the periportal zone. CONCLUSIONS Our study elucidates unanticipated aspects of the cellular and molecular effects on liver cells in endotoxemia at the single-cell level and provides a conceptual framework for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for acute infection. LAY SUMMARY The liver plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune defense during acute systemic infections. We identified a proinflammatory hepatocyte subpopulation, and the interactions of this subpopulation with RMs via CCL2-CCR2 signaling and CD4+ T cells via the PD1-PD-L1 pathway have pivotal roles in the immune response during endotoxemia.

Patients We implemented our testing protocol on patients undergoing fetal intervention at our institution between March 1st and May 15th 2020 and we compared to same period a year before. A total of 17 pregnant patients with anomalous fetuses who met criteria for fetal intervention were included; 8 from 2019 and 9 from 2020. Methods Our testing protocol was designed based on our institutional perinatal guidelines, surgical requirements from Infection prevention and control (IPAC) committee and input from our fetal surgery team; with focus on urgency of procedure and maternal SARS-CoV-2 screening status. We compared the indications, types of procedures, maternal age, gestational age at procedure, type of anesthesia used and duration of procedure for cases performed at our institution between March 1st, 2020 to May 15th, 2020 and the same period in 2019.

We studied whether use of NSAIDs was associated with adverse outcomes and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using Danish administrative and health registries. We included individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period 27 February 2020 to 29 April 2020. NSAID users (defined as individuals having filled a prescription for NSAIDs up to 30 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test) were matched to up to 4 non-users on calendar week of the test date and propensity scores based on age, sex, relevant comorbidities, and use of selected prescription drugs. The main outcome was 30-day mortality, and NSAID users were compared to non-users using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and acute renal replacement therapy. A total of 9,236 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive individuals were eligible for inclusion. The median age in the study cohort was 50 years, and 58% were female. Of these, 248 (2.7%) had filled a prescription for NSAIDs, and 535 (5.8%) died within 30 days. In the matched analyses, treatment with NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82, p = 0.95; RD 0.1%, 95% CI -3.5% to 3.7%, p = 0.95), risk of hospitalization (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53, p = 0.31; RD 3.3%, 95% CI -3.4% to 10%, p = 0.33), ICU admission (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.02, p = 0.90; RD 0.2%, 95% CI -3.0% to 3.4%, p = 0.90), mechanical ventilation (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.30, p = 0.72; RD 0.5%, 95% CI -2.5% to 3.6%, p = 0.73), or renal replacement therapy (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.09, p = 0.81; RD -0.2%, 95% CI -2.0% to 1.6%, p = 0.81). The main limitations of the study are possible exposure misclassification, as not all individuals who fill an NSAID prescription use the drug continuously, and possible residual confounding by indication, as NSAIDs may generally be prescribed to healthier individuals due to their side effects, but on the other hand may also be prescribed for early symptoms of severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy in Danish individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The aims of the study was to evaluate glycemic control between Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) and Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) system in children and adolescent with T1D during the lockdown. Methods: This single-center analysis included 168 patients with T1D, using MDI or HCL system MiniMed 670G (Medtronic, Northridge, USA) at least 3 months before the study. Glycemic control from face-to-face visits, three months before lockdown were analyzed and compared to face to face or remote visits during the lockdown of 3 months. Data was collected through the electronic medical record system and reports generated by Carelink Therapy Management Software.

However, a pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote ?1 PRF. hTPK-DU177, a pseudoknot derived from human telomerase RNA, shares structural similarities with several ?1 PRF pseudoknots and is used to dissect the roles of distinct structural features in the stimulator of ?1 PRF. Structure-based mutagenesis on hTPK-DU177 reveals that the ?1 PRF efficiency of this stimulator can be modulated by sequential removal of baseCtriple interactions surrounding the helical junction. Further analysis of the junction-flanking base triples indicates that specific stemCloop interactions and their relative positions to the helical junction play crucial roles for the ?1 PRF activity of this pseudoknot. Intriguingly, a bimolecular pseudoknot approach based on hTPK-DU177 reveals that continuing triplex structure spanning the helical junction, lacking one of the loop-closure features embedded in pseudoknot topology, can stimulate ?1 PRF. Therefore, the triplex structure is an essential determinant for the DU177 pseudoknot to stimulate ?1 PRF. Furthermore, it suggests that ?1 PRF, induced by an in-trans RNA via specific baseCtriple interactions with messenger RNAs, can be a plausible regulatory function for non-coding RNAs.","output":"An intermolecular RNA triplex provides insight into structural determinants for the pseudoknot stimulator of ?1 ribosomal frameshifting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the public health challenges posed by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic is the management of patients with chronic neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis.

Subsequently, the patient was readmitted twice in the next month for complications arising from worsening dysphagia, musculoskeletal weakness, and neurogenic bladder. On the first of these re\\\\admissions, the patient presented with altered mental status, secondary to uremic encephalopathy due to acute kidney injury precipitated by lack of adequate PO hydration. This admission was complicated by multiple pulmonary emboli necessitating transfer from the floor to the ICU, in addition to central line placement, candidemia, Pseudomonas urinary tract infection, and hemorrhagic cystitis. Despite this protracted course, the patient's mental function and orientation slowly improved as his renal function improved secondary to intravenous fluid administration. Because the patient's worsening dysphagia and weakness made adequate hydration by mouth untenable, the possibility of PEG tube placement was broached with the patient and his family. After consent was obtained, a PEG tube was placed, and the patient was subsequently discharged home under the care of his family. Two days after discharge, however, the patient presented to the Emergency Department, again with altered mental status due to uremic encephalopathy secondary to dehydration. During this admission, blood cultures also revealed Pseudomonal sepsis, likely secondary to recurrent UTI ultimately caused by neurogenic bladder.

Invasion into the diaphragm is considered a contraindication to the laparoscopic approach. At their institution, the authors have begun approaching all tumors laparoscopically. This report presents the techniques necessary to perform right hepatectomy, partial diaphragm resection, and repair using totally laparoscopic techniques. METHODS Five trocars are placed in a semilunar fashion approximately one handbreadth apart along a line one handbreadth below the right subcostal margin. The hepatic inflow is taken extraparenchymally before transection of the hepatic parenchyma in an anterior-to-posterior fashion. The hepatic inflow then is transected, and the involved portion of diaphragm is transected with ultrasonic shears. Next, the diaphragm is repaired primarily and buttressed with an absorbable material to decrease the incidence of recurrent diaphragmatic hernia. RESULTS Laparoscopic treatment was attempted for ten patients and successfully completed for nine of these patients (90%). All 10 patients had secondary liver tumors. Three patients required concomitant partial diaphragm resection. The median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 500 ml (range, 300-3,000 ml). All margins were negative, and the average hospital stay was 8 days (range, 5-17 days). Two patients (20%) experienced complications, which consisted of biliary leaks, which were treated with percutaneous drainage. One of these patients underwent conversion to an open procedure due to an inferior vena cava injury. No mortality occurred at 30 or 90 days of follow-up evaluation.

The decrease in lumbar bone mineral density was particularly evident when the body mass index was low, there were previous vertebral fractures, or lumbar bone mineral density before denosumab administration was low. INTRODUCTION: Selective estrogen receptor modulators may be an alternative to bisphosphonates for treating rebound resorption after discontinuing denosumab. This study aimed to investigate the effects of follow-up raloxifene therapy after denosumab discontinuation in postmenopausal women. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 61 patients who received 12-month follow-up raloxifene therapy after denosumab discontinuation. The primary endpoint was the bone mineral density change. The secondary endpoints were the changes in bone turnover markers and the incidence of new vertebral fractures. RESULTS: Raloxifene administration for 12 months after denosumab discontinuation resulted in a significantly lower bone mineral density at all sites compared to the level at 6 months after the last denosumab treatment (lumbar spine, ? 5.48%; femoral neck, ? 2.95%; total hip, ? 3.52%; all, p < 0.001). The decrease in lumbar bone mineral density was particularly evident when the body mass index was low, there were previous vertebral fractures, or lumbar bone mineral density before denosumab administration was low. Marked increases in the bone turnover markers from baseline were noted after switching to raloxifene. However, no new vertebral fractures occurred during raloxifene treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up raloxifene therapy after denosumab discontinuation resulted in a decrease in bone mass to the pre-denosumab levels and a rebound increase of bone turnover markers. Therefore, raloxifene administered sequentially after denosumab discontinuation was not effective in preventing rebound phenomenon.

Although privacy policies are designed to inform consumers, such policies have consistently been found to be confusing and lack transparency. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present consumer preferences for accessing privacy information; develop and apply a privacy policy risk assessment tool to assess whether existing HITs meet the recommended privacy policy standards; and propose guidelines to assist health professionals and service providers with understanding the privacy risks associated with HITs, so that they can confidently promote their safe use as a part of care. METHODS: In phase 1, participatory design workshops were conducted with young people who were attending a participating headspace center, their supportive others, and health professionals and service providers from the centers. The findings were knowledge translated to determine participant preferences for the presentation and availability of privacy information and the functionality required to support its delivery. Phase 2 included the development of the 23-item privacy policy risk assessment tool, which incorporated material from international privacy literature and standards. This tool was then used to assess the privacy policies of 34 apps and e-tools. In phase 3, privacy guidelines, which were derived from learnings from a collaborative consultation process with key stakeholders, were developed to assist health professionals and service providers with understanding the privacy risks associated with incorporating HITs as a part of clinical care. RESULTS: When considering the use of HITs, the participatory design workshop participants indicated that they wanted privacy information to be easily accessible, transparent, and user-friendly to enable them to clearly understand what personal and health information will be collected and how these data will be shared and stored. The privacy policy review revealed consistently poor readability and transparency, which limited the utility of these documents as a source of information. Therefore, to enable informed consent, the privacy guidelines provided ensure that health professionals and consumers are fully aware of the potential for privacy risks in using HITs to support health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of transparency in privacy policies has the potential to undermine consumers ability to trust that the necessary measures are in place to secure and protect the privacy of their personal and health information, thus precluding their willingness to engage with HITs. The application of the privacy guidelines will improve the confidence of health professionals and service providers in the privacy of consumer data, thus enabling them to recommend HITs to provide or support care.","output":"Privacy Practices of Health Information Technologies: Privacy Policy Risk Assessment Study and Proposed Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thousands of volunteers are taking part in a US trial of the Oxford vaccine, raising hopes for results this year, reports Michael Le Page","output":"Vaccine trial begins in US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers launched the American Society of Hematology Research Collaborative COVID-19 Registry for Hematology in April to gather real-time data on patients with hematologic malignancies who develop COVID-19.

Despite this major dietary shift, we know relatively little about food and nutrient intake in infants worldwide and virtually nothing about the impact of baby food pouches and baby-led weaning (BLW), which are infant feeding approaches that are becoming increasingly popular. Pouches are squeezable containers with a plastic spout that have great appeal for parents, as evidenced by their extraordinary market share worldwide. BLW is an alternative approach to introducing solids that promotes infant self-feeding of whole foods rather than being fed pures, and is popular and widely advocated on social media. The nutritional and health impacts of these novel methods of infant feeding have not yet been determined. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the First Foods New Zealand study is to determine the iron status, growth, food and nutrient intakes, breast milk intake, eating and feeding behaviors, dental health, oral motor skills, and choking risk of New Zealand infants in general and those who are using pouches or BLW compared with those who are not. METHODS: Dietary intake (two 24-hour recalls supplemented with food photographs), iron status (hemoglobin, plasma ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor), weight status (BMI), food pouch use and extent of BLW (questionnaire), breast milk intake (deuterium oxide dose-to-mother technique), eating and feeding behaviors (questionnaires and video recording of an evening meal), dental health (photographs of upper and lower teeth for counting of caries and developmental defects of enamel), oral motor skills (questionnaires), and choking risk (questionnaire) will be assessed in 625 infants aged 7.0 to 9.9 months.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the immunologic mechanisms underlying allergic reactions to these vaccines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series included 22 patients with suspected allergic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines between December 18, 2020, and January 27, 2021, at a large regional health care network. Participants were individuals who received at least 1 of the following International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision anaphylaxis codes: T78.2XXA, T80.52XA, T78.2XXD, or E949.9, with documentation of COVID-19 vaccination. Suspected allergy cases were identified and invited for follow-up allergy testing. EXPOSURES: FDA-authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Allergic reactions were graded using standard definitions, including Brighton criteria.

This research provides a detailed characterization of the sensing surface and immunochemistry. The results show that SLOCK has good sensitivity to IL-31 concentrations in synthetic and human sweat. The limit of detection is 50 and 100 pg/mL for synthetic and human sweat, respectively. The dynamic range of the system is 50C1000 pg/mL, which encompasses the physiological ranges of 150C620 pg/mL. This is the first demonstration of sweat-based, label-free, electrochemical detection of IL-31. In addition to this, the data show good correlation (R(2) > 0.95) for the signal sensitivity to biomarker concentration. Finally, cross-reactivity studies highlight the specificity of SLOCK even in the presence of highly cross-reactive species. Thus, this novel SLOCK biosensor can be successfully used to track IL-31 in a sensitive and noninvasive manner and could be used to identify chronic pathophysiologies present in the body.","output":"Tuning SLOCK toward Chronic Disease Diagnostics and Management: Label-free Sweat Interleukin-31 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data regarding the immunological memory and long\\\\time kinetics of immunoglobulin (IgG) against viral nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein S1 receptor\\\\binding domain (S1RBD) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\\\\associated Coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) are lacking.

Foam sclerotherapy was performed with 1-3%sodium-tetra-decyl-sulphatefoam (Tessaris method). We evaluated the possible risks of the procedure and methods to resolve them. We compared the costs of both procedures performed in the operating room and in the outpatient clinic. RESULTS: We had complete occlusion of the GSV in 28/30 patients (93.3%). Periodic check-up revealed a reflux through an anterior lateral saphenous vein in one patient and a long saphenous stump in another patient. There were no severe intraoperative complications. In two cases, it was necessary to convert the radiofrequency procedure into foam sclerotherapy (using the hollow probe as a long catheter in one case and using needle injection in the second case). In another case, it was necessary to perform surgical cannulation of the GSV. There were no severe postoperative complications. Moreover, the cost of the operating room procedure was  1226.50, while that of the outpatient clinic procedure was  1082.65 (cost reduction, 12.5%).

However, little attention has been given to the follow-up of recovered patients, and there is no environmental evidence to determine whether these patients continue to shed the virus after they test negative. Therefore, with an objective to test the hypothesis of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to 1) determine whether SARS-CoV-2 particles are present in the indoor air and 2) determine whether recovered patients are still shedding virus, thus providing much-needed environmental evidence for the management of COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. In this study, surface and air samples were collected from an intensive care unit (ICU) containing one ready-for-discharge patient. All surface samples tested negative, but the air samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This implies that SARS-CoV-2 particles may be shed in aerosol form for days after patients test negative.

This study examined the impact of COVID-19 response measures on changes in violence against women and children (VAWC) service utilisation across European countries. METHODS: A rapid assessment design was used to compile data including a survey distributed across WHO Europe Healthy Cities Networks and Violence Injury Prevention Focal Points in WHO European Region member states, and a scoping review of media reports, journal articles, and reports. Searches were conducted in English and Russian and covered the period between 1 January 2020 and 17 September 2020. Data extracted included: country; violence type; service sector; and change in service utilisation during COVID-19. All data pertained to the period during which COVID-19 related public health measures were implemented compared to a period before restrictions were in place. RESULTS: Overall, findings suggested that there was a median reported increase in VAWC service utilisation of approximately 20% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Crucially, however, change in service utilisation differed across sectors. After categorising each estimate as reflecting an increase or decrease in VAWC service utilisation, there was a significant association between sector and change in service utilisation; the majority of NGO estimates (95.1%) showed an increase in utilisation, compared to 58.2% of law enforcement estimates and 42.9% of health and social care estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The variation across sectors in changes in VAWC service utilisation has important implications for policymakers in the event of ongoing and future restrictions related to COVID-19, and more generally during other times of prolonged presence in the home. The increased global attention on VAWC during the pandemic should be used to drive forward the agenda on prevention, increase access to services, and implement better data collection mechanisms to ensure the momentum and increased focus on VAWC during the pandemic is not wasted.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to objectively analyze the literature over the last 5 years for empirical evidence of burnout incident to the EHR and to identify barriers to, facilitators to, and associated patient satisfaction with using the EHR to improve symptoms of burnout. METHODS: No human participants were involved in this review; however, 100% of participants in studies analyzed were adult physicians. We queried 4 research databases and 1 targeted journal for studies commensurate with the objective statement from January 1, 2016 through January 31, 2021 (n=25). RESULTS: The hours spent in documentation and workflow are responsible for the sense of loss of autonomy, lack of work-life balance, lack of control of ones schedule, cognitive fatigue, a general loss of autonomy, and poor relationships with colleagues. Researchers have identified training, local customization of templates and workflow, and the use of scribes as strategies to alleviate the administrative burden of the EHR and decrease symptoms of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The solutions provided in the literature only addressed 2 of the 3 factors (workflow and documentation time) but not the third factor (usability). Practitioners and administrators should focus on the former 2 factors because they are within their sphere of control.

Because eukaryal genomes are liberally interspersed with transcription units specifying long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, there are many opportunities for lncRNA synthesis to negatively affect a neighboring protein-coding gene. Here, I review two eukaryal systems in which lncRNA interference with mRNA expression underlies a regulated biological response to nutrient availability. Budding yeast SER3 is repressed under serine-replete conditions by transcription of an upstream SRG1 lncRNA that traverses the SER3 promoter and elicits occlusive nucleosome rearrangements. SER3 is de-repressed by serine withdrawal, which leads to shut-off of SRG1 synthesis. The fission yeast phosphate homeostasis (PHO) regulon comprises three phosphate acquisition genes - pho1, pho84, and tgp1 - that are repressed under phosphate-replete conditions by 5' flanking lncRNAs prt, prt2, and nc-tgp1, respectively. lncRNA transcription across the PHO mRNA promoters displaces activating transcription factor Pho7. PHO mRNAs are transcribed during phosphate starvation when lncRNA synthesis abates. The PHO regulon is de-repressed in phosphate-replete cells by genetic manipulations that favor 'precocious' lncRNA 3'-processing/termination upstream of the mRNA promoters. PHO lncRNA termination is governed by the Pol2 CTD code and is subject to metabolite control by inositol pyrophosphates.","output":"Transcriptional interference at tandem lncRNA and protein-coding genes: an emerging theme in regulation of cellular nutrient homeostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Many women who develop endometrial cancer (EC) or endometrial hyperplasia with atypia are obese and therefore at high risk of surgical complications.

Monte Carlo simulation was used to insert simulated SARS outbreaks of various sizes onto the background incidence of febrile cases, accounting for distribution of SARS incubation period, delay from onset to first consult, and likelihood of presenting with T >or=38 to the SAF medical centre. RESULTS Valid temperature data was available for 2,012 out of 2,305 eligible syndromic consults (87.2%). T >or=38 was observed in 166 consults (8.3%). Simulated outbreaks would peak 7 days after exposure, but, on average, signals at their peak would consist of 10.9% of entire outbreak size. Under baseline assumptions, the system has a higher than 90% chance of detecting an outbreak only with 20 or more cases. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance based on clusters of cases with T >or=38 helps reduce background noise in primary care data, but the major limitation of such systems is that they are still only able to confidently detect large outbreaks.","output":"Modelling the utility of body temperature readings from primary care consults for SARS surveillance in an army medical centre."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has placed extraordinary demands upon healthcare systems worldwide Italy's hospitals have been among the most severely overwhelmed, and as a result, Italian healthcare workers' (HCWs) well-being has been at risk The aim of this study is to explore the relationships between dimensions of burnout and various psychological features among Italian healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 emergency A group of 267 HCWs from a hospital in the Lazio Region completed self-administered questionnaires online through Google Forms, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Resilience Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale Short Form (IU) Cluster analysis highlighted two opposite burnout risk profiles: low burnout and high-risk burnout The high-risk group had lower resilience and greater difficulties in tolerating the uncertainty than the low-burnout group A set of general linear models confirmed that both IU subscales, prospective and inhibition, moderated the relationship between resilience and burnout (specifically in the depersonalization dimension) In conclusion, the results showed that individual levels of resilience and one's ability to tolerate uncertainty have been significant factors in determining the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on HCWs The use of emotional strategies that allow individuals to stay in a critical situation without the need to control it appears to protect against burnout in these circumstances","output":"From Resilience to Burnout in Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Emergency: The Role of the Ability to Tolerate Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections are complex processes based on an intricate network of molecular interactions. The infectious agent hijacks components of the cellular machinery for its profit, circumventing the natural defense mechanisms triggered by the infected cell. The successful completion of the replicative viral cycle within a cell depends on the function of viral components versus the cellular defenses. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important cellular modulators, either promoting or preventing the progression of viral infections. Among these ncRNAs, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) family is especially relevant due to their intrinsic functional properties and ubiquitous biological roles. Specific lncRNAs have been recently characterized as modulators of the cellular response during infection of human host cells by single stranded RNA viruses. However, the role of host lncRNAs in the infection by human RNA coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 remains uncharacterized. In the present work, we have performed a transcriptomic study of a cohort of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Our results revealed the existence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection-dependent pattern of transcriptional up-regulation in which specific lncRNAs are an integral component. To determine the role of these lncRNAs, we performed a functional correlation analysis complemented with the study of the validated interactions between lncRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). This combination of in silico functional association studies and experimental evidence allowed us to identify a lncRNA signature composed of six elements - NRIR, BISPR, MIR155HG, FMR1-IT1, USP30-AS1, and U62317.2 - associated with the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose a competition mechanism between the viral RNA genome and the regulatory lncRNAs in the sequestering of specific RBPs that modulates the interferon response and the regulation of RNA surveillance by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Graphical abstract Model of interactions among lncRNA and cognate RNA-binding proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to our model, the viral genome can establish direct interactions with three core proteins (DDX3X, UPF1 and IGF2BP2) involved in mRNA metabolism and regulation of the interferon response, which are also components of a SARS-CoV-2 lncRNA-centered regulatory network. The competition between viral RNA and lncRNAs could act as a counteracting factor for the normal function of homeostatic lncRNA-centered regulatory networks, contributing to viral progression and replication.

Considering the uncertainty of the antitumor mechanism of Echinacoside (Ech) and the fact that no study on Ech against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been explored previously, this study inquired into the anti-NSCLC effect of Ech and explored its potential mechanisms. METHODS: The IC(50) to Ech of the NSCLC cells was calculated based on a series of cell viability assays. Different concentrations of Ech were used to treat the cells; the proliferation activity of the cells was evaluated using EdU staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by JC-1 staining. Levels of cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 were measured by ELISA. GSH and MDA levels were measured by microplate reader. Expression of cytochrome c, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1, c-Myc, c-Fos, and Raf/MEK/ERK pathway proteins was evaluated by western blot. Meanwhile, we used xenograft, immunohistochemical staining, and H&E staining to evaluate the pharmacological effects of Ech in mice in vivo. RESULTS: ECH inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Ech increased the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins. Besides, Ech perturbed the mitochondrial membrane potential with the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, accompanied by increased oxidative stress. Ech inhibited the phosphorylation levels of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and subsequently reduced c-myc and c-fos protein expression. In addition, Ech effectively restrained the growth of tumors in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Ech inhibited the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. Impaired mitochondria activated inflammasome, which in turn led to the pyroptosis of NSCLC cells. These findings can provide some ideas on how to use pyroptosis to treat NSCLC.","output":"Echinacoside Induces Mitochondria-Mediated Pyroptosis through Raf/MEK/ERK Signaling in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, versatile, mechanically robust, and highly-scalable electrospun nanofibrous composite filters towards unprecedented potent antimicrobial and excellent filtering properties are successfully designed and fabricated. Experimentally, the nanofibrous polyacrylonitrile (PAN) blended with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is fabricated for the dual quality of both PANs filtering capability and PVDFs hydrophobic nature. Achieved without toxic polymer crosslinking agents or high-temperature post-treatment curing/annealing, the nanomembrane shows high water repellency, high mechanical/thermal stabilities and good spinnability. The PAN/PVDF membranes loaded with natural extract mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L., GM) and a minimum amount of in situ synthesized silver nanoparticles are first developed by needle-based electrospinning and, later, by a scalable blown electrospinning system, which applied an air-assisted technique to enhance the production rate. Our respective face masks show not only high filtering efficiency towards fine particulate matters (PMs) (93.91% for 0.5 m) and bioaerosols (bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) of 99.2% and viral filtration efficiency (VFE) of 98.3%), but also antimicrobial abilities against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative Klebsiella pneumonia, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra bacteria. Moreover, by virus inhibition assay and rRT-PCR, the nanomembrane shows a 99.94% reduction of H1N1 influenza virus. Despite this unprecedented novel multifunctionality, it is easier to breathe than commercial face masks with similar particle filtering performance.

Digital transformation is the adoption of digital technologies whereby the existing business processes are modified or new ones are created. This process of redefining the conventional procedures, culture and customer experience to meet the changing requirements benefit the overall business function. Redefining the process of business in the digital age is digital transformation. Digital transformation in Oil & Gas Industry is embracing of technology to reshape how oil and gas companies manage and operate their assets. The digitally-enabled and data-centric approach leads to improved productivity, higher efficiency and increased cost savings. One of the Process Transformation example in Oil & Gas sector is to conduct the Factory Inspection and Acceptance Tests remotely utilizing various digital tools available in this digital age instead of the conventional way of physical participation in the testing. Many industries were already exploring the possibilities of non-conventional work practices such as Work from Home (remotely, away from office), conducting virtual meetings with remotely located participants. These practices were still not accepted in all the industries prior to 2020. However the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic worldwide created a need to accept these non-conventional practices of remote or virtual work. Post Covid (2020), these are widely accepted in most of the industries including Oil & Gas sector. The concept of Virtual Remote Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) is explored to overcome the unforeseen situation arose due to worldwide Covid-19 outbreak. Travel restrictions were imposed worldwide to curb the covid-19 spread, which made a halt to the normal work practices followed till then. Virtual Remote FAT is a successful alternative to the conventional way of conducting the FAT and was utilized during Covid-19 outbreak.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This cross-sectional study was designed to collect a nationally representative sample (N=1200; age 18C65 years; estimated start/endJune/November 2021) using multistage probabilistic household sampling. Trained staff will conduct in-person diagnostic interviews. A battery of self-report instruments will be administered to assess the quality of life (QoL), general distress and associated protective and harmful psychological and societal factors. Analyses will be conducted to delineate the prevalence rates of MH disorders, how MH conditions and QoL vary with respect to sociodemographic variables, personality, health status and traumatic events during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test how these relations depend on geographical region. Moreover, this study was designed to explore mechanisms linking personality and the perception of pandemic consequences and associated distress. Prevalence rates of MH disorders will be calculated using descriptive statistics. For additional analyses, we will use correlations, analysis of variance and regression analyses. The hierarchical structure of the data will be explored using multilevel random coefficient modelling.

DESIGN Local health departments voluntarily participated weekly in a National Association of County and City Health Officials Web-based survey designed to provide situational awareness to federal partners about NPI recommendations and implementation during the response and to provide insight into the epidemiologic context in which recommendations were made. SETTING Local health departments during the fall 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. PARTICIPANTS Local health departments that voluntarily participated in the National Association of County and City Health Officials Sentinel Surveillance Network. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Local health departments were asked to report data on recommendations for and the implementation of NPIs from 7 community sectors. Data were also collected on influenza outbreaks; closures, whether recommended by the local health department or not; absenteeism of students in grades K-12; the type(s) of influenza viruses circulating in the jurisdiction; and the health care system capacity. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine LHDs participated. Most LHDs issued NPI recommendations to their community over the 10-week survey period with 70% to 97% of LHDs recommending hand hygiene and cough etiquette and 51% to 78% voluntary isolation of ill patients. However, 21% to 48% of LHDs lacked information of closure, absenteeism, or outbreaks in schools, and 28% to 50% lacked information on outpatient clinic capacity. CONCLUSIONS Many LHDs were unable to monitor implementation of NPI (recommended by LHD or not) within their community during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pathologic changes of organ systems and the clinicopathologic basis for severe and fatal outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective autopsy study. SETTING: Single pathology department. PARTICIPANTS: 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 (10 of whom were selected at random for autopsy). MEASUREMENTS: Systematic macroscopic, histopathologic, and viral analysis (SARS-CoV-2 on real-time polymerase chain reaction assay), with correlation of pathologic and clinical features, including comorbidities, comedication, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Patients' age ranged from 66 to 91 years (mean, 80.5 years; 8 men, 3 women). Ten of the 11 patients received prophylactic anticoagulant therapy; venous thromboembolism was not clinically suspected antemortem in any of the patients. Both lungs showed various stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), including edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts. Thrombosis of small and mid-sized pulmonary arteries was found in various degrees in all 11 patients and was associated with infarction in 8 patients and bronchopneumonia in 6 patients. Kupffer cell proliferation was seen in all patients, and chronic hepatic congestion in 8 patients. Other changes in the liver included hepatic steatosis, portal fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates and ductular proliferation, lobular cholestasis, and acute liver cell necrosis, together with central vein thrombosis. Additional frequent findings included renal proximal tubular injury, focal pancreatitis, adrenocortical hyperplasia, and lymphocyte depletion of spleen and lymph nodes. Viral RNA was detectable in pharyngeal, bronchial, and colonic mucosa but not bile. LIMITATION: The sample was small. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 predominantly involves the lungs, causing DAD and leading to acute respiratory insufficiency. Death may be caused by the thrombosis observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Studies are needed to further understand the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, together with the roles for strict thrombosis prophylaxis, laboratory, and imaging studies and early anticoagulant therapy for suspected pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism.

Through cooperation with experts from other institutions, the content of the questionnaire was designed to include interviewees spatial locations and individual information, identify whether negative emotions were generated, and determine the level of psychological stress and the degree of perception change, etc. According to the data type, mathematical statistics and multiple logistic regression methods were used to examine regional differentiation and influencing factors regarding the psychological stress of residents using 1668 valid questionnaires from 53 municipal administrative units in South China. The results firstly showed that over the whole area there was typical regional differentiation in South China, especially in relation to negative expression and psychological stress, with this feature reflecting the dual urbanCrural structure. Secondly, regional differences were obvious. Residents of Hainan showed stronger change of psychological stress than those of the other two provinces. In contrast, Guangdong residents were the least psychological stress, and the concept of a harmonious relationship between human beings and nature was not accepted as well as in the other two provinces. Thirdly, in each province the capital city acted as the regional pole, with greater psychological status. This polarization effect decreased with greater distance, reflecting the theory of growth poles in human geography.

Though COVID-19-induced lockdown led to a decline in trade with China, it recovered quickly in subsequent months. In the case of India, even after imposing restrictive measures, trade with China was found to bounce back indicating to a greater dependence on China. Further, asymmetry in economic engagement with China could be observed for several of the South Asian nations. Chinese investment in the region remained muted during the pandemic.

We aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the care continuum of HCV-infected patients. Methods: 256 Patients who were prescribed a course of DAA therapy at three tertiary medical centers in the US and China between January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 were included. We assessed the proportions of patients who completed DAA therapy and had HCV RNA testing during and after the end of therapy. We also assessed the impact of utilization of telemedicine. Results: The proportion of patients undergoing HCV RNA testing during DAA treatment decreased from >81.7% before pandemic to 67.8% during the pandemic (P=0.006), with a more prominent decrease in the US. There were significant decreases in HCV RNA testing >12 (P<0.001) and >20 weeks (P<0.001) post-treatment during COVID-19 era. Compared to pre-COVID period, post-treatment clinic encounters during COVID-19 era decreased significantly in China (Xi'an: 13.6% to 7.4%; Nanjing: 16.7% to 12.5%) but increased in the US (12.5% to 16.7%), mainly due to the use of telemedicine. There was a 4-fold increase in utilization of telemedicine in the US. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic carried profound impact on care for HCV patients in both the US and China.

This study aims to quantify pneumonia lesions by computed tomography (CT) in the early days to predict progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, representing the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV) in both lungs. CT features, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and d-dimer, on day 0 (hospital admission) and day 4, were collected to predict the occurrence of severe illness within a 28-day follow-up using both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We included 134 patients, of whom 19 (14.2%) developed any severe illness. CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, showed predictive capability. Changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed the best in the prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87~0.99; C-index=0.88, 95% CI 0.81~0.95).

With a semi-representative survey in Mexico (N = 1211), this study analyzes a mediational process to determine the impact of the use of traditional and social media on compliance with contagion prevention measures, through the perception of veracity of fake news about COVID-19. As anticipated, results indicate that believing fake news leads to less compliance of preventive measures. Likewise, the analysis indicates that, consistent with our hypothesis, using social media leads to more belief in fake news, but contrary to our expectations, consuming traditional media also leads to a greater belief in fake news. In particular, the study explored the mediating role of belief in fake news on the effect that using traditional and social media has on compliance with preventive measures. We found evidence for this indirect effect: use of traditional and social media is a predictor of believing fake news about COVID-19, which then results in lower compliance with measures. In contrast, the direct effect of using traditional and social media on compliance with measures has a positive direction. Thus, this work evinces that fake news can hinder the resolution of the health crisis, by discouraging compliance with preventive strategies.","output":"The role of believing fake news on compliance of anti-COVID-19 measures in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

A video-observed therapy (VOT) system, or more specifically, the Thai VOT (TH VOT) system, was developed to replace directly observed therapy. According to the pilot study, the system needed notifications to improve usability and user compliance. The updated version of the TH VOT system thus enabled LINE (Line Corporation) notifications. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to reassess users compliance with and the usability of the updated TH VOT system. METHODS: This study was conducted in the Hat Yai and Mueang Songkhla districts in Songkhla Province, Southern Thailand, from September 18 to December 1, 2021. The system was used by not only patients with tuberculosis but also tuberculosis staff, who acted as observers in primary health care settings. Some of the observers used the simulated VOT system instead of the actual system due to the lack of participating patients in their jurisdiction. After 30 days of using the system, VOT session records were analyzed to determine the compliance of the patients and observers. The User Experience Questionnaire was administered to reassess the usability of the system and compare the ratings of the participants with the general benchmark scores of the User Experience Questionnaire. The results were summarized to reveal the degree of user compliance and usability in the following three groups: the patients, actual VOT observers, and simulated VOT observers. RESULTS: Of the 19 observers, 10 used the actual VOT system, and the remaining 9 used the simulated VOT system; there were also 10 patients with tuberculosis. The patients, actual VOT observers, and simulated VOT observers exhibited about 70%, 65%, and 50% compliance, respectively, in terms of following the standard operating procedures every day. The scores of all groups on all dimensions were well above the average scores. There was no significant difference in any of the dimensional scores among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The updated version of the TH VOT system was deemed usable by both the patients and the health care staff.

The synaptic mechanisms underlying this variability are poorly understood. We show that synaptic noise, in conjunction with weak feedforward excitation, generates variable motor output in the Aplysia feeding system. A command-like neuron (CBI-10) triggers rhythmic motor programs more variable than programs triggered by CBI-2. CBI-10 weakly excites a pivotal pattern-generating interneuron (B34) strongly activated by CBI-2. The activation properties of B34 substantially account for the degree of program variability. CBI-10- and CBI-2-induced EPSPs in B34 vary in amplitude across trials, suggesting that there is synaptic noise. Computational studies show that synaptic noise is required for program variability. Further, at network state transition points when synaptic conductance is low, maximum program variability is promoted by moderate noise levels. Thus, synaptic strength and noise act together in a nonlinear manner to determine the degree of variability within a feedforward network.","output":"Synaptic mechanisms for motor variability in a feedforward network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optimize the scheduling problem of family nursing staff according to the actual needs of the customers, combined with the psychological behavior characteristics of the participants, and use the path heuristic algorithm on home nursing service institutions, full-time nursing staff, and nursing customers.

Pre-authorization clinical trials were carried out and the safety of vaccines is still continuously monitored through post-commercialization surveillance. However, some people are afraid of vaccine side effects, claiming they could lead to death, and hesitate to get vaccinated. Herein, a literature review of COVID-19-vaccine-related deaths has been carried out according to the PRISMA standards to understand if there is a causal relationship between vaccination and death and to highlight the real extent of such events. There have been 55 cases of death after COVID-19 vaccination reported and a causal relationship has been excluded in 17 cases. In the remaining cases, the causal link between the vaccine and the death was not specified (8) or considered possible (15), probable (1), or very probable/demonstrated (14). The causes of deaths among these cases were: vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) (32), myocarditis (3), ADEM (1), myocardial infarction (1), and rhabdomyolysis (1). In such cases, the demonstration of a causal relationship is not obvious, and more studies, especially with post-mortem investigations, are needed to deepen understanding of the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of fatal vaccine side effects.

We evaluated the differences between the virome and microbiome of UCDs and harbor seals with known causes of death. Here we determined that UCD stranded animals had no viruses in their brain tissue. However, in the bacterial community, we identified Burkholderia and Coxiella burnetii as important pathogens associated with this stranding event. Burkholderia were 100% prevalent and ~2.8 log2 fold more abundant in the UCD animals. Further, while C. burnetii was found in only 35.7% of all samples, it was highly abundant (~94% of the total microbial community) in a single individual. In this harbor seal, C. burnetii showed high transcription rates of invading and translation genes, implicating it in the pathogenesis of this animal.

ABSTRACT: The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate the impact of feeding oat on the population of bifidobacteria and (ii) evaluate their probiotic potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of supplementing sows gestation and lactation feed with 15% oat (prebiotic source) on the levels of probiotic population in milk. We found that dietary inclusion of oat during lactation and gestation resulted in increased levels of bifidobacteria compared to lactobacilli in sow milk. Furthermore bifidobacteria within the sow milk samples were further evaluated for probiotic potential based on aggregating properties, and acid- and bile-tolerance after exposure to hydrochloric acid (pH 2.5) and bile salts (0%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 1.0% and 2.0%). All isolates survived under the condition of low pH and bile 2.0%. Autoaggregation ability ranged from 17.5% to 73%. These isolates also showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7.

In this review, we summarize the roles of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of MS-PTSD and TBI-PTSD. Astrocytes synthesize and secrete neurotrophic, pro- and anti-inflammatory factors and regulate the microenvironment of the nervous tissue through metabolic pathways, ionostatic control, and homeostatic clearance of neurotransmitters.

Many VoC mutations are found in the viral spike protein (S-protein), and are thus implicated in host infection and response to therapeutics. Bivalent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are promising therapeutics for COVID-19, but are limited due to low potency and vulnerability to RBD mutations found in VoCs. To address these issues, we used na?ve phage-displayed peptide libraries to isolate and optimize 16-residue peptides that bind to the RBD or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S-protein. We fused these peptides to the N-terminus of a moderate affinity nAb to generate tetravalent peptide-IgG fusions, and showed that both classes of peptides were able to improve affinities for the S-protein trimer by >100-fold (apparent KD < 1 pM). Critically, cell-based infection assays with a panel of six SARS-CoV-2 variants demonstrate that an RBD-binding peptide was able to enhance the neutralization potency of a high-affinity nAb >100-fold. Moreover, this peptide-IgG was able to neutralize variants that were resistant to the same nAb in the bivalent IgG format. To show that this approach is general, we fused the same peptide to a clinically approved nAb drug, and showed that it rescued neutralization against a resistant variant.

Nucleic acid amplification can be a time-consuming step in NAT using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a simple method to reduce the amplification time while maintaining the PCR system. The three-step process of a general qPCR was reduced to a two-step process. The annealing/extension temperatures were increased to minimize the differences between the denaturation temperature and the annealing/extension temperatures. Subsequently, the time for each of these steps was reduced and, finally, the denaturation temperature was lowered. Taq polymerase was replaced with SD polymerase because it has strand displacement activity and is efficient in amplifying partial dsDNA at lower denaturation temperatures. In the two-step qPCR of genomic DNA using SD polymerase, the final conditions included an initial denaturation at 92 C for 2 min, and 1 s at each cycling step with a denaturation temperature of 87 C and an annealing/extension temperature of 72 C. Amplification of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus was evaluated at a template concentration as low as 10 copies.

The coronavirus pandemic is still raging on in many countries and its effects will still be felt years from now and previous studies have shown that it has impacted other mental illnesses. AN cases are on the rise and the nature of the illness has deadly consequences, therefore it is paramount to discuss the relationship between the COVID-19 measures and symptomatology of AN to ensure appropriate services are in place to deal with potential outcomes. METHOD: Systematic search of the PubMed database gave thirty-three total results with seven of these used in this review. These studies met the inclusion criteria; examples include primary studies and use of the English Language. The exclusion criteria involved literature reviews, studies with less than ten participants and studies not separating AN from other eating disorders. RESULT: Many studies were cross sectional in nature except two longitudinal studies. Anorexic symptomology increased in the majority of papers in this review. Specifically restricting intake has increased compared to before lockdown measures. Physical activity has varied on an individual level in most studies potentially due to compensatory behaviours. Co-morbid psychopathologies were also noted during these studies. There are many factors behind these changes such as food insecurity, the effect of media and social media, uncertainty and the lack of social interaction. A number of participants across the studies were dissatisfied with treatment services during lockdowns. Variability in study results may be due to the differences in measures between countries and the use of self-reported cases compared to those contacted through care services. Limitations of this review are largely due to the how current the topic is and recommendations for the future include reviewing new studies that are published and to review the situation once the full impact of COVID-19 is known.

It is even more challenging amidst the COVID pandemic, when the influenza-like illness (ILI) counts is affected by various factors such as symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns of the general population. We term the ILI values observed when it is potentially affected as COVID-ILI. Under the current pandemic, historical influenza models carry valuable expertise about the disease dynamics but face difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-NET, a neural transfer learning architecture which allows us to 'steer' a historical disease forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it is should emphasize learning from COVID-related signals and when from the historical model. In such way, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to the current pandemic. In addition, we show that success in our primary goal, adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with state-of-the-art influenza forecasting approaches.","output":"Steering a Historical Disease Forecasting Model Under a Pandemic: Case of Flu and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solid waste management (SWM) is the greatest challenge facing environmental protection and human wellbeing in the rural communities of Maseru (Kingsom of Lesotho). A lack of formal waste management (WM) systems in rural areas of Maseru have resulted in different indigenous systems and practices of SWM.

RDV is taken up in the target cells and metabolized in multiple steps to form the active nucleoside triphosphate (TP) (GS-443902), which in turn acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of multiple viral RNA polymerases. In this report, we profiled the key enzymes involved in the RDV metabolic pathway with multiple parallel approaches: (1) bioinformatic analysis of nucleoside/tide metabolic enzyme mRNA expression using public human tissue and lung single-cell RNAseq datasets; (2) protein and mRNA quantification of enzymes in human lung tissue and primary lung cells; (3) biochemical studies on the catalytic rate of key enzymes; (4) effects of specific enzyme inhibitors on the GS-443902 formation; and (5) the effects of these inhibitors on RDV antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Our data collectively demonstrated that carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and cathepsin A (CatA) are enzymes involved in hydrolyzing RDV to its alanine intermediate Met X, which is further hydrolyzed to the monophosphate form by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1). The monophosphate is then consecutively phosphorylated to diphosphate and triphosphate by cellular phosphotransferases. Our data support the hypothesis that the unique properties of RDV prodrug not only allow lung-specific accumulation critical for the treatment of respiratory viral infection such as COVID-19, they also enable efficient intracellular metabolism of RDV and its Met X to monophosphate and successive phosphorylation to form the active TP in disease-relevant cells.","output":"Key Metabolic Enzymes Involved in Remdesivir Activation in Human Lung Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to correlate the radiographic findings of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive children with their clinical and laboratory findings, discuss the frequency and necessity of chest computed tomography (CT) used for the radiological imaging in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine pediatric inpatient cases were retrospectively analyzed using their clinical, laboratory, and imaging features. The National Public Health Guide was used in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients. COVID-19 infections for all patients were confirmed by the COVID-19 nucleic acid test using a pharyngeal swab. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 11 [3-15] years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (40,6%) and cough (33,3%). When the laboratory findings of patients were examined, the median WBC count was 5.8/mm3 [4.8-8.05/mm3 ], median lymphocyte count was 2.3/mm3 [1.7-3.55/mm3 ], and median C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 2.3/mm3 [1-2.1/mm3 ]. All patients had chest radiographs (CRXs), while only 44.9% of the patients underwent a chest CT. The 8.7% of CXRs and 12.8% of chest CT findings were found as pathological. Ground-glass opacity was the most frequent finding. In the tomography group, the count of lymphocytes was lower, and creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher. The patients with pathological tomography findings demonstrated no statistically significant difference in lymphocyte count, and CK and LDH levels; however, their CRP value was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: In this study, it is emphasized that chest CT should be requested by considering the underlying diseases and severity of clinical findings in pediatric patients. In this way, unnecessary chest CT could be prevented in the pediatric population.","output":"Use of Radiological Tests in COVID-19 Positive Child Cases: Is Chest Computed Tomography Necessary?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a self-limiting and recurrent disease but the cost is considerable. The number of patients with BPPV increased significantly under the quarantine policy in Hangzhou. The unhealthy lifestyle risk factors of BPPV have not yet been investigated. Thus, the objective is to analyze whether an unhealthy lifestyle is a risk factor of BPPV. Methods: One hundred and sixty three patients with idiopathic BPPV aged 22C87 years (BPPV group), and 89 aged 23C92 years sex-matched control subjects (non-BPPV group) were enrolled in this study. All BPPV patients received a definitive diagnosis which excluded secondary BPPV. Non-BPPV cases excluded BPPV, sudden deafness, Meniere's disease, ear or craniofacial surgery, vestibular neuritis, and head trauma history. We obtained a blood lipids profile, serum uric acid, total bilirubin, and related diagnostic information through the electronic medical record system. To get the time of physical activities and recumbent positions, we asked the patient or their family from February 2020 to June 2020, and the rest of the patient's information was acquired by phone or WeChat. Data Analyses: The t-test or chi-squared test, univariate, and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed for the two groups. For each factor, odds ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Moreover, test equality of two or more receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to the physical activities, and recumbent position time; area under curve (AUC) measures were calculated with 95% CIs and compared with each other. Results: The BPPV group had unhealthy lifestyles such as poor physical activities, prolonged recumbent position time, and low rate of calcium or VD supplementation in univariate logistic regression analyses (P < 0.05). Poor physical activities and prolonged recumbent position time were independently associated with BPPV in multiple logistic regression models (OR = 18.92, 95% CI: 6.34C56.43, p = 0.00 and OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01C1.33, p < 0.04). In the comparison of ROC curves of recumbent position time and physical activities in identifying BPPV, AUCs were 0.68 (0.61C0.74), and 0.68 (0.63C0.73), respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that poor physical activities and prolonged recumbent position time may be independent risk factors for BPPV patients, but hypertension, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, hemoglobin, diabetes, serum bilirubin, CHD, and CI, may not be.","output":"Unhealthy Lifestyle Is an Important Risk Factor of Idiopathic BPPV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUE ADDRESSED: The emergence of COVID\\\\19 forced the health industry to re\\\\imagine its role and drove Work Integrated Learning (WIL) practicums into virtual spaces, adding complexity for students in these programs.

STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials that compared antiviral therapy with placebo, standard care, or no treatment. PARTICIPANTS Critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS Antiviral therapy. ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF BIAS Cochrane risk of bias tool. METHODS OF DATA SYNTHESIS Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model for meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis. RESULTS Nine trials with a broad spectrum of critically ill patients were included. No association was found between antiviral therapy and all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up (nine trials; 1790 patients; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79-1.11; I2 = 3%). Trial sequential analysis showed that the cumulative Z-curve crossed the futility boundary establishing sufficient evidence. No association also was found between antiviral therapy and 28-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, or 90-day mortality. But antiviral therapy was associated with a reduction in viral reactivation (five trials; 644 patients; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14-0.37; I2 = 0%). Trial sequential analysis showed that the cumulative Z-curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit establishing sufficient evidence. Antiviral therapy was not associated with an increased risk of renal insufficiency (eight trials; 1574 patients; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73-1.05; I2 =0%).

Using the median method, the total sample has been divided into two groups, the one with less and the one with more infected people. The results of cross section regression analysis show that 52% variations in the Economic stimulus in the total sample is determined by predictor variables in the model. Analysis for the countries with less infected people shows that more than 75% variations in the Economic stimulus is determined by joint trends of the predictor variables, while the Analysis with more infected cases shows coefficient of determination (R-2) over 71%. In general, the results of econometric analysis unambiguously show that democracy contributes to the economic policy response to pandemic in all three observed cases. Stringency index contributes to democracy in an inversely proportional sense, especially in the case of countries with larger number of infected persons.

Besides, molecular docking was performed to reveal the binding and interaction of the ligand at the active site of GSK-3. We found two compounds such as 6961 and 6966, which exhibited steady-state interaction with GSK-3 for 30 ns in molecular dynamics simulation. The compounds (6961 and 6966) also achieved a docking score of -9.05 kcal/mol and -8.11 kcal/mol, respectively, which is relatively higher than the GSK-3 II inhibitor (-6.73 kcal/mol).

METHODS: Here, we use systematic review to develop a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. We then comparatively meta-analyze the data and model individual infectiousness by shedding viable virus via respiratory droplets and aerosols. RESULTS: The analyses indicate heterogeneity in rVL as an intrinsic virological factor facilitating greater overdispersion for SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 pandemic than A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2009 influenza pandemic. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity remains broad throughout the infectious period, including for pediatric and asymptomatic infections. Hence, many COVID-19 cases inherently present minimal transmission risk, whereas highly infectious individuals shed tens to thousands of SARS-CoV-2 virions/min via droplets and aerosols while breathing, talking and singing. Coughing increases the contagiousness, especially in close contact, of symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones. Infectiousness tends to be elevated between 1 and 5 days post-symptom onset.

Moreover, the attitudes of head physicians to current needs and future service development were explored. RESULTS: A total of 15 psychogeriatric units were identified (3 in Bulgaria, 8 in Greece, and 4 in North Macedonia).

Analyzing georeferenced genetic data often relies on the assumption that samples are preferentially collected in densely populated areas of the habitat. Deviation from this assumption negatively impacts the inference of the spatial and demographic dynamics. This issue is pervasive in phylogeography. It affects analyses that approximate the habitat as a set of discrete demes as well as those that treat it as a continuum. The present study introduces a Bayesian modeling approach that explicitly accommodates for spatial sampling strategies. An original inference technique, based on recent advances in statistical computing, is then described that is most suited to modeling data where sequences are preferentially collected at certain locations, independently of the outcome of the evolutionary process. The analysis of georeferenced genetic sequences from the West Nile virus in North America along with simulated data shows how assumptions about spatial sampling may impact our understanding of the forces shaping biodiversity across time and space.","output":"Accounting for spatial sampling patterns in Bayesian phylogeography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this study is to investigate the status of traffic safety and the public perception of traffic safety during the during COVID-19 pandemic.

Results showed that during COVID-19 period, the total number of crashes in Qatar significantly reduced during the pandemic compared with the previous 5 years. However, the rates of serious and fatal injuries significantly increased. Regarding the general public perceptions, more than 80% reported that roads became safer while driving behaviours improved during the pandemic. On the other hand, more than 50% of the experts disagreed that roads became safer, 55% disagreed that driving behaviours improved and 70% agreed that less attention from governments was directed toward road safety during the pandemic. The findings from this study could help policy makers to understand the road safety status during the pandemic to make appropriate adjustments in the traffic laws and regulations on a temporary basis.

The objective of this broad evidence synthesis is to identify and summarise the available literature regarding the efficacy of different personal protective equipment (PPE) in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery in low-resource environments. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram. This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in HCWs involved in emergency trauma surgery. Critical appraisal of eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardised data extraction tool in Covidence.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV NL63 neutralization activity was analyzed with pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. RESULTS: COVID-19 severity increased with age and male patients encountered more serious symptoms than females. Disease severity correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA and the neutralization activity of the antibodies. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies decreased with time after PCR conformation of the infection and antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein waned faster than spike directed antibodies. In contrast, for the common flu coronavirus NL63, COVID19 disease severity seemed to correlate with low NL63-neutralizing activities, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactive protection.

Methods. Patients with AMI treated in hospital from June 2019 to December 2020 were selected as subjects. According to the results of an echocardiogram, the patients were divided into the STEMI group (44 cases) and the NSTEMI group (36 cases). All patients received CAG. All images were denoised and edge detected by a convolutional neural network algorithm. Then, the number of diseased vessels, the location of diseased vessels, and the degree of stenosis of diseased vessels in the two groups were compared and analyzed. Results. The number of patients with complete occlusion (3 cases vs. 12 cases) and collateral circulation (5 cases vs. 20 cases) in the NSTEMI group was significantly higher than that in the STEMI group, and the difference was statistically significant, P < 0.05. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of lesions between the distal LAD (1 case vs. 10 cases) and the distal LCX (4 cases vs. 11 cases), P < 0.05.

ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron BA.2/BA.2.12.1 surge in relation to official case counts, and to assess the epidemiology of infection and uptake of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. DesignCross-sectional survey of a representative sample of New York City (NYC) adult residents, conducted May 7-8, 2022. SettingNYC, April 23-May 8, 2022, during which the official SARS-CoV-2 case count was 49,253 and BA.2.12.2 comprised 20% of reported cases. ParticipantsA representative sample of 1,030 NYC adult residents >18 years. Exposure(s)Vulnerability to severe COVID-19, including vaccination/booster status, prior COVID, age, and presence of comorbidities. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 14-day period, weighted to represent the NYC adult population. Respondents self-reported on SARS-CoV-2 testing (including at-home rapid antigen tests), testing outcomes, COVID-like symptoms, and contact with confirmed/probable cases. Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 were asked about awareness/use of antiviral medications. ResultsAn estimated 22.1% (95%CI 17.9%-26.2%) of respondents had SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period, corresponding to [~]1.5 million adults (95%CI 1.3-1.8 million). Prevalence was estimated at 34.9% (95%CI 26.9%-42.8%) among individuals with co-morbidities, 14.9% (95% CI 11.0%-18.8%) among those 65+ years, and 18.9% (95%CI 10.2%-27.5%) among unvaccinated persons. Hybrid protection against severe disease (i.e., from both vaccination and prior infection) was 66.2% (95%CI 55.7%-76.7%) among those with COVID and 46.3% (95%CI 40.2-52.2) among those without.

YmdB overexpression was used to model YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in vivo, and microarray analysis identified gene targets and cellular processes related to RNase III inhibition. RESULTS: The expression of >2,000 E. coli genes was modulated by YmdB induction; 129 genes were strongly regulated, of which 80 have not been reported as RNase III targets. Of these, ten are involved in biofilm formation. Significantly, YmdB overexpression also inhibited biofilm formation via a process that is not uniquely dependent upon RNase III inhibition. Moreover, biofilm formation is interdependently regulated by RpoS, a known stress response regulator and biofilm inhibitor, and by YmdB.

This study aimed to assess the association between core air pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables and daily confirmed COVID-19 case numbers in Singapore. Data on air pollutant levels (particulate matter [PM2.5, PM10], ozone [O3], carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], sulphur dioxide [SO2], pollutant standards index [PSI]) and meteorological factors (rainfall, humidity, temperature) was obtained from the Singapore National Environment Agency (NEA) from January 23, 2020 to April 6, 2020. The daily reported COVID-19 case numbers were retrieved from the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH). Generalized linear models with Poisson family distribution and log-link were used to estimate the model coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors (8-day and 15-day moving averages (MA)) with COVID-19 case numbers, adjusting for humidity, rainfall and day of week. We observed significantly positive associations between NO2, PSI, PM2.5 and temperature with COVID-19 case numbers.

Although efforts have been made to understand the mental health consequences of the pandemic and corresponding containment measures, the impacts of accessibility loss remain underexplored. METHODS: Based on 186 family interviews, a 569-respondent panel survey was designed and distributed monthly from February to October 2020 in Kunming, China. A 3-wave cross-lagged panel model was developed to understand the causal relationship between mental health and perceived accessibility of daily necessities, key services, and social activities. RESULTS: Goodness-of-fit indicators imply that the hypothesised model fits the observed data well: (2)/df = 2.221, AGFI = 0.910, NFI = 0.907, CFI = 0.933, RMSEA = 0.052. The results indicate that perceived accessibility of daily necessities and social activities had lagged effects on mental health status. The within-wave effects show that perceived accessibility of daily necessities (0.619, p < 0.01) and social activities (0.545, p < 0.01) significantly influenced respondents' mental health during the peak of the pandemic whilst perceived accessibility of social activities dominantly influenced their mental health after restrictions were lifted (0.779, p < 0.01). Perceived accessibility of public services such as healthcare did not significantly influence respondents mental health in any wave. COVID-19 containment policies had different mental outcomes across population groups. Disadvantaged people experienced mental health issues due to accessibility loss for daily necessities and social activities until the lifting of compulsory QR-code-for-buses, whilst better-off populations had better mental health during the early phase of the outbreak and rapidly recovered their mental health after mobility restrictions eased.

However, the composition of these segments can vary greatly, inherently resulting in different base rate percentages about the same health issue (e.g. '51.9% of all COVID 19-related deaths in the U.S. occurred among Caucasians' vs. '16.6% of all COVID 19-related deaths in the U.S. occurred among Hispanics') that can potentially lead to different responses from consumers. Therefore, this research examines how individuals process, and respond to, manipulated base rates. Study 1 demonstrates that higher (vs. lower) base rates increase individuals' healthy behavioural intentions by elevating their risk perceptions. Study 2 uncovers a more complex serial process underlying the impact of base rates on intentions to follow recommended behaviours in health messages. Importantly, we demonstrate a critical effect reversal such that higher base rates have an unintended negative impact on individuals' compliance intentions when involvement is lower (vs. higher). Overall, our findings show how the use of base rates in health messages can serve as a 'double-edged sword'.

Here we assessed the efficacy and safety of ivabradine prolonged-release (PR) once-daily (test) vs. ivabradine immediate-release (IR) twice-daily (reference) formulations in patients with stable chronic HF with systolic dysfunction. METHODS Patients with sinus rhythm and heart rate (HR)  50 bpm, left ventricular ejection fraction  40% (HF with reduced ejection fraction), on guideline-based standard care, receiving a stable dose of ivabradine IR 5/7.5 mg twice daily for  1 month were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ivabradine PR (10 mg/15 mg) based on the ivabradine IR dosage or continued ivabradine IR (5 mg/7.5 mg). The primary endpoint was change in resting ECG HR from baseline to the end of 3 months, assessed by 12-lead ECG. Safety assessments and 24-h Holter HR monitoring (in a subgroup of patients) were also performed. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the difference between the test and reference was less than the margin of 6.5 bpm in the per-protocol set. RESULTS A total of 169 out of 180 randomized patients (93.9%) completed the study (PR = 84; IR = 85). The least-square mean (standard error [SE]) for change in HR from baseline to 3 months was 0.76 (1.188; 95% CI -1.59:3.11) in ivabradine PR vs. ivabradine IR, which was within the pre-specified margin of 6.5 bpm, confirming the non-inferiority of ivabradine PR. The change from baseline to 3 months was comparable between the treatment groups for 24-h Holter ECG monitoring (p = 0.3701), mean HR awake (p = 0.3423), and mean HR asleep (p = 0.1501). Thirty-nine treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported; the majority in both groups were of mild or moderate severity and were subsequently resolved. Seven serious adverse events were reported (ivabradine PR = 2; ivabradine IR = 5), of which one was fatal (ivabradine IR group). The bradycardia events reported were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION Ivabradine PR was found to be non-inferior to ivabradine IR in the management of patients with stable CHF, with a comparable safety profile. Once-daily ivabradine PR effectively maintained the HR in patients shifted from the ivabradine IR twice-daily regimen, and thus may aid in improving treatment compliance.

This study evaluated stress level in this population in Vietnam and their coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2020 among 563 public health and preventive medicine students. A structured questionnaire included background information, the level of stress measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and coping strategies evaluated by the Brief COPE. To compare the PSS score and Brief COPE score among participants with different characteristics, two-sided t tests or ANOVA tests were used when appropriate. RESULTS: Most participants were females (71.4%), and the mean age was 21.6 years old (SD = 2.1). Almost all had moderate to high levels of knowledge, attitude and skill toward COVID-19 prevention and protection. The mean PSS score was 17.02 (SD 4.06), and more than 80% had a certain level of stress. The mean score of approach coping strategies was higher than avoidant coping strategies (2.74 and 1.84). Students with a high level of stress had a higher preference for avoidance coping strategies. CONCLUSION: Although students reported relatively good knowledge, attitude and skill as well as the preference for adaptive coping strategies, they experienced a high level of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Perceived Stress and Coping Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Public Health and Preventive Medicine Students in Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aberrant expression level of SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor gene ACE2 was reported in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) comorbidity of COVID-19. However, the association of ACE2 expression levels with immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming in LUAD remains lacking. We investigated the expression level of ACE2, an association of ACE2 expression level with various types of immune signatures, immune ratios, and pathways. We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) R package to identify the gene modules and investigated prognostic roles of hub genes in LUAD. Overexpression of ACE2 level was found in LUAD and ACE2 expression was negatively associated with various types of immune signatures including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ regulatory T cells, NK cells, and T cell activation. Besides, ACE2 upregulation was not only associated with CD8+ T cell/CD4+ regulatory T cell ratios but also linked with downregulation of immune-markers including CD8A, KLRC1, GZMA, GZMB, NKG7, CCL4, and IFNG. Moreover, the ACE2 expression level was found to be associated with the enrichment level of various metabolic pathways and it was also found that the metabolic pathways are directly positively correlated with the increased expression levels of ACE2, indicating that the overexpression of ACE2 is associated with metabolic reprogramming in LUAD. Furthermore, WGCNA based analysis revealed the gene modules in the high-ACE2-expression-level group of LUAD and identified GCLC and SLC7A11 hub genes which are not only highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma but also correlated with the poor survival prognosis. Our analysis of ACE2 in LUAD tissues suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also associated with immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming. This study underlines the clue for understanding the clinical significance of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients with LUAD comorbidity.","output":"Expression of SARS-COV-2 cell receptor gene ACE2 is associated with immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming in lung adenocarcinoma based on bioinformatics analyses of gene expression profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This document outlines different testing strategies that could be applied by countries based on their epidemiological situation, available testing capacities, infrastructure and objectives. The testing approaches have been published in several previous ECDC documents, including the most recent (eleventh) update of the Rapid Risk Assessment, where ECDC recommends that testing efforts be maximised, with the aim of offering timely testing to all symptomatic cases in order to ensure isolation of the case and tracing and quarantine of their contacts. An expanded, but targeted testing approach is outlined, based upon active surveillance and early detection of all symptomatic cases, developed and adapted through ongoing assessment of the local epidemiological situation. Robust, easy-to-access testing is crucial in order to identify localised resurgence early on. This may facilitate the implementation of targeted mitigation measures rather than applying burdensome blanket mitigation measures for an entire population. Member States within the EU/EEA and the UK should maintain the core capacity to test all symptomatic cases and their symptomatic contacts, and focus on optimising testing strategies to ensure quick turnaround times and robust contact tracing efforts. ECDC also suggests taking a more comprehensive approach, with a low threshold for testing asymptomatic people in specific settings where there are known high-risk populations (e.g. in LTCFs and prisons). Consideration should be given to testing irrespective of symptoms for those in healthcare and social-care settings (staff, patients, residents) or for other vulnerable populations. If resources permit, people who have had a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case (close contacts) could also be included in this testing approach. Such testing should not compromise the accessibility or timeliness of testing for those who are symptomatic, and should be regularly evaluated to provide evidence on the effectiveness of the strategy. Testing strategies should remain flexible and should be adapted to the local epidemiological situation, population dynamics, and resources at the local level.","output":"COVID-19 testing strategies and objectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome assembly is a fundamental tool for biological research.

Previous studies have shown that ingestion of 2 l of polyethylenglycol (PEG) 12 hours prior to capsule ingestion leads to improved visibility in comparison to no preparation at all. We speculated that using a post-ingestion (PI), booster-based cleansing protocol might provide an alternative to the PEG cleansing protocol. METHODS This randomized, blinded, prospective study enrolled 45 individuals. Patients were allocated to either of two groups. The PEG group ingested 2 l PEG 12 hours prior to the exam (n = 22) and the PI group ingested one sachet of Picolax? dissolved in 250 ml of water one hour after swallowing the capsule with 500 ml of water (n = 18). Primary endpoints were overall small bowel and distal third of small bowel cleansing levels. Secondary endpoints were average gastric and small-bowel transit time. RESULTS Forty-five patients participated in this study. Five individuals were excluded because of incomplete study. Percentage of patients with adequate visibility in the distal third of the small bowel in the PEG group was 9% vs 72% in the PI group (p < 0.0001).

Bacteriophage therapy has experienced resurgence to compensate for the limited development of novel antibiotics. However, phage therapy is limited to a compassionate use so far, resulting from lack of adequate studies in relevant pharmacological models. We used a pig model of pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa that recapitulates essential features of human disease to study the antimicrobial efficacy of nebulized-phage therapy. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: (i) Lysis kinetic assays were performed to evaluate in vitro phage antibacterial efficacy against P. aeruginosa and select relevant combinations of lytic phages. (ii) The efficacy of the phage combinations was investigated in vivo (murine model of P. aeruginosa lung infection). (iii) We determined the optimal conditions to ensure efficient phage delivery by aerosol during mechanical ventilation. (iv) Lung antimicrobial efficacy of inhaled-phage therapy was evaluated in pigs, which were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and infected with P. aeruginosa. KEY RESULTS: By selecting an active phage cocktail and optimizing aerosol delivery conditions, we were able to deliver high phage concentrations in the lungs, which resulted in a rapid and marked reduction in P. aeruginosa density (1.5 Log reduction, p<0.001). No infective phage was detected in the sera and urines throughout the experiment.

Unfortunately, this unusual feature can often lead to missed or delayed diagnosis with potential life-threatening outcomes. Clinical Case: The patient is a 53-year-old Caucasian male with PMH of type 2 diabetes mellitus treating with Metformin and Empagliflozin. He presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms, and decreased oral intake for a couple of days. Vital signs at presentation were: Temperature 98.2 F, pulse rate 108 beats/min, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure 134/72 mmHg. He was alert but ill-looking, moderately dehydrated with dry mucus membranes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable at the time of admission. In the initial blood work, sugar was found to be mildly elevated (163mg/dl), and hemoconcentration besides mild pre-renal acute kidney injury was detected. He was also found infected by the COVID-19 virus without hypoxemia or signs of pneumonia. Arterial blood gases showed metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap (PH 7.21, CO(2) 39.93mmHg, HCO(3)(?) 10mEq/L, anion gap 21mEq/L). Urine analysis was positive for ketones and glucose. After ruling out other causes of metabolic acidosis by screening for alcohols, salicylates, acetaminophen, lactic acid, and urine toxicology; the diagnosis of EDKA was made. He was treated with a 3L bolus of IV normal saline and an insulin drip with dextrose solution started as per the protocol based on his glucose levels and promptly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Serial blood tests showed gradual resolution of ketoacidosis and anion gap normalized after 36 hours when insulin drip was stopped and replaced by subcutaneous insulin therapy. Conclusion: SGLT2 inhibitors increase the urinary excretion rate of glucose and subsequent fall in plasma glucose level. Thus, In the absence of exogenous insulin use, increase glucagon release resulting in upregulation of lipolysis and activation of the ketogenesis. Factors such as low oral intake, concurrent infection, and alcohol use can also exacerbate the process.

The airborne viruses were collected on heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters in an experimental apparatus and also sampled upstream of these test filters using AGI-30 and BioSampler impinger samplers. To study the effects of relative humidity (RH) on TGEV collection by the filters and samplers, the virus was nebulized into air at 30, 50, 70, and 90% RH. There were no significant changes in virus titer in the nebulizer suspension before and after nebulization for either nebulizer at any of the pressures utilized. Aerosolization efficiency C the ratio of viable virus sampled with impingers to the quantity of viable virus nebulized C decreased with increasing humidity. BioSamplers detected more airborne virus than AGI-30 samplers at all RH levels. This difference was statistically significant at 30 and 50% RH. Nebulizer type and pressure did not significantly affect the viability of the airborne virus. Virus recovery from test filters relative to the concentration of virus in the nebulizer suspension was less than 10%. The most and the least virus were recovered from filter media at 30% and 90% RH, respectively. The results suggest that TGEV, and perhaps other coronaviruses, remain viable longer in an airborne state and are sampled more effectively at low RH than at high humidity.","output":"Effects of humidity and other factors on the generation and sampling of a coronavirus aerosol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND.: During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people are under the dual pressure of interpersonal isolation and concerns about infection. An evaluation of people's psychological status and risk factors is needed to conduct target interventions. METHODS.: This was a nationwide, multicenter, cross-sectional study using quota and snowball sampling methods during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Participants' characteristics and experiences were obtained by an online questionnaire and telephone review. Psychological distress and sleep problems were measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Insomnia Severity Index. RESULTS.: A total of 23,500 participants were recruited, and 19,372 valid questionnaires were received from 11 centers. Overall, 11.0-13.3% of the participants had anxiety, depression, or insomnia symptoms, and 1.9-2.7% had severe symptoms. The prevalence of psychological and sleep problems has increased.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the technological and social differences among countries, mainly due to the poor quality, or even absence, of Internet connectivity. HIBSs might efficiently support reducing the digital divide, since they provide connectivity to the same mobile devices as the terrestrial networks, which allows this non-terrestrial connectivity solution to increase global coverage and expand mobile connectivity for everyone.

The tree topology of Betacoronavirus is remarkably consistent with biologist's systematics. Because the tree construction contains enough information about virus mutants, it is suitable to study the evolutionary relationship between novel coronavirus mutants transmitted among humans. The emergences of 14 kinds of main mutants are studied and these strains can be classified as eight bifurcations of the phylogenetic tree. It is found that there exist three types of virus mutations, namely, the mutation among sub-branches of the same branch, the off-root mutation and the root-oriented mutation between large branches of the tree. From the point of the relation between viral mutation and host selection we found that individuals with low immunity provide a special environment for the positive natural selection of virus evolution. It gives a mechanism to explain why large mutations between two distant branches generally occur in the nCov-19 phylogenetic tree.

Since the creation of the GST platform and associated training pipeline in 2017, course adjustments and improvements have relied on expert opinion and anecdote. To gain a more robust understanding of GST deployment clinical and operational activities, we conducted a survey of all surgeons who completed GST Phase 1 training from its inception in April 2017 to September 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS 87 surgeons took the course from April 2017 to September 2020. 60 of those surgeons were still on active duty and were candidates to complete the survey sent from the Air Force Survey Office. 31 individuals responded and their identification was kept blinded. An IRB exemption was issued before study initiation. RESULTS Of the 31 respondents, 9 took the GST Phase 1 course but never deployed, and were excluded. The remaining 22 surgeons deployed at some point from 2017 to 2020. Four surgeons reported providing no surgical care during their deployment. 68% of the surgeons deployed to an actual standalone GST platform, while the rest were retained at larger military treatment facilities (MTFs) or Role III facilities. The median number of surgeries performed was 2 for surgeons at standalone GSTs and 7 for those at larger MTFs/Role IIIs. A holding time of greater than 12 hours was reported for 15% of operative patients and 58% of nonoperative patients at standalone GSTs. 28% (n = 5) of surgeons reported taking care of patients in the Golden Hour of surgery, and 23% of teams reported a patient death. Two surgeons cared for a military working dog, and four surgeons cared for pediatric patients. 50% of surgeons had more than one patient present simultaneously for care. 50% of surgeons' resupply were in the greater than 30 days or never received category. CONCLUSIONS The GST Phase 1 course has a unique role in preparing students to provide austere surgical care. This includes both preparing to function in the operational military environment as well as applying sound in-garrison trauma surgical care techniques to the austere, resource variable environment. The results of this survey suggest that a broadening of content-specific deployment-related topics, the formalization of documentation education, incorporating formal evidence-based nontechnical skills training, and identifying optimal GST context-specific behaviors will strengthen the effectiveness of the course in preparing students for deployment.","output":"Aligning Air Force Ground Surgical Team (GST) Training With the Deployment Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with unintentional weight loss. Little is known on whether and how patients regain the lost weight. We assessed changes in weight and abdominal adiposity over a three-month follow-up after discharge in COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: In this sub-study of a large prospective observational investigation, we collected data from individuals who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and re-evaluated at one (V1) and three (V2) months after discharge. Patient characteristics upon admission and anthropometrics, waist circumference and hunger levels assessed during follow-up were analyzed across BMI categories. RESULTS: One-hundred-eighty-five COVID-19 survivors (71% male, median age 62.1 [54.3; 72.1] years, 80% with overweight/obesity) were included. Median BMI did not change from admission to V1 in normal weight subjects (-0.5 [-1.2; 0.6] kg/m2, p = 0.08), but significantly decreased in subjects with overweight (-0.8 [-1.8; 0.3] kg/m2, p < 0.001) or obesity (-1.38 [-3.4; -0.3] kg/m2, p < 0.001; p < 0.05 vs. normal weight or obesity). Median BMI did not change from V1 to V2 in normal weight individuals (+0.26 [-0.34; 1.15] kg/m2, p = 0.12), but significantly increased in subjects with overweight (+0.4 [0.0; 1.0] kg/m2, p < 0.001) or obesity (+0.89 [0.0; 1.6] kg/m2, p < 0.001; p = 0.01 vs. normal weight). Waist circumference significantly increased from V1 to V2 in the whole group (p < 0.001), driven by the groups with overweight or obesity. At multivariable regression analyses, male sex, hunger at V1 and initial weight loss predicted weight gain at V2.

Some studies have focused on how personality predicts distinct patterns of adherence to protective measures with psychopathic and antisocial traits predicting reduced engagement in such measures. In this study we extended previous findings by analyzing how boldness, meanness, and disinhibition psychopathic traits relate with both risk perceptions and protective behaviors during the first COVID-19 outbreak. A sample of 194 individuals (24% male) engaged in the survey, were assessed for psychopathic traits with the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, and completed a COVID-19 survey targeting risk perceptions (spread, risk of becoming infected, state anxiety toward the COVID-19, and perceived risk of specific behaviors) and frequency of protective behaviors (e.g., not engaging in social distancing). Overall results show that boldness predicts reduced estimate of COVID-19 spread, reduced perceived risk of becoming infected, reduced state anxiety toward COVID-19, and reduced frequency of protective behaviors. Exploratory mediation models suggest that risk perceptions are not significant mediators of the association between psychopathic traits and reduced engagement in protective behaviors. Our results unveil that psychopathic traits affect risk perceptions and the propensity to engage in protective measures, emphasizing the need to accommodate these personality features in the public health strategy to control the COVID-19 spread.","output":"Boldness Personality Traits Are Associated With Reduced Risk Perceptions and Adoption of Protective Behaviors During the First COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 was a global event for which nurses had limited time to prepare before receiving an influx of high-acuity patients and navigating new plans of care.

The devastation of the on-going global pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is likely to be escalated by these circumstances with expectations of the impact of the disease being severe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we formulate a mathematical model that incorporates the currently known disease characteristics and tracks various intervention measures that the government of Uganda has implemented since the reporting of the first case in March 2020. We then evaluate these measures to understand levels of responsiveness and adherence to standard operating procedures and quantify their impact on the disease burden. Novel in this model was the unique aspect of modeling the trace-and-isolate protocol in which some of the latently infected individuals tested positive while in strict isolation centers thereby reducing their infectious period. RESULTS: The study findings show that even with elimination of all imported cases at any given time it would take up to nine months to rid Uganda of the disease. The findings also show that the optimal timing of easing of lockdowns while mitigating the possibility of re-emergence of a second epidemic wave requires avoiding the scenario of releasing too-many-too-soon. It is even more worrying that enhancing contact tracing would only affect the magnitude and timing of the second wave but cannot prevent it altogether. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, given the prevailing circumstances, a phased-out lifting of lockdown measures, minimization of COVID-19 transmissibility within hospital settings, elimination of recruitment of infected individuals as well as enhanced contact tracing would be key to preventing overwhelming of the healthcare system that would come with dire consequences.","output":"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Uganda: Implications of complacency and early easing of lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCW) are heavily exposed to SARS-CoV-2 from the beginning of the pandemic. We aimed to analyze risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion among HCW with a special emphasis on the respective healthcare institutions recommendation regarding the use of FFP-2 masks. METHODS: We recruited HCW from 13 health care institutions (HCI) with different mask policies (type IIR surgical face masks vs. FFP-2 masks) in Southeastern Switzerland (canton of Grisons). Sera of participants were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 6 months apart, after the first and during the second pandemic wave using an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA, Roche Diagnostics). We captured risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection by using an online questionnaire at both time points. The effects of individual COVID-19 exposure, regional incidence and FFP-2 mask policy on the probability of seroconversion were evaluated with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 99 of 2794 (3.5%) HCW at baseline and in 376 of 2315 (16.2%) participants 6 months later. In multivariable analyses the strongest association for seroconversion was exposure to a household member with known COVID-19 (aOR: 19.82, 95% CI 8.11C48.43, p < 0.001 at baseline and aOR: 8.68, 95% CI 6.13C12.29, p < 0.001 at follow-up). Significant occupational risk factors at baseline included exposure to COVID-19 patients (aOR: 2.79, 95% CI 1.28C6.09, p = 0.010) and to SARS-CoV-2 infected co-workers (aOR: 2.50, 95% CI 1.52C4.12, p < 0.001). At follow up 6 months later, non-occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (aOR: 2.54, 95% CI 1.66C3.89 p < 0.001) and the local COVID-19 incidence of the corresponding HCI (aOR: 1.98, 95% CI 1.30C3.02, p = 0.001) were associated with seroconversion. The healthcare institutions mask policy (surgical masks during usual exposure vs. general use of FFP-2 masks) did not affect seroconversion rates of HCW during the first and the second pandemic wave. CONCLUSION: Contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected household members was the most important risk factor for seroconversion among HCW. The strongest occupational risk factor was exposure to COVID-19 patients. During this pandemic, with heavy non-occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the mask policy of HCIs did not affect the seroconversion rate of HCWs.

In a global perspective, public health has played major roles in structuring how microbes are perceived, cultivated, and destroyed. The germ theory of disease cast microbes as enemies of the body and the body politic. Antibiotics have altered microbial development by providing stringent natural selection on bacterial species, and this has led to the formation of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Public health perspectives such as Precision Public Health and One Health have recently been proposed to further manage microbial populations. However, neither of these take into account the symbiotic relationships that exist between bacterial species and between bacteria, viruses, and their eukaryotic hosts. We propose a perspective on public health that recognizes microbial evolution through symbiotic associations (the hologenome theory) and through lateral gene transfer. This perspective has the advantage of including both the pathogenic and beneficial interactions of humans with bacteria, as well as combining the outlook of the One Health model with the genomic methodologies utilized in the Precision Public Health model. In the Anthropocene, the conditions for microbial evolution have been altered by human interventions, and public health initiatives must recognize both the beneficial (indeed, necessary) interactions of microbes with their hosts as well as their pathogenic interactions.","output":"Toward a Symbiotic Perspective on Public Health: Recognizing the Ambivalence of Microbes in the Anthropocene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Histamine is a biogenic amine distributed extensively in the human cells. Histamine is linked with different inflammatory and allergic disorders through promoting of chemoatractant activity and endothelial changes. Antihistamine drugs are effective in the treatment and prevention of infection of influenza H7N9 through inhibition of viral entry to the host cells. A multiplicity of search strategies including experimental, preclinical and clinical studies were taken on and assumed to review the potential role of H1, H2 or their combination in the management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Histamine release is associated with early and late pathology of Covid-19 and clinical presentation. Despite the potential effect of famotidine in attenuating the pathogenesis of Covid-19, famotidine has no direct effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, azelastine (H1receptor blocker) used for allergic rhinitis as nasal spray has potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity comparable to that of remdesivir, lopinavir and chloroquine. Azelastine is more effective than other agents that are used in the management of Covid-19 due to significant inhibition of endosomal acidification at respiratory epithelial cells. However, famotidine and cetirizine combination improve clinical outcome and reduce intubation and duration of hospitalization in Covid-19 patients. Taken together, hospitalised Covid-19 patients treated with famotidine only showed more complications as compared with those treated with combination of famotidine and cetirizine.

First, market risks across the Vietnamese industries have changed significantly in response to the pandemic, both at the level and their rankings. Second, among the changes, the services industry appears to be hardest hit by the pandemic as expected, whereas the education sector has significantly improved its standing during these challenging times.

Maduro has blamed U.S. sanctions for the economic crisis, but many observers cite economic mismanagement and corruption as the main factors. U.N. agencies estimate that 5.1 million Venezuelans have fled the country as of August 2020, primarily to neighboring countries. U.S. Policy Since recognizing the Guaido government in January 2019, the United States has coordinated its efforts with Interim President Guaido. U.S. strategy has emphasized diplomatic efforts to bolster support for Guaido;targeted sanctions and visa revocations to increase pressure on Maduro officials;broader sanctions on the state oil company, other state-controlled companies and institutions, and the government;and humanitarian aid ($534 million to countries sheltering Venezuelans and $76 million for Venezuela from FY2017 through May 2020). In October 2019, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) signed an agreement with the Guaido government enabling the provision of development assistance and increased democracy assistance. In 2020, the Administration has sanctioned companies that have transported Venezuelan oil and seized Venezuela-bound ships carrying Iranian petroleum products in violation of sanctions. U.S. officials have vowed to keep \\"maximum pressure\\" on Maduro and his foreign backers until he agrees to allow a transition government to convene free and fair legislative and presidential elections. Congressional Action Congress has supported the Administration's efforts to support a restoration of democracy in Venezuela without U.S. military intervention in the country and to provide humanitarian support to Venezuelans, although some Members have expressed concerns about the humanitarian impact of sanctions. In December 2019, Congress enacted P.L. 116-94, which appropriates $30 million in FY2020 assistance for democracy programs in Venezuela and incorporates the Senate-reported version of the VERDAD Act (S. 1025), a comprehensive bill to address the crisis in Venezuela. The VERDAD Act incorporated House-passed measures authorizing FY2020 humanitarian aid to Venezuela (H.R. 854), restricting the export of defense articles to Venezuela (H.R. 920), and requiring a U.S. strategy to counter Russian influence in Venezuela (H.R. 1477). In December 2019, Congress also enacted P.L. 116-92, which prohibits federal contracting with persons who do business with the Maduro government. In July 2019, the House passed H.R. 549, designating Venezuela as a beneficiary country for temporary protected status;however, a Senate effort to pass H.R. 549 by unanimous consent failed. For FY2021, the Administration requested $200 million in democracy aid aimed to support a democratic transition in Venezuela and $5 million in global health assistance;the House-passed version of the measure (H.R. 7608, H. Rept. 116-444) would provide $30 in democracy aid for Venezuela and support the provision of additional aid if a democratic transition occurs. The House-passed version of the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 6395, H. Rept. 116-442) would require a report on he crises in Venezuela and its impacts on U.S. and regional security. ? 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","output":"Venezuela: Background and U.S. relations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, several case series of cutaneous acral manifestations in patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) have been reported.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in New York to select plasma donors for a randomized, double\\\\blind, controlled convalescent plasma trial. Clearance for donation required successful completion of an online questionnaire and an in\\\\person screening visit, which included (a) completion of a Donor Health Questionnaire (DHQ), (b) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing using an immunochromatographic anti\\\\ severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) test, (c) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing if <28 days from symptom resolution, and (d) routine blood bank testing. RESULTS: After receiving 3093 online questionnaires, 521 individuals presented for in\\\\person screening visits, with 40.1% (n = 209) fully qualifying. Subjects (n = 312) failed to progress due to the following reasons: disqualifying answer from DHQ (n = 30, 9.6%), insufficient antibodies (n = 198, 63.5%), persistent positive PCR tests (n = 14, 4.5%), and blood donation testing labs (n = 70, 22.4%).

Remotely delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (rCBT) for SHA is evidenced as effective, but many who seek help do not benefit. Motivational processes can influence outcomes, but it is unclear what assessment methods offer the best clinical utility in rCBT for SHA. DESIGN This study compared the predictive validity of patient, therapist and in-session ratings of motivational factors taken at session two of rCBT for SHA among high healthcare users experiencing multimorbidity. METHODS Motivational factors were assessed for 56 participants who attended at least two sessions of CBT for SHA delivered via video-conferencing or telephone. Following session two, therapists and patients completed online assessments of patient motivation. Two trained observers also rated motivational factors and therapeutic alliance from in-session interactions using session two recordings and transcripts. Multilevel modelling was used to predict health anxiety and a range of secondary health outcomes from motivation assessments. RESULTS Where patients were more actively engaged in discussion of positive changes during session two, greater outcome improvements ensued in health anxiety and all secondary outcomes. Conversely, larger proportions of session two spent describing problems predicted poorer outcomes. Therapist and patient assessments of motivation did not predict health anxiety, but therapist assessments of client confidence and motivation predicted all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Motivation remains an important process in CBT when delivered remotely, and motivational factors may predict outcomes more consistently from in-session interactions, compared to self-reports.","output":"The predictive value of patient, therapist, and in-session ratings of motivational factors early in remote cognitive behavioural therapy for severe health anxiety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, is responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has become a challenging world issue. Although most COVID-19 patients primarily develop respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of neurological symptoms and manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been observed. In this narrative review, we elaborate on proposed neurotropic mechanisms and various neurological symptoms, manifestations, and complications of COVID-19 reported in the present literature. For this purpose, a review of all current published literature (studies, case reports, case series, reviews, editorials, and other articles) was conducted and neurological sequelae of COVID-19 were summarized. Essential and common neurological symptoms including gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, myalgia, headache, altered mental status, confusion, delirium, and dizziness are presented separately in sections. Moreover, neurological manifestations and complications that are of great concern such as stroke, cerebral (sinus) venous thrombosis, seizures, meningoencephalitis, GuillainCBarr syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, acute myelitis, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) are also addressed systematically. Future studies that examine the impact of neurological symptoms and manifestations on the course of the disease are needed to further clarify and assess the link between neurological complications and the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. To limit long-term consequences, it is crucial that healthcare professionals can early detect possible neurological symptoms and are well versed in the increasingly common neurological manifestations and complications of COVID-19.","output":"Neurological symptoms, manifestations, and complications associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a respiratory distress syndrome, the main symptom of COVID-19 (for \\"COronaVIrus Disease 2019\\").

In addition to the respiratory sequelae and systemic infection that ensues, an alarming number of micro and macrovascular thrombotic complications have been observed. This review examines the current understanding of COVID-19-associated thrombotic complications, potential mechanisms, and pathobiological basis for thromboses development. RECENT FINDINGS: The endothelium plays a major role in the process due to direct and indirect injury. The immune system also contributes to a pro-thrombotic environment with immune cell dysregulation leading to excessive formation of cytokines, also called cytokine storm, and an eventual promotion of a hypercoagulable environment, known as immunothrombosis. Additionally, neutrophils play an important role by forming neutrophil extracellular traps, which are shown to be pro-thrombotic and further enhanced in COVID-19 patients. A disruption of the fibrinolysis system has also been observed. SUMMARY: Multiple pathways likely contribute synergistically to form a pro-thrombotic milieu. A better understanding of these factors and the complex interplay between them will lead to the improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","output":"The Pathobiological Basis for Thrombotic Complications in COVID-19: a Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Optional features of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems empower patients and caregivers to understand and manage diabetes in new ways. We examined associations between use of optional features, demographics, and glycemic outcomes. Methods: Retrospective cohort studies were performed with data from US-based users of the G6 CGM System (Dexcom, Inc.). For all cohorts, data included sensor glucose values (SGVs). In separate cohorts, use of alert features (for hyperglycemia, existing hypoglycemia, and impending hypoglycemia), remote data sharing feature (Share), software for retrospective pattern analysis (CLARITY), virtual assistant feature that announces the current SGV and trend in response to a spoken request were assessed. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize feature set utilization patterns and relate them to glycemic outcomes. Results: Most individual features were consistently adopted by high proportions of G6 users. Threshold SGVs chosen for activating hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia alerts varied with age and were higher among the youngest and oldest patients. Use of the Share feature was more common among young patients and those with type 1 diabetes. Individuals who used more of the alert and notification features had more favorable glycemic outcomes, including time in range (TIR), than those who used fewer. More extensive engagement with CLARITY notifications was associated with higher TIR. Frequent use of the virtual assistant feature was associated with higher TIR and lower mean SGV. Conclusions: Optional features of the G6 CGM system are acceptable to and appear to benefit patients who use them.

A legal-realist assessment was conducted of the Zimbabwean correctional system response to COVID-19 during state disaster measures, with a focus on assessing right to health, infectious disease mitigation and the extent to which minimum state obligations complied with human and health rights standards. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The Zimbabwean correctional system operations during COVID-19 disaster measures are scrutinized using a range of international, African and domestic human rights instruments in relation to the right to health of prisoners. This study focused particularly on standards of care, environmental conditions of detention and right of access to health care. FINDINGS: Systemic poor standards of detention are observed, where prisoners experience power outages, water shortages and a lack of access to clean drinking water and water for ablution purposes, a severe lack of safe space and adequate ventilation, poor quality food and malnutrition and a lack of sufficient supply of food, medicines, clothing and bedding. Whilst access to health care of prisoners in Zimbabwe has greatly improved in recent times, the standard of care was severely stretched during COVID-19 due to lack of government resourcing and reliance on non-governmental organisation and faith-based organisations to support demand for personal protective equipment, disinfection products and medicines. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Prison conditions in Zimbabwe are conducive to chronic ill health and the spread of many transmissible diseases, not limited to COVID-19. The developed legal-realist account considers whether Zimbabwe had a culture of respect for the rule of law pertinent to human and health rights of those detained during COVID-19 disaster measures, and whether minimum standards of care were upheld.","output":"A legal-realist assessment of the Zimbabwean correctional system response to COVID-19 during state disaster measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus-like particles were found by electron microscopy in stools from infants with necrotizing enterocolitis.

In contrast, data from emergency medical services (EMS) provide a source of information nearly in real time that may be useful for rapid and more granular surveillance of overdose mortality. Objective: To describe racial/ethnic, social, and geographic trends in EMS-observed overdose-associated cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 pandemic through December 2020 and assess the concordance with CDC-reported provisional total overdose mortality through May 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included more than 11a?000 EMS agencies in 49 US states that participate in the National EMS Information System and 83.7 million EMS activations in which patient contact was made. Exposures: Year and month of occurrence of overdose-associated cardiac arrest; patient race/ethnicity; census region and division; county-level urbanicity; and zip code-level racial/ethnic composition, poverty, and educational attainment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overdose-associated cardiac arrests per 100a?000 EMS activations with patient contact in 2020 were compared with a baseline of values from 2018 and 2019. Aggregate numbers of overdose-associated cardiac arrests and percentage increases were compared with provisional total mortality in CDC records from rolling 12-month windows with end months spanning January 2018 through July 2020. Results: Among 33.4 million EMS activations in 2020, 16.8 million (50.2%) involved female patients and 16.3 million (48.8%) involved non-Hispanic White individuals. Overdose-associated cardiac arrests were elevated by 42.1% nationally in 2020 (42.3 per 100a?000 EMS activations at baseline vs 60.1 per 100a?000 EMS activations in 2020). The highest percentage increases were seen among Latinx individuals (49.7%; 38.8 per 100a?000 activations at baseline vs 58.1 per 100a?000 activations in 2020) and Black or African American individuals (50.3%; 21.5 per 100a?000 activations at baseline vs 32.3 per 100a?000 activations in 2020), people living in more impoverished neighborhoods (46.4%; 42.0 per 100a?000 activations at baseline vs 61.5 per 100a?000 activations in 2020), and the Pacific states (63.8%; 33.1 per 100a?000 activations at baseline vs 54.2 per 100a?000 activations in 2020), despite lower rates at baseline for these groups. The EMS records were available 6 to 12 months ahead of CDC mortality figures and showed a high concordance (r = 0.98) for months in which both data sets were available. If the historical association between EMS-observed and total overdose mortality holds true, an expected total of approximately 90a?632 (95% CI, 85a?737-95a?525) overdose deaths may eventually be reported by the CDC for 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, records from EMS agencies provided an effective manner to rapidly surveil shifts in US overdose mortality. Unprecedented overdose deaths during the pandemic necessitate investments in overdose prevention as an essential aspect of the COVID-19 response and postpandemic recovery. This is particularly urgent for more socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority communities subjected to the compounded burden of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality and rising overdose deaths.","output":"Racial/Ethnic, Social, and Geographic Trends in Overdose-Associated Cardiac Arrests Observed by US Emergency Medical Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is demonstrated that according to the first law of thermodynamics the equality of en-tropic and negentropic components is the condition of resonance stationary state of systems. In the systems in which the interaction proceeds along the potential gradient (positive work), the re-sultant potential energy is found based on the principle of adding reciprocals of corresponding values of subsystems. This is the corpuscular process, in which entropy can serve as the theoreti-cal concept. In the systems in which the interactions proceed against the potential gradient (nega-tive work) the algebraic addition of their masses, as well as the corresponding energies of subsys-tems is performed. This is the wave process, in which negentropy can serve as the theoretical con-cept. The resonance stationary state of the systems is fulfilled under the condition of equality of degrees of their corpuscular and wave interactions. The entropy products in stationary state are completely compensated by the negentropy flow. Mathematically and graphically (by nomo-grams) the stationary state in microsystems is found by the following equation containing the tangent of the geodesic angel. The geodesic angle numerically defines the ratio of two legs of the right triangle whose values characterize energy dependencies through axial and circumferential stresses in the system with corpuscular-wave processes.

Even without transmission to the fetus, infection of the placenta itself is associated with pregnancy complications including pregnancy loss and preterm birth. Placental macrophages, also termed Hofbauer cells (HBCs), are fetal-origin macrophages residing in the placenta that are likely involved in responding to placental infection and protection of the developing fetus. As HBCs are the only immune cell present in the villous placenta, they represent one of the final opportunities for control of infection and prevention of passage to the developing fetus. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The objective of this review was to provide a systematic overview of the literature regarding HBC responses during infection in pregnancy, including responses to viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were searched on May 20th, 2021, with no limit on publication date, to identify all papers that have studied placental macrophages/Hofbauer cells in the context of infection. The following search strategy was utilized: (hofbauer* OR hofbauer cells OR hofbauer cell OR placental macrophage OR placental macrophages) AND [infect* OR virus OR viral OR bacteri* OR parasite* OR pathogen* OR LPS OR poly(i:c) OR toxoplasm* OR microb* OR HIV)]. OUTCOMES: 86 studies were identified for review. This included those that investigated HBCs in placentas from pregnancies complicated by maternal infection and in vitro studies investigating HBC responses to pathogens or Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). HBCs can be infected by a variety of pathogens, and HBC hyperplasia was a common observation. HBCs respond to pathogen infection and PAMPs by altering their transcriptional, translational and secretion profiles. Co-culture investigations demonstrate that they can replicate and transmit pathogens to other cells. In other cases, they may eliminate the pathogen through a variety of mechanisms including phagocytosis, cytokine-mediated pathogen elimination, release of macrophage extracellular traps and HBC-antibody-mediated neutralization. HBC responses differ across gestation and may be influenced by pre-existing immunity. Clinical information, including gestational age at infection, gestational age of the samples, mode of sample collection and pregnancy outcome were missing for the majority of studies.","output":"Placental Macrophage (Hofbauer Cell) Responses to Infection During Pregnancy: A Systematic Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The deployment of so-called intelligent vessels at sea can most be expected, if not in the coming years, then certainly in the coming decades.

METHODS: A 38-item electronic questionnaire was disseminated through local team email lists between May 22 and June 7, 2020, to HCWs in a university neurosciences center. Burnout was measured using the single-item Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization scales, and wellbeing and QoL assessed using the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment Scale and the EuroQol-5 Dimension instrument. RESULTS: The response rate was 57.4% (n=234); 58.2% of respondents were nurses, 69.4% were women and 40.1% were aged 25 to 34 years. Overall, 21.4% of respondents reported burnout assessed by the Emotional Exhaustion scale; burnout was higher for nurses (23.5%) and allied health care professionals (22.5%) compared with doctors (16.4%).

Two real cases during the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the application of emerging technologies and digital data in monitoring human movements related to disease spread. Although the ethical issues related to using digital epidemiology are still under debate, the cases reported in this article may enable the identification of more effective public health measures, as well as future applications of such digitally directed epidemiological approaches in controlling infectious disease outbreaks, which offer an alternative and modern outlook on addressing the long-standing challenges in population health.","output":"A New Era of Epidemiology: Digital Epidemiology for Investigating the COVID-19 Outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID- 19 has become a major pandemic affecting more than 11 million people worldwide Common radiological manifestations of COVID-19 include peripheral based ground-glass or consolidative opacities;however, pneumothorax and pneumo-mediastinum are very rare manifestations;even more so within patients not on mechanical ventilation We present a case series of 5 patients with COVID-19 who either presented with or developed spontaneous pneumothorax or pneumo-mediastinum within the course of hospitalization With the exception of one patient, all other patients developed pneumothorax as a late manifestation in their illness;more than 10 days after initial symptom onset in COVID-19 From within this case series, all patients who developed spontaneous pneumothorax or pneumo-mediastinum during hospitalization subsequently succumbed to the illness Spontaneous pneumothorax or pneumo-mediastinum may be an important late manifestation in COVID-19;even in spontaneously breathing patients This may be related to development of cystic changes within the lung parenchyma Although the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown;in our series, it portended a worse prognosis in the majority of patients","output":"Pneumothorax and Pneumomediastinum in COVID-19: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The worldwide pandemic has shifted eService-Learning from a pedagogical innovation into a must, challenging the applicability of frameworks and principles previously developed.

METHODS: All consecutive events reported to the United States Vaccine Adverse Reporting System following COVID-19 vaccines (1 January to 24 June 2021), were assessed. The timing of headache onset post-vaccination in subjects with and without concomitant cerebrovascular events, including cerebral venous thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and intracranial haemorrhage was analysed. The diagnostic accuracy in predicting concurrent cerebrovascular events of the guideline- proposed threshold of three-days from vaccination to headache onset was evaluated. RESULTS: There were 314,610 events following 306,907,697 COVID-19 vaccine doses, including 41,700 headaches, and 178/41,700 (0.4%) cerebrovascular events. The median time between the vaccination and the headache onset was shorter in isolated headache (1 day vs. 4 (in cerebral venous thrombosis), 3 (in ischemic stroke), or 10 (in intracranial hemorrhage) days, all P < 0.001). Delayed onset of headache had an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75-0.97) for cerebral venous thrombosis, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.63-76) for ischemic stroke and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67-84) for intracranial hemorrhage, and >99% negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: Headache following COVID-19 vaccination occurs within 1 day and is rarely associated with cerebrovascular events.

For example, the number of confirmed cases largely underestimates the number of infections, deaths lag infections substantially, while test positivity rates tend to greatly overestimate prevalence. Representative random prevalence surveys, the only putatively unbiased source, are sparse in time and space, and the results come with a big delay. Reliable estimates of population prevalence are necessary for understanding the spread of the virus and the effects of mitigation strategies. We develop a simple Bayesian framework to estimate viral prevalence by combining the main available data sources. It is based on a discrete-time SIR model with time-varying reproductive parameter. Our model includes likelihood components that incorporate data of deaths due to the virus, confirmed cases, and the number of tests administered on each day. We anchor our inference with data from random sample testing surveys in Indiana and Ohio. We use the results from these two states to calibrate the model on positive test counts and proceed to estimate the infection fatality rate and the number of new infections on each day in each state in the USA. We estimate the extent to which reported COVID cases have underestimated true infection counts, which was large, especially in the first months of the pandemic.

The data was obtained from three toxicology laboratories in the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions of the U.S. Fentanyl whole blood concentrations ranged from 0.1 ng/mL to 157 ng/mL in living drivers with a 466% to 524% increase in fentanyl positive DUID cases from 2014 to 2019 depending on the U.S. region. The vast majority of fentanyl cases involved poly-drug use. Twenty case histories are presented where fentanyl was the only drug identified. The mean (SD) fentanyl concentration for these cases was 5.2  3.8 ng/mL with a median of 3.7 ng/mL and the concentrations ranged from 2.0 to 16 ng/mL. Naloxone administration was documented in exactly half of these cases similar to another study involving carfentanil impaired driving.

Endogenous viral elements in host genomes provide separate evidence that viruses similar to many major contemporary groups circulated 100 million years ago or earlier. In this Opinion article, we argue that the extraordinary conservation of virus genome sequences is best explained by a niche-filling model in which fitness optimization is rapidly achieved in their specific hosts. Whereas short-term substitution rates reflect the accumulation of tolerated sequence changes within adapted genomes, longer-term rates increasingly resemble those of their hosts as the evolving niche moulds and effectively imprisons the virus in co-adapted virusChost relationships. Contrastingly, viruses that jump hosts undergo strong and stringent adaptive selection as they maximize their fit to their new niche. This adaptive capability may paradoxically create evolutionary stasis in long-term host relationships. While viruses can evolve and adapt rapidly, their hosts may ultimately shape their longer-term evolution.","output":"Prisoners of war  host adaptation and its constraints on virus evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we introduce a culture system for the isolation, passaging and amplification of avian tracheal epithelial (ATE) cells.

Interestingly, immunocytostaining revealed that basal cells are resistant to IBV infection. We also demonstrate that glycosaminoglycan had no effect on infection of the cells by IBV.

The chylomicron-associated drug is then secreted from the enterocyte into the lymphatic circulation, rather than the portal circulation, thus avoiding the metabolically-active liver, but still ultimately returning to the systemic circulation. Because of this parallel and potentially alternative absorptive pathway, first-pass metabolism can be reduced while increasing lymphatic drug exposure, which opens the potential for novel therapeutic modalities and allows the implementation of lipid-based drug delivery systems. This review discusses the physiological features of the lymphatics, enterocyte uptake and metabolism, links between drug transport and lipid digestion/re-acylation, experimental model (in vivo, in vitro, and in silico) of lymphatic transport, and the design of lipid- or prodrug-based drug delivery systems for enhancing lymphatic drug transport.","output":"Intestinal lymphatic transport for drug delivery()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a viral disease that in the form of a pandemic has spread in the entire world, causing a severe impact on peoples well being.

Using an immunofluorescence assay, we detected an overall seroprevalence of FeMV in almost half of the cats investigated (n = 380), with a significantly increased proportion in younger animals. In comparison to European Shorthair cats, the rate of seropositivity is higher in pedigree cats. Regardless of the breed, FeMV infection was associated with increased blood creatinine concentrations, suggesting an association with CKD. Further analysis indicated that this association was the strongest in animals having high IFA titers against FeMV-2. In addition, a significant association between FeMV-positive status and the prevalence of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD, or idiopathic cystitis) was detected. This association was dominated by cats having antibodies against FeMV-1 only. To further evaluate the positive correlation between FeMV seroprevalence and CKD as well as FLUTD, consideration of additional clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters is warranted, and controlled infection studies with both FeMV genotypes are necessary.

METHODS: RECoVERED, a prospective cohort study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, enrolled participants aged 16 years after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis. Fatigue was measured using the validated Short Fatigue Questionnaire (SFQ; range 4C28) at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 of follow-up. Fatigue severity was modeled over time using mixed-effects linear regression. Determinants of severe fatigue (SFQ 18) at 6 months since illness onset (ie, persistent fatigue) were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: Between May 2020 and July 2021, 303 participants completed at least 1 fatigue questionnaire. Twelve months after illness onset, 17.4% (95% CI, 6.7% to 38.3%), 21.6% (95% CI, 11.2% to 37.7%), and 44.8% (95% CI, 28.0% to 62.9%) of participants with mild, moderate, and severe/critical COVID-19 (World Health Organization definition), respectively, experienced severe fatigue. When adjusting for age and sex, having 3 comorbidities (P = .007), severe/critical COVID-19 (P = .002), low mood (P < .001), and dyspnea in the first 2 weeks of illness (P = .001) were associated with more severe fatigue over time.

Recovery rarely occurred beyond 6 months after illness onset, regardless of COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of severe fatigue in our cohort was high, especially among those with initially severe/critical COVID-19, with little recovery beyond 6 months after illness onset.

The purpose of this study was to analyze pediatric tUCSI epidemiological data, potential variations in treatment and patient outcomes, and to evaluate any specific trends that may be clinically relevant. Methodology We conducted a retrospective cohort study on pediatric patients ages 1 day to 16 years old, admitted for tUCSI over the past 10 years (1/2011 to 1/2021) at a Midwest level 1 trauma center. Retrospective data was queried using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes for tUCSI. Children were stratified into three age groups: Group 1 - Infants and Toddlers (children under three years of age); Group 2 - Young Children (children between three and seven years of age); Group 3 - Juveniles and Adolescents (children between the ages of seven and 16). Numerical data and categorical variables were summarized and the normality of the distribution of data was evaluated using the Anderson-Darling normality test. Differences between the age groups were examined using either an unpaired, independent Two-Sample t-test or Unpaired Mann-Whitney U test. Pearsons chi-squared or Fishers exact tests were used to compare categorical data between groups. Results Forty total patients were included in the final analysis, 23 female (57.5%) and 17 male (42.5%). The mean age was 11  4 (range 2-16). Overall, the most common mechanism of injury was a motor vehicle collision (n=16, 40%), followed by sports injury (n=13, 32.5%), falls (n=6, 15%), and unknown mechanism (n=5, 12.5%). The most common mechanism of injury in young children was a fall (n=4, 57.5%, p<0.001). Adolescents and Juveniles significantly suffer from sports injuries compared to young children (n=13, 39.4%, p=0.043). Mechanisms of injuries presented with unique associated concomitant injuries. The most common associated sites of injuries were lower cervical spine (n=31, 77.5%), and skull injury (n=4, 10%). The vast majority of these cases were managed nonoperatively (pain medication and non-operative cervical orthosis) (n=36, 90%).

Current guidelines recommended diagnostic work-up for endocarditis among patients with S. gallolyticus bacteremia. However, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, was found to be associated with neonatal sepsis and liver diseases and is less commonly associated with endocarditis compared with S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. Our study aimed to identify the risk factors for S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus endocarditis to help select the patients for echocardiography. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, medical records from all adult patients with S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolated from blood cultures at Phramongkutklao Hospital from 2009 to 2015 were reviewed. Patients who had mixed bacteremia or missing records were excluded from the study. Results: During the study period, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was isolated among 106 individuals.

A total of 38% (n = 24) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Fifty one percent (n = 32) of patients had at least one co-morbidity with diabetes mellitus (DM) (32%; n = 20) and hypertension (32%; n = 20) as the most common co-morbidities followed by chronic heart and renal diseases (12.8%; n = 8). The most common presenting symptoms at onset of illness were fever (84%; n = 53), cough (75%; n = 47) and shortness of breaths (59%; n = 37). All except two patients (97%; n = 61) were treated with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, while the three most prescribed antibiotics were ceftriaxone (79%; n = 50), azithromycin (71%; n = 45), and the piperacillin/tazobactam combination (49%; n = 31).

DESIGN: A follow-up online survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Among the 1,600 baseline online survey participants, 388 adults were already frail, and 275 older adults did not respond to the follow-up survey. Thus, the final number of participants in this study was 937 (follow-up rate: 77.3%). METHODS: We assessed the total PA time at four time points according to the COVID-19 waves in Japan: January 2020 (before the pandemic), April 2020 (during the first wave), August 2020 (during the second wave), and January 2021 (during the third wave). We then investigated the incidence of frailty during a one-year follow-up period (during the pandemic). RESULTS: The total PA time during the first, second, and third waves of the pandemic decreased from the pre-pandemic PA time by 33.3%, 28.3%, and 40.0%, respectively. In particular, the total PA time of older adults who were living alone and socially inactive decreased significantly: 42.9% (first wave), 50.0% (second wave), and 61.9% (third wave) less than before the pandemic, respectively. Additionally, they were at a significantly higher risk of incident frailty than those who were not living alone and were socially active (adjusted odds ratio: 2.04 [95% confidence interval: 1.01C4.10]). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that older adults who live alone and are socially inactive are more likely to experience incident frailty/disability due to decreased PA during the pandemic. Understanding this mechanism may be crucial for maintaining the health status of older adults.","output":"The Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical Activity and New Incidence of Frailty among Initially Non-Frail Older Adults in Japan: A Follow-Up Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is still considered the gold standard in bariatric surgery. Before, adjustable gastric banding (AGB) was regarded as an alternative; nowadays, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a more favorable alternative. In case of unsatisfactory results, RYGB is often performed as a secondary procedure. Conversion of an AGB is associated with a high risk of complications; the hypothesis was that this would be less after conversion of an SG. METHODS All patients undergoing conversion to RYGB after AGB or SG between 2005 and 2012 were included for retrospective analysis. Patient characteristics, operative details, postoperative complications, the relief of complaints, weight loss, reasons for failure, and evolution of known comorbidities up to 2 years were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 178 patients were included (79.8 % female): AGB 110 (61.8 %) versus SG 68 (38.2 %). Main reasons for conversion were weight regain/insufficient weight loss (48.4 %) or dysphagia/reflux complaints (39.9 %). Surgical complications were found in 19 patients (AGB 13 vs SG 6; p = 0.530). Infectious complications occurred in 13 patients (AGB 11 vs SG 2; p = 0.135). Total body weight loss was equal between groups after 2 years (AGB 31.6  11.0 % vs SG 31.6  12.0 %; p = 0.998). Similar results were found in a subgroup analysis on patients undergoing conversion for additional weight loss (AGB 31.7  11.7 % vs SG 27.0  13.1 %; p = 0.173).

Hazardous RCS exposure however occurs in a wide range of occupational setting which receive less attention, in particular the construction industry. Recent outbreaks of silicosis associated with the fabrication of domestic kitchen benchtops from high-silica content artificial stone have been particularly notable because of the young age of affected workers, short duration of RCS exposure and often rapid disease progression. Developments in nanotechnology and hydraulic fracking provide further examples of how rapid changes in technology and industrial processes require governments to maintain constant vigilance to identify and control potential sources of RCS exposure.

Mean overall crude and age-specific meningococcal incidence rates were calculated to identify the target age groups that would benefit from vaccination. Over the 18-year study period, 111 out of the 245 eligible notified cases were confirmed microbiologically of which 70.3% had septicaemia, 21.6% had meningitis, and 6.3% had both. The mean overall crude incidence rate was 1.49/100,000 population with an overall case fatality rate of 12.6%. Meningococcal capsular groups (Men) B followed by C were the most prevalent with W and Y appearing over the last 6 years.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors potentially associated with participant-reported adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The COVID-19 Citizen Science Study, an online cohort study, includes adults aged 18 years and older with a smartphone or internet access. Participants complete daily, weekly, and monthly surveys on health and COVID-19Crelated events. This analysis includes participants who provided consent between March 26, 2020, and May 19, 2021, and received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose. EXPOSURES: Participant-reported COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participant-reported adverse effects and adverse effect severity. Candidate factors in multivariable logistic regression models included age, sex, race, ethnicity, subjective social status, prior COVID-19 infection, medical conditions, substance use, vaccine dose, and vaccine brand. RESULTS: The 19 586 participants had a median (IQR) age of 54 (38-66) years, and 13 420 (68.8%) were women. Allergic reaction or anaphylaxis was reported in 26 of 8680 participants (0.3%) after 1 dose of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, 27 of 11 141 (0.2%) after 2 doses of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine or 1 dose of the JNJ-78436735 (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine. The strongest factors associated with adverse effects were vaccine dose (2 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 or 1 dose of JNJ-78436735 vs 1 dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273; odds ratio [OR], 3.10; 95% CI, 2.89-3.34; P < .001), vaccine brand (mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2, OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.86-2.15; P < .001; JNJ-78436735 vs BNT162b2: OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.79; P < .001), age (per 10 years: OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72-0.76; P < .001), female sex (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.53-1.78; P < .001), and having had COVID-19 before vaccination (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.77-2.66; P < .001).

Stress is assumed to be a critical predictor of addictive SMU. However, the mechanisms underlying the association between stress and addictive SMU in crises like the current COVID-19 situation remain unclear. The present study aimed to understand the relationship between COVID-19 stress and addictive SMU by examining the mediating role of active use and social media flow (i.e., an intensive, enjoyable experience generated by SMU that perpetuates media use behaviors). A sample of 512 Chinese college students (M(age) = 22.12 years, SD = 2.47; 62.5% women) provided self-report data on COVID-19 stress and SMU variables (i.e., time, active use, flow, addictive behavior) via an online survey from March 24 to April 1, 2020. The results showed that COVID-19 stress was positively associated with tendencies toward addictive SMU. Path analyses revealed that this relationship was significantly serially mediated by active use and social media flow, with SMU time being controlled. Our findings suggest that individuals who experience more COVID-19 stress are at increased risk of addictive SMU that may be fostered by active use and flow experience. Specific attention should be paid to these high-risk populations and future interventions to reduce addictive SMU could consider targeting factors of both active use and social media flow.","output":"COVID-19 Stress and Addictive Social Media Use (SMU): Mediating Role of Active Use and Social Media Flow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCOVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China and subsequently developed into an ongoing epidemic. Understanding epidemiological factors characterising the transmission dynamics of this disease is of fundamental importance.AimsThis study aimed to describe key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.MethodsWe extracted data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from the publicly available information released by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection. We used doubly interval censored likelihood to estimate containment delay and serial interval, by fitting gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions to respective empirical values using Bayesian framework with right truncation. A generalised linear regression model was employed to identify factors associated with containment delay. Secondary attack rate was also estimated.ResultsThe empirical containment delay was 6.39 days; whereas after adjusting for right truncation with the best-fit Weibull distribution, it was 10.4 days (95% CrI: 7.15 to 19.81). Containment delay increased significantly over time. Local source of infection and number of doctor consultations before isolation were associated with longer containment delay. The empirical serial interval was 4.58-6.06 days; whereas the best-fit lognormal distribution to 26 certain-and-probable infector-infectee paired data gave an estimate of 4.77 days (95% CrI: 3.47 to 6.90) with right-truncation. The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%.ConclusionWith a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement.

Increased lethality in men was evident in the first large reports from ChinaCDC and WHO-China, and the gender gap appeared even wider in the early Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals alike have commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and gender role behavior differences that may underlie it. However, as for other diseases, and in spite of years of advocating for the collection of raw epidemiological data and the analysis of clinical trial data sets by sex, very little appeared to be released about sex differences in characteristics of the epidemics beyond infection and death rates, such as severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These data are critical not only for scientists to understand the pathophysiology of disease, but also to inform decision-making by countries and healthcare systems on how to prioritize testing and best allocate scarce resources and relief funds. Systematic analysis of official websites for the 20 countries and 6 US states reporting the highest number of cases on March 21, 2020, revealed a wide disparity in sex-disaggregated data made available to the public and scholars. Only a handful of the countries reported cases by sex separately. None of the other characteristics, including fatality rates, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, our analysis found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information. Our analysis revealed a wide range of sex ratios among confirmed cases, which changed over time. In countries where a male-biased sex ratio was initially reported, the reported proportion of women among cases dramatically increased in under 3 weeks. In contrast, men were consistently over-represented in severe cases, intensive care admissions, and deaths. We also show that the sex ratio varies with age, with a complex pattern, reproduced across the 6 countries for which data were found. Accurate, peer-reviewed, statistical analysis of harmonized, sex-disaggregated data for other characteristics of epidemics, such as availability of testing, suspected source of infection, or comorbidities will be critical to understand where the observed disparities come from and to generate evidence-based recommendations for decision-making by institutions and governments around the world.","output":"Paucity and disparity of publicly available sex-disaggregated data for the COVID-19 epidemic hamper evidence-based decision-making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tocilizumab has been reported to attenuate the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.

Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], -49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (95.1% of 41 with sequencing data) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, -76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.

Objectives: To assess whether rs35705950-T confers differential risk for clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection among participants in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI). Methods: MVP participants were examined for an association between the incidence or severity of COVID-19 and the presence of a MUC5B rs35705950-T allele. Comorbidities and clinical events were extracted from the electronic health records (EHR). The analysis was performed within each ancestry group in the MVP, adjusting for sex, age, age2, and first twenty principal components followed by a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We then pursued replication and performed a meta-analysis with the trans-ethnic summary statistics from the HGI. A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of the rs35705950-T was conducted to explore associated pathophysiologic conditions.

METHODS Paraffin-embedded sections of the temporal cortex, motor cortex, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and midbrain tectum from 1020 PSP and 199 CBD cases were assessed by phospho-tau immunohistochemistry. The severity of tau lesions (i.e., neurofibrillary tangle, coiled body, tufted astrocyte or astrocytic plaque, and tau threads) was semi-quantitatively scored in each region. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using tau pathology scores. A decision tree classifier was made by tau pathology scores using 914 cases. Cross-validation was done using 305 cases. An additional ten cases were used for a validation study. RESULTS Cluster analysis displayed two distinct clusters; the first cluster included only CBD, and the other cluster included all PSP and six CBD cases. We built a decision tree, which used only seven decision nodes. The scores of tau threads in the caudate nucleus were the most decisive factor for predicting CBD. In a cross-validation, 302 out of 305 cases were correctly diagnosed. In the pilot validation study, three investigators made a correct diagnosis in all cases using the decision tree. CONCLUSION Regardless of the morphology of astrocytic tau lesions, semi-quantitative tau pathology scores in select brain regions are sufficient to distinguish PSP and CBD.

MethodsAll SARS-CoV-2-positive adults in Iceland were prospectively enrolled into a telehealth service at diagnosis. A multivariable proportional-odds logistic regression model was derived from information obtained during the enrollment interview with those diagnosed before May 1, 2020 and validated in those diagnosed between May 1 and December 31, 2020. Outcomes were defined on an ordinal scale; no need for escalation of care during follow-up, need for outpatient visit, hospitalization, and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Risk factors were summarized as odds ratios (OR) adjusted for confounders identified by a directed acyclic graph. ResultsThe prognostic model was derived from and validated in 1,625 and 3,131 individuals, respectively. In total, 375 (7.9%) only required outpatient visits, 188 (4.0%) were hospitalized and 50 (1.1%) were either admitted to ICU or died due to complications of COVID-19. The model included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), current smoking, underlying conditions, and symptoms and clinical severity score at enrollment. Discrimination and calibration were excellent for outpatient visit or worse (C-statistic 0.75, calibration intercept 0.04 and slope 0.93) and hospitalization or worse (C-statistic 0.81, calibration intercept 0.16 and slope 1.03).

METHODS: Fourth-year medical students matched into a surgical internship attended a 2-hour class virtually. The class provided suggestions for building rapport and earning trust with patients and families by video, role play sessions with a simulated patient, and group debriefing and feedback. A group debriefing generated lessons learned and best practices for telemedicine communication in surgery. RESULTS: Students felt the class introduced new skills and reinforced current ones; most reported higher self-confidence in target communication skills following the module.

The understanding of the transmission and the duration of viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the timeframe and potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to antibody response. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study of 36 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Karolinska University Hospital. Patients with more than 8 days of symptom duration were sampled from airways, for PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and in vitro culture of replicating virus. Serum SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies titers were assessed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and microneutralization assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in airway samples in 23 patients (symptom duration median 15 days, range 9-53 days), whereas 13 patients were SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative (symptom duration median 21 days, range 10-37 days). Replicating virus was detected in samples from 4 patients at 9-16 days. All but two patients had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in serum, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in 33 out of 36 patients. Total SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated. High levels of both total IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in patients sampled later after symptom onset and in patients where replicating virus could not be detected.

It remains unclear what strategies facilitate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion. OBJECTIVE Our aim is to conduct a scoping review to investigate user engagement strategies and methods to evaluate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion in adults. METHODS This scoping review adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews. The search was conducted in 7 electronic databases from inception to April 2020. The inclusion criteria for studies were as follows: adult (aged 18 years) users of digital interventions for mental health promotion from the general population; any digital intervention for mental health promotion; and user engagement strategies described in the intervention design. We extracted the following data items: study characteristics, digital intervention (type and engagement strategy), evaluation of engagement strategy (method and result specifying whether the strategy was effective at facilitating engagement), and features of engagement (extent of use and subjective experience of users). RESULTS A total of 2766 studies were identified, of which 16 (0.58%) met the inclusion criteria. The 16 studies included randomized controlled trials (6/16, 37%), studies analyzing process data (5/16, 31%), observational studies (3/16, 19%), and qualitative studies (2/16, 13%). The digital interventions for mental health promotion were either web based (12/16, 75%) or mobile app based (4/16, 25%). The engagement strategies included personalized feedback about intervention content or users' mental health status; guidance regarding content and progress through e-coaching; social forums, and interactivity with peers; content gamification; reminders; and flexibility and ease of use. These engagement strategies were deemed effective based on qualitative user feedback or responses on questionnaires or tools (4/16, 25%), usability data (5/16, 31%), or both (7/16, 44%). Most studies identified personalized support in the form of e-coaching, peer support through a social platform, personalized feedback, or joint videoconference sessions as an engaging feature. CONCLUSIONS Personalized support during the intervention, access to social support, and personalized feedback seem to promote engagement with digital interventions for mental health promotion. These findings need to be interpreted with caution because the included studies were heterogeneous, had small sample sizes, and typically did not address engagement as the primary outcome.

OBJECTIVES To describe the clinical presentation and outcomes of a cohort of women with high-risk pregnancies with confirmed COVID-19 to determine whether risk factors for disease severity and adverse outcomes of COVID-19 differed in pregnant women without HIV compared with PLHIV. METHODS We prospectively enrolled pregnant women with COVID-19 attending the high-risk obstetric service at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, from 1 May to 31 July 2020, with follow-up until 31 October 2020. Women were considered high risk if they required specialist care for maternal, neonatal and/or anaesthetic conditions. Common maternal or obstetric conditions included hypertensive disorders, morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) 40 kg/m2) and diabetes. Information on demographics, clinical features, and maternal and neonatal outcomes was collected and compared for PLHIV v. pregnant women without HIV. RESULTS One hundred women (72 without HIV and 28 PLHIV) with high-risk pregnancies had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Among the 28 PLHIV, the median (interquartile range) CD4 count was 441 (317 - 603) cells/L, and 19/26 (73%) were virologically suppressed. COVID-19 was diagnosed predominantly in the third trimester (81%). Obesity (BMI 30 in n=61/81; 75%) and hypertensive disorders were frequent comorbidities. Of the 100 women, 40% developed severe or critical COVID-19, 15% required intensive care unit admission and 6% needed invasive ventilation. Eight women died, 1 from advanced HIV disease complicated by bacteraemia and urosepsis. The crude maternal mortality rate was substantially higher in women with COVID-19 compared with all other deliveries at our institution during this period (8/91 (9%) v. 7/4 058 (0.2%); p<0.001). Neonatal outcomes were favourable. No significant differences in COVID-19 risk factors, disease severity, and maternal/neonatal outcome were noted for PLHIV v. those without HIV. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of high-risk pregnant women, the impact of COVID-19 was severe, significantly increasing maternal mortality risk compared with baseline rates. Virally suppressed HIV infection was not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in pregnancy.","output":"Maternal and neonatal outcomes of COVID-19 in a high-risk pregnant cohort with and without HIV."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sharp decline in employment after the COVID-19 lockdown was not uniformly felt across demographic groups. Utilizing the 2017 to 2020 monthly Current Population Survey and using a difference-in-difference design, we investigate the varying impacts of COVID-19 on at-work status among the prime-working-age population, accounting for typical seasonal fluctuations in employment. The target population is grouped by gender, marital status, parenthood, and level of education. Our results uncover complex variations by gender, marital status, and childrens age. Contrary to popular belief, married women without school-aged children did not experience a relative decline in employment compared to married fathers. A majority of disadvantages in employment that married women experienced are accounted for by controlling for typical seasonal fluctuations. The women whose employment was most distinctively adversely affected by COVID-19 during 2020 were less-educated never-married childless women and never-married mothers. Less-educated men who were not currently married also experienced a disadvantage in employment relative to equally educated married fathers. These findings imply that, during the pandemic recession, marriage offered a form of within-family insurance that we call the added caregiver effect. The further implications of these findings are discussed.","output":"Who is the She in the Pandemic She-Cession?

However, potential factors that may explain the different spatial distributions remain unexplored. We use boosted regression tree (BRT) models to explore the association of agro-ecological, environmental and meteorological variables with the occurrence of human cases of H7N9 and H5N1, and map the probabilities of occurrence of human cases. Live poultry markets, density of human, coverage of built-up land, relative humidity and precipitation were significant predictors for both. In addition, density of poultry, coverage of shrub and temperature played important roles for human H7N9 infection, whereas human H5N1 infection was associated with coverage of forest and water body. Based on the risks and distribution of ecological characteristics which may facilitate the circulation of the two viruses, we found Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, along with a few spots on the southeast coastline, to be the high risk areas for H7N9 and H5N1. Additional, H5N1 risk spots were identified in eastern Sichuan and southern Yunnan Provinces. Surveillance of the two viruses needs to be enhanced in these high risk areas to reduce the risk of future epidemics of avian influenza in China.","output":"Risk Distribution of Human Infections with Avian Influenza H7N9 and H5N1 virus in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic respiratory disease.

The association between obesity and a wide range of viruses was assessed using VirScan, a pan-viral serological profiling tool. Serum specimens from 457 Qatari adults (lean = 184; obese = 273) and 231 Qatari children (lean = 111; obese = 120) were analyzed by VirScan. Associations with obesity were determined by odds ratio (OR) and Fishers test (p values), and by multivariate regression analysis to adjust for age and gender. Although there was no association of viral infections with obesity in the pediatric population, a nominal association of obesity with seropositivity to members of the Herpesviridae family is observed for the adult population (OR = 1.5C3.3; p < 0.05). After adjusting p values for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction) the odds of being obese is significantly higher in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) seropositive Qatari adults (OR = 3.3; 95% CI 2.15C4.99; p = 2.787E ? 08). By VirScan, the sero-prevalence of HSV1 is 81.3% and 57.1% among Qatari obese and lean adult populations, respectively. Higher prevalence of antibodies against several peptide epitopes of HSV-1/2 is positively associated with obesity (OR = 2.35C3.82; p  3.981E ? 05). By multivariate regression analysis, HSV-1 was independently associated with obesity irrespective of age and gender. Our results suggest that obesity among Qataris may be associated with a higher prevalence of herpesvirus infections, in particular HSV-1. Furthermore, the high prevalence of antibodies against peptide antigens specific to HSV-1 and -2 in the obese population suggests that these viral peptides may play a role in adipogenesis. Further studies with these candidate peptides in cell culture or animal models may confirm their adipogenic roles.","output":"Virome-wide serological profiling reveals association of herpesviruses with obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The world, and Italy on the front lines, is experiencing a major medical emergency due to the SARSCoV-2 outbreak Cancer patients are one of the potentially most vulnerable cohorts of people, but data about their management are still limited Patients and methods: In this monocentric retrospective study we included all SARS-CoV-2 oncological patients accepted at the Onco-COVID Unit at San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, one of the few oncological departments dedicated to cancer patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection in Italy Clinical data were obtained from medical records available until April 24th, 2020 Results: 20 cancer patients were included The mean (SD) age of the patients was 6614 years, 80% were men Eight (40%) developed infection in their communities and 12 (60%) during the hospitalization Lung cancer was the most frequent type of cancer (12, 60%), followed by blood/bone marrow cancer (3, 15%) Eight patients (40%) were symptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of diagnosis and symptoms began 2 (2) days before The most common were shortness of breath and diarrhea Fever was present in 7 patients (35%) Among the 12 asymptomatic patients, 8 (67%) became symptomatic during the hospitalization (mean time of symptoms onset 4 days + 4) C-reactive protein increase was detected in 15 (75%) patients, high lactate dehydrogenase levels in 13 (65%), lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia in 6 (30%) and 4 (20%), respectively Seven patients (35%) were on active anti-tumor treatment, 3 (43%) received anti-tumor therapy within two weeks before SARSCoV-2 positivity, and 2 (29%) continued oncological treatment (TKIs and chemotherapy) after the infection diagnosis Nine (45%) patients were prescribed hydroxychloroquine and 5 (25%) antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir Ten (50%) patients died within a mean of 11 days (+ 8) from the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection Five patients (25%) have been discharged from the hospital, 4 (20%) of them with the indication to best supportive care and 1(5%) to active antitumor treatment Conclusions: Our series confirms the high mortality rate among cancer patients with COVID-19 The presence of asymptomatic cases suggests that typical symptoms and fever may not be the only useful parameters to suspect COVID-19 in oncological patients Our Onco-Covid unit suggests the importance of a tailored and holistic approach for cancer patients, even in a challenging situation like SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","output":"Sars-cov-2 infection in cancer patients: A picture of an Italian onco-covid unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in randomised-controlled trials and large experimental studies has been demonstrated in university student populations. Whilst these investigations have provided insight into the nature of the delivery of mindfulness-based practices, there has been little research in the implementation of self-managed online student wellbeing and mindfulness programs at university. This ecological validation study conducted in 2020 evaluated a real-world implementation of a large, university-wide, online mindfulness-based program that was accessible fully online via the tertiary institutions Learning Management System (LMS) student orientation site. The total sample included 833 participants from a range of disciplines and faculties at Monash University, Australia. At the end of the study, 236 (28.3%) participants were retained and completed the follow-up survey. Participants had the option to engage with the fully self-managed online mindfulness program for a 12-week semester. The mindfulness practices were pre-recorded, audio-guided sessions, and 10C15 min in length. Baseline and end of semester questionnaires included the 14-item Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, 10-item Perceived Stress Scale and the 18-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. Participants who engaged with the mindfulness program over 3 or more weeks showed significant improvements in all three outcome measures, and all participants showed significant improvements in wellbeing at the end of semester. Learning analytics obtained via the LMS revealed that 58.6% (n = 489) had not logged into the mindfulness program at all, almost a third (31.0%, n = 259) logged into the program materials once or twice, and 10.2% (n = 85) of the whole sample engaged with the program actively, having logged in three or more times. The total number of student logins peaked in week 2, reduced between week 2 and week 7 and thereafter activity remained stable until the end of the semester. We hypothesise that the changes in wellbeing, stress and mindfulness at the end of the semester seen in the low engagement participants may partly be explained by the circumstances of COVID-19 restrictions improving.

Historically, the majority of cases were attributed to cerebral malaria (CM). With the recent drastic reduction in malaria incidence, non-malarial coma is becoming a larger proportion of cases and determining the aetiology is diagnostically challenging, particularly in resource-limited settings. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the aetiology and prognosis of non-traumatic coma in African children. METHODS: With no date restrictions, systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus will identify prospective and retrospective studies (including randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials, cohort studies, cross-sectional, and case-control studies) recruiting children (1 monthC16 years) with non-traumatic coma (defined by Blantyre Coma Score  2 or comparable alternative) from any African country. Disease-specific studies will be included if coma is associated and reported. The primary outcome is to determine the aetiology (infectious and non-infectious) of non-traumatic coma in African children, with pooled prevalence estimates of causes (e.g., malaria). Secondary outcomes are to determine overall estimates of morbidity and mortality of all-cause non-traumatic coma and disease-specific states of non-traumatic coma, where available. Random effects meta-analysis will summarise aetiology data and in-hospital and post-discharge mortality. Heterogeneity will be quantified with (2), I(2), and Cochrans Q test.

All trials were repeated to ensure accuracy. RESULTS The CO2 laser ignited a fire when contacting a non-reinforced ETT in under 2 seconds at oxygen concentrations as low as 44%. The CO2 laser could not ignite a laser safe ETT under any conditions, unless it struck the non-reinforced distal tip of the ETT. With the RFA, a fire could not be ignited with either reinforced or non-reinforced ETTs. CONCLUSIONS RFA presents no risk of ignition in simulated airway surgery. CO2 lasers should be utilized with a reinforced ETT or no ETT, as fires can easily ignite when lasers strike a non-reinforced ETT.

They emphasized the provision of required economic and social resources worldwide. Past literature related to COVID-19 has contributed little evidence to examine the efficacy of full and partial lockdown measures with experimental perspectives at different intervals. This study bridges this literature gap and explores the full and smart lockdowns' impacts on Pakistani students' mental health, depression, quality of life, and anxiety symptoms, during the various waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This pretest and posttest experimental designed web-based survey recruited 40 students from March 23 to August 23, 2020, and recorded their responses. The study incorporated four standardized psychological instruments to receive the desired datasets related to students' mental health, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Researchers shared data links with the participants via social media, WhatsApp. The study applied one-way and multivariate ANOVA tests (analysis of variance) to draw the desired results. RESULTS: This study's findings suggest that both full and partial COVID-19 lockdowns effectively improve students' mental health and quality of life. These measures help reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms among university students. The study results exhibit that partial lockdown (PL) is more effective in improving quality of life. Besides, PL helps reduce anxiety symptoms than complete lockdown among Pakistani students. CONCLUSION: The present study's findings suggest that students are vulnerable. They need particular interventions and preventive measures to protect and improve their mental health and quality of life during a global pandemic. As the stressful experience of the epidemic persists in Pakistan.

METHODS: Two cohorts were used for the two different aims. 1980 COVID-19 patients were enrolled for the aim of prediction ofMV. 1036 patients' data, including demographics, past smoking and drinking history, past medical history and vital signs at emergency room (ER), laboratory values, and treatments were collected for training and 674 patients were enrolled for validation using XGBoost algorithm. For the second aim to predict in-hospital mortality, 3491 hospitalized patients via ER were enrolled. CatBoost, a new gradient-boosting algorithm was applied for training and validation of the cohort. RESULTS: Older age, higher temperature, increased respiratory rate (RR) and a lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) from the first set of vital signs were associated with an increased risk of MV amongst the 1980 patients in the ER. The model had a high accuracy of 86.2% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87.8%. While, patients who required MV, had a higher RR, Body mass index (BMI) and longer length of stay in the hospital were the major features associated with in-hospital mortality.

Stakeholders were traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) experts, Western medicine (WM) experts, nurses, and the public. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were also invited to participate in a questionnaire written in understandable language. Then different stakeholders participated in a consensus meeting by video conference to vote. RESULTS: Ninety-seven eligible study protocols were identified from 160 clinical trials. Seventy-six outcomes were identified from TCM clinical trials and 126 outcomes were identified from WM clinical trials. Finally, 145 outcomes were included in the first round of the Delphi survey. Then, a COS for clinical trials of TCM and WM was developed. The COS included clinical outcomes (recovery/improvement/progression/death), etiology (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid tests, viral load), inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein), vital signs (temperature, respiration), blood and lymphatic-system parameters (lymphocytes, virus antibody), respiratory outcomes (pulmonary imaging, blood oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, arterial blood gas analysis, mechanical ventilation, oxygen intake, pneumonia severity index), clinical efficacy (prevalence of preventing patients with mild-to-moderate disease progressing to severe disease), and symptoms (clinical symptom score). Outcomes were recommended according to different types of disease. Outcome measurement instruments/definitions were also recommended.

Private contact tracing (PCT) is one of the promising techniques for the purpose. However, the recently proposed Bluetooth-based PCT has several limitations in terms of functionality and flexibility. The existing systems are only able to detect direct contact (i.e., human-human contact), but cannot detect indirect contact (i.e., human-object, such as the disease transmission through surface). Moreover, the rule of risky contact cannot be flexibly changed with the environmental situation and the nature of the virus. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient trajectory-based PCT system using trusted hardware. We formalize trajectory-based PCT as a generalization of the well-studied Private Set Intersection (PSI), which is mostly based on cryptographic primitives and thus insufficient. We solve the problem by leveraging trusted hardware such as Intel SGX and designing a novel algorithm to achieve a secure, efficient and flexible PCT system. Our experiments on real-world data show that the proposed system can achieve high performance and scalability.

Methods: We conducted a sub-analysis from the international Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation Registry for COVID-19 (HOPE-COVID-19-Registry, NCT04334291). Out of 5,837 patients with COVID-19, 624 patients were diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 International Consensus. Results: In multivariable analysis, the following risk factors were identified as independent predictors for developing sepsis: current smoking, tachypnoea (>22 breath per minute), hemoptysis, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) <92%, blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP <90 mmHg and diastolic BP <60 mmHg), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15, elevated procalcitonin (PCT), elevated troponin I (TnI), and elevated creatinine >1.5 mg/dl. By assigning odds ratio (OR) weighted points to these variables, the following three risk categories were defined to develop sepsis during admission: low-risk group (probability of sepsis 3.1C11.8%); intermediate-risk group (24.8C53.8%); and high-risk-group (58.3C100%). A score of 1 was assigned to current smoking, tachypnoea, decreased SpO(2), decreased BP, decreased GCS, elevated PCT, TnI, and creatinine, whereas a score of 2 was assigned to hemoptysis. Conclusions: The HOPE Sepsis Score including nine parameters is useful in identifying high-risk COVID-19 patients to develop sepsis. Sepsis in COVID-19 is associated with a high mortality rate.","output":"Sepsis of Patients Infected by SARS-CoV-2: Real-World Experience From the International HOPE-COVID-19-Registry and Validation of HOPE Sepsis Score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to treat oncologic diseases is progressively increasing. Computed tomography (CT) features of ICI therapy-related pneumonitis may overlap with other diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, oncologic patients undergoing ICI therapy and developing pneumonitis are at risk of being misdiagnosed. Exploring the strengths and weaknesses of artificial intelligence in distinguishing between ICI therapy-related pneumonitis and COVID-19 is of great importance for oncologic patients and for clinicians in order to increase awareness on this topic and stimulate novel strategies aimed to promptly and correctly classify and treat this category of vulnerable patients. ABSTRACT: Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy-related pneumonitis share common features. The aim of this study was to determine on chest computed tomography (CT) images whether a deep convolutional neural network algorithm is able to solve the challenge of differential diagnosis between COVID-19 pneumonia and ICI therapy-related pneumonitis. Methods: We enrolled three groups: a pneumonia-free group (n = 30), a COVID-19 group (n = 34), and a group of patients with ICI therapy-related pneumonitis (n = 21). Computed tomography images were analyzed with an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on a deep convolutional neural network structure. Statistical analysis included the MannCWhitney U test (significance threshold at p < 0.05) and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). Results: The algorithm showed low specificity in distinguishing COVID-19 from ICI therapy-related pneumonitis (sensitivity 97.1%, specificity 14.3%, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.62). ICI therapy-related pneumonitis was identified by the AI when compared to pneumonia-free controls (sensitivity = 85.7%, specificity 100%, AUC = 0.97). Conclusions: The deep learning algorithm is not able to distinguish between COVID-19 pneumonia and ICI therapy-related pneumonitis. Awareness must be increased among clinicians about imaging similarities between COVID-19 and ICI therapy-related pneumonitis. ICI therapy-related pneumonitis can be applied as a challenge population for cross-validation to test the robustness of AI models used to analyze interstitial pneumonias of variable etiology.","output":"Deep Learning Algorithm Trained with COVID-19 Pneumonia Also Identifies Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy-Related Pneumonitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: While many organizations endorse screening for social risk factors in clinical settings, few studies have examined the health and utilization effects of interventions to address social needs. OBJECTIVE: To compare the acute care utilization effects of a written resources handout vs an in-person navigation service intervention to address social needs. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, 1809 adult caregivers of pediatric patients seen in primary and urgent care clinics of 2 safety-net hospitals in northern California were recruited between October 13, 2013, and August 27, 2015. Each participating family was randomly assigned to an in-person navigator intervention vs active control to address the familys social needs. Analyses were conducted between February 28, 2018, and September 25, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Caregivers either received written information about relevant local resources related to social needs (active control) or met with a patient navigator focused on helping them resolve social needs (navigator intervention). After an initial in-person visit, navigation services included telephone, email, and/or in-person follow-up for up to 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Child emergency department visit or hospitalization within 12 months of study enrollment. RESULTS: Among the 1300 caregivers enrolled in the study without missing follow-up data, most spoke English (878 [67.5%]) and were women (1127 [86.7%]), with a mean (SD) age of 33.0 (9.33) years. Most children were aged 0 to 5 years (779 of 1300 [59.9%]), 723 children (55.6%) had Hispanic ethnicity, and 462 children (35.5%) were in excellent health; 840 families (64.6%) were recruited from urgent care. In total, 637 families (49.0%) were randomized to the in-person navigator group and 663 (51.0%) to the active control group. There was no difference in risk of an emergency department visit between the 2 groups. Children enrolled in the in-person navigator group had a decreased risk of hospitalization within 12 months (hazard ratio, 0.59; 05% CI, 0.38-0.94; P = .03), making them 69% less likely to be hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial evaluating heath care utilization effects of programs designed to address social needs among families, children enrolled in the navigation group were significantly less likely to be hospitalized after the intervention but equally likely to have an emergency department visit. These findings strengthen our understanding of the effects of addressing social needs in clinical settings as part of a comprehensive strategy to improve health and reduce health care utilization.

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed institutional data of consecutive stroke procedures in patients with LVO in the anterior circulation that were treated between January 2017 and December 2017 with the Aperio. Reperfusion rate regarding to the extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale (eTICI), procedural times, early clinical outcome, and complications were documented. RESULTS Eighty-two patients were treated by using the Aperio in LVO in the anterior circulation. Median age was 77 ( 12) years (w = 59.8%). Median Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14. Fifty-three (64.6%) patients received intravenous thrombolysis. Successful recanalization (eTICI2b) was achieved in 85.3%. Mean time from groin puncture to final recanalization was 52.3  34.8 min. Embolization to new territories occurred in one case. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 h was observed in six patients (7.3%).

Responses to the checklists of demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, and behavior toward patients with COVID-19 were analyzed by SPSS 22.Results 191 subjects (118 females and 73 males) with a mean age of 34.7  8.6 years participated in this study. The level of knowledge of HCWs in this study was excellent regarding the ways of transmitting the disease such as close contact with the patient with suspected Coronavirus (99%). According to their positions, participants had a significant difference in their knowledge of asymptomatic patients (P < 0.001). The study found that 14% of the HCWs did not have the necessary knowledge about the symptoms of COVID-19, indicating poor knowledge of the HCWs at the beginning of the disease epidemic. The results obtained from the evaluation of HCWs attitudes showed that some workers believed that protective and preventive measures should only be applied when managing people with severe symptoms (P < 0.001). Finally, there was a significant difference in behavior and adherence to protective and preventive measures between the participants when facing patients with severe symptoms and without symptoms of COVID-19 (P = 0.05).Conclusion Knowledge, attitude, and behavior toward COVID-19 infection and facing patients with severe and overt symptoms among health care workers in the hospital were Excellent, but these were insufficient for patients without obvious symptoms.

AIMS: We investigated the association of exposure to the virus, COVID-19-related discrimination and stigma with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a culturally diverse sample of adults in Quebec (Canada). METHOD: A total of 3273 residents of the province of Quebec (49% aged 18-39 years, 57% women, 51% belonging to a minority ethno-cultural group) completed an online survey. We used linear and ordinal logistic regression to identify the relationship between COVID-19 experiences and mental health, and the moderating role of ethno-cultural identity. RESULTS: Mental health varied significantly based on socioeconomic status and ethno-cultural group, with those with lower incomes and Arab participants reporting higher psychological distress. Exposure to the virus, COVID-19-related discrimination, and stigma were associated with poorer mental health. Associations with mental health varied across ethno-cultural groups, with exposed and discriminated Black participants reporting higher mental distress. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate sociocultural inequalities in mental health related to COVID-19 in the Canadian context. COVID-19-related risk factors, including exposure, discrimination and stigma, jeopardise mental health. This burden is most noteworthy for the Black community.

In this context, it is very important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize propagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained momentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of nodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality measures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this study, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of nodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model and only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes according to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm is named the Expected Value Estimation (EVE). We compared the performance of EVE, using different SIR settings on real datasets, with that of many current well-known centrality measures.

In animal experiments, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are reported to suppress the downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and they may inhibit the worsening of pathological conditions. We aimed to examine whether preceding use of ACEIs and ARBs affected the clinical manifestations and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. One hundred fifty-one consecutive patients (mean age 60  19 years) with polymerase-chain-reaction proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were admitted to six hospitals in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, were analyzed in this multicenter retrospective observational study. Among all COVID-19 patients, in the multiple regression analysis, older age (age  65 years) was significantly associated with the primary composite outcome (odds ratio (OR) 6.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.28-22.78, P < 0.001), which consisted of (i) in-hospital death, (ii) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (iii) mechanical ventilation, including invasive and noninvasive methods, and (iv) admission to the intensive care unit. In COVID-19 patients with hypertension, preceding ACEI/ARB use was significantly associated with a lower occurrence of new-onset or worsening mental confusion (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.002-0.69, P = 0.02), which was defined by the confusion criterion, which included mild disorientation or hallucination with an estimation of medical history of mental status, after adjustment for age, sex, and diabetes.

Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality. However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis. Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality. We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans. In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system. We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality. A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age. We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk. Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.","output":"Higher mortality of COVID-19 in males: sex differences in immune response and cardiovascular comorbidities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Current knowledge on the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in COVID\\\\19 remains limited to small series and registry data.

METHODS: Between October 2013 and December 2016, adults with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing standardised NCRT and surgery were recruited to a multi-centre trial. Patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and completed HRQoL questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L) pre-NCRT and post-NCRT (week 0/baseline). At week 0, patients were randomised to exercise prehabilitation or usual care (no intervention). CPET and HRQoL questionnaires were assessed at week 0, 3, 6 and 9, whilst semi-structured interviews were assessed at week 0 and week 9. Changes in oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (VO(2) at AT (ml kg(?1) min(?1))) between groups were compared using linear mixed modelling. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were recruited, mean age 64 (10.4) years. Of the 38 patients, 33 were randomised: 16 to usual care and 17 to exercise prehabilitation (26 males and 7 females). Exercise prehabilitation significantly improved VO(2) at AT at week 9 compared to the usual care.

Design/methodology/approach Scopus was used as the search engine for this review. Papers which reported findings related to ABW and performed field study in ABW workspaces with adult occupants were included. Out of the 442 initial papers, 40 papers were included following iterative title and and full text review process and consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria. These papers were divided into three groupings (organizational, human and physical environment) based on their major focus. Positive and negative effects of ABW environments on occupants are discussed within these three topics in consideration of the implications for the post-COVID workplace. Findings Although the included studies were inclined to be either more positive (i.e. interior design) or negative (i.e. indoor environmental quality, productivity, distraction and privacy) in relation to various attributes of ABW, no single effect of ABW environments on occupants was in full agreement between the studies. The shortcomings of ABW environments are more related to how this way of working is implemented and how occupants use it, rather than the concept itself. A partial uptake of ABW leads to occupants' dissatisfaction, lower productivity and lower well-being, while a holistic approach increases the chance of success. It is hypothesised that many currently reported negative aspects of the ABW concept might diminish overtime as ABW evolves and as new challenges arise. A continuous post-occupancy evaluation after relocation to an ABW-supportive environment can inform the organization about the changing needs and preference of the occupants;hence, the organization can tailor the ABW solution to the arising needs. The inter-connection between the three key ABW pillars (organizational, human and physical environment) is crucial to the success of this concept specifically in the context of the post-COVID-19 workplace.

At the time of diagnosis of lymphoma, 13 cases were stage I (9%), 27 (18%) stage II, 37 (24.5%) stage III, and 73 (48.5%) stage IV, while 6.6% had a primary extranodal origin. A total of 10 cases with positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, which is a prevalence of 6% in this population. None of the patients required intensive care unit management and all fully recovered from the infection. Conclusion: IgG antibody seroprevalence in lymphoma patients appears similar to that of the general population and does not show greater aggressiveness.","output":"Multicenter Study of the Seroprevalence of Antibodies against Covid-19 in Patients with Lymphoma: An Analysis of the Oncological Group for the Treatment and Study of Lymphomas (Gotel)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The growing understanding of the oppressive inequities that exist in postsecondary education has led to an increasing need for culturally relevant pedagogy. Researchers have found evidence that beliefs about the nature of knowledge predict pedagogical practices. Culturally relevant pedagogy supports students in ways that leverage students own cultures through three tenets: academic success, cultural competence, and sociopolitical consciousness. If STEM practitioners believe that their disciplines are culture-free, they may not enact culturally relevant pedagogy in their courses. We investigated how and in what forms 40 faculty from mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology departments at Hispanic-Serving Institutions enacted culturally relevant pedagogy. We used the framework of practical rationality to understand how epistemological beliefs about the nature of their discipline combined with their institutional context impacted instructors decision to enact practices aligning with the three tenets of culturally relevant pedagogy. RESULTS: In total, 35 instructors reported using practices that aligned with the academic success tenet, nine instructors with the cultural competence tenet, and one instructor with the sociopolitical consciousness tenet. Instructors expressed and even lauded their disciplines separation from culture while simultaneously expressing instructional decisions that aligned with culturally relevant pedagogy. Though never asked directly, six instructors made statements reflecting a culture-free belief about knowledge in their discipline such as To me, mathematics has no color. Five of those instructors also described altering their teaching in ways that aligned with the academic success tenet. The framework of practical rationality helped explain how the instructors individual obligation (to the needs of individual students) and interpersonal obligation (to the social environment of the classroom) played a role in those decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Instructors ability to express two contradictory views may indicate that professional development does not have to change an instructors epistemological beliefs about their discipline to convince them of the value of enacting culturally relevant pedagogy. We propose departmental changes that could enable instructors to decide to cultivate students cultural competence and sociopolitical consciousness. Our findings highlight the need for future research investigating the impacts of culturally relevant pedagogical content knowledge on students experiences.","output":"The role of epistemological beliefs in STEM facultys decisions to use culturally relevant pedagogy at Hispanic-Serving Institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The supply limitations of COVID-19 vaccines have led to the need to prioritize vaccine distribution.

Many studies of this type focus on generating the desired future, taking into account the fact that it is accompanied by uncertainty. The author of this publication postulates treating uncertainty as an equivalentin relation to the futureresearch object. This approach allows us to formulate general assumptions for a model of the anticipatory management of systemic uncertainty in IoT networks. The goal of such a model will not be to eliminate or even minimize uncertainty, but to regulate it to a desired level. Such an action can bring many more benefits than trying to zero out uncertainty. On the general side, uncertainty can be studied in two ways: (1) as an abstract idea, or (2) as a feature of a particular structure, also with elements of research on its abstract component. In this paper the attention is focused on the second approach. The main research area is the IoT network in its broadest sense, with a particular role of the social construct, in the context of the study of systemic uncertainty in relation to selected anticipatory actions.

Use of corticosteroids was harmful in other coronavirus infections previously. WHO recommended against routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. In view of these, we reviewed the evidence about the use of corticosteroids in virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Corticosteroids are beneficial in ARDS regardless of etiology. However, they increased the mortality rate in influenza-associated ARDS. In SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, corticosteroids increased the mortality, delayed the viral clearance and increased the length of hospital stay. In the case of COVID-19, the available evidence from retrospective and observational studies is inconclusive about the corticosteroid use. Low-dose therapies appear to be effective. Evidence from a randomized control study found dexamethasone is effective in decreasing mortality in severe COVID-19 cases.

However, in comparison to the host population, these populations are less likely to use mental health services. Digital mental health approaches have been shown to be effective in improving well-being for the general population. Thus, they may provide an effective and culturally appropriate strategy to bridge the treatment gap for these populations vulnerable to mental health risks. OBJECTIVE This paper aims to provide the background and rationale for conducting a scoping review on digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants. It also provides an outline of the methods and analyses, which will be used to answer the following questions. What are the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants? Are they effective, feasible, appropriate, and accepted by the population? What are the knowledge gaps in the field? METHODS The scoping review methodology will follow 5 phases: identifying the research question; identifying relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Searches will be conducted in the following databases: EBSCOhost databases (CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE with Full Text, APA PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and APA PsycInfo), PubMed, and Scopus. Additionally, OpenGrey, Mednar, and Eldis will be searched for gray literature. All primary studies and gray literature in English concerning the use of information and communication technology to deliver services addressing mental health issues for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants will be included. RESULTS This scoping review will provide an overview of the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants and describe the implementation outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of such approaches for those populations. Potential gaps in the field will also be identified. CONCLUSIONS As of February 2020, there were no scoping reviews, which assessed the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants. This review will provide an extensive coverage on a promising and innovative intervention for such populations. It will give insight into the range of approaches, their effectiveness, and progress in their implementation. It will also provide valuable information for health practitioners, policy makers, and researchers working with the population.

This study examines the effect of wear time on filtration efficiency. Disposable respirators were worn by CSIRO staff over a period of 4 weeks in early 2020. Participants wore the respirator masks for given times up to eight hours whilst working in laboratory/office environments. At that time COVID-19 precautions required staff to wear surgical (or other) masks and increase use of hand sanitizer from dispenser stations. Results obtained from a test group of ten individuals without health preconditions show an increasing number of masks failing with wear time, while the remainder continue to perform nearly unaffected for up to 8 h. Some masks were found to retain filtration performance better than others, possibly due to the type of challenge they were subjected to by the wearer. However, the rate and extent of decay are expected to differ between environments since there are many contributing factors and properties of the aerosol challenge cannot be controlled in a live trial. Penetration and variability increased during wear; the longer the wear time, the more deleterious to particle removal, particularly after approximately 2 h of wear. This behavior is captured in a descriptive statistical model based on results from a trial with this test group. The effectiveness of the masks in preventing the penetration of KCl particles was determined before and after wearing, with the analysis focusing on the most penetrating particles in a size range of 0.3C0.5 m diameter where respirator masks are most vulnerable. The basic elements of the study, including the approach to filter testing and sample sanitization, are broadly applicable.

This study aimed to assess the challenges faced by women who used RMNCH services in Nigeria's epicentre, their satisfaction with care received during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors associated with their satisfaction. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lagos, southwest Nigeria among 1,241 women of reproductive age who had just received RMNCH services at one of twenty-two health facilities across the primary, secondary and tertiary tiers of health care. The respondents were selected via multi-stage sampling and face to face exit interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. Client satisfaction was assessed across four sub-scales: health care delivery, health facility, interpersonal aspects of care and access to services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between personal characteristics and client satisfaction. RESULTS: About 43.51% of respondents had at least one challenge in accessing RMNCH services since the COVID-19 outbreak. Close to a third (31.91%) could not access service because they could not leave their houses during the lockdown and 18.13% could not access service because there was no transportation. The mean clients' satisfaction score among the respondents was 43.25 (SD: 6.28) out of a possible score of 57. Satisfaction scores for the interpersonal aspects of care were statistically significantly lower in the PHCs and general hospitals compared to teaching hospitals.

Neutralization of cationic proteins (such as neutrophil extracellular trap/NET-derived histones) with polyanionic compounds has been suggested as a potential strategy for protecting the endothelium from such insults. Here, we report that the FDA-approved polyanionic agent defibrotide (a pleotropic mixture of oligonucleotides) directly engages histones and thereby blocks their pathological effects on endothelium. In vitro, defibrotide counteracted endothelial cell activation and cell death, whether triggered by purified NETs, COVID-19 serum containing high levels of NETs, or recombinant histone H4. In vivo, defibrotide stabilized the endothelium and protected against histone-accelerated inferior vena cava thrombosis in mice. Mechanistically, defibrotide demonstrated direct and tight binding to histone H4 as detected by both electrophoretic mobility shift assay and surface plasmon resonance.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major swine pathogen causing immune suppression. MALT1 is a central immune regulator in both innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, MALT1 was confirmed to be induced rapidly upon PRRSV infection and mediate the degradation of two anti-PRRSV RNases, MCPIP1 and N4BP1, relying on its proteolytic activity, consequently facilitating PRRSV replication. Multiple PRRSV nsps, including nsp11, nsp7, and nsp4, contributed to MALT1 elicitation. Interestingly, the elevated expression of MALT1 began to decrease once intracellular viral expression reached a high enough level. Higher infection dose brought earlier MALT1 inflection. Further, PRRSV nsp6 mediated significant MALT1 degradation via ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Downregulation of MALT1 suppressed NF-B signals, leading to the decrease in proinflammatory cytokine expression. In conclusion, MALT1 expression was manipulated by PRRSV in an elaborate manner to antagonize precisely the antiviral effects of host RNases without excessive and continuous activation of inflammatory responses. These findings throw light on the machinery of PRRSV to build homeostasis in infected immune system for viral settlement. IMPORTANCE PRRSV is a major swine pathogen, suppresses innate immunity, and causes persistent infection and coinfection with other pathogens. As a central immune mediator, MALT1 plays essential roles in regulating immunity and inflammation. Here, PRRSV was confirmed to manipulate MALT1 expression in an accurate way to moderate the antiviral immunity. Briefly, multiple PRRSV nsps induced MALT1 protease to antagonize anti-PRRSV RNases N4BP1 and MCPIP1 upon infection, thereby facilitating viral replication. In contrast, PRRSV nsp6 downregulated MALT1 expression via ubiquitination-proteasome pathway to suppress the inflammatory responses upon infection aggravation, contributing to immune defense alleviation and virus survival. These findings revealed the precise expression control on MALT1 by PRRSV for antagonizing antiviral RNases, along with recovering immune homeostasis. For the first time, this study enlightens a new mechanism of PRRSV adapting antiviral innate immunity by modulating MALT1 expression.","output":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Adapts Antiviral Innate Immunity via Manipulating MALT1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A severe upper respiratory tract syndrome caused by the new coronavirus has now spread to the entire world as a highly contagious pandemic.

However, even if the COVID-19 had become, so to say, ready, conditions in the local environment would have had to prevail to induce the loss of the biodiversitys dilution effect that kept the virus under control, favoring its spillover from its bat reservoir to the human target. In the absence of these appropriate conditions only abortive attempts to initiate the pandemic could possibly occur: a number of them did indeed occur in China, and probably elsewhere as well. These conditions were unfortunately present at the wet marked in Wuhan at the end of last year.","output":"COVID19: an announced pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Smoking is extremely common amongst adults experiencing homelessness. To date, there is no nationally representative data on how tobacco dependence is treated and if and how smoking cessation is supported across the homeless sector. The aim of this study was to document smoking and e-cigarette policies of UK homeless services and identify areas of good practice and where improvements could be made. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with homeless centre staff was conducted between June 2020-December 2020 totalling 99 homeless centres. Quotas were stratified based on population and service type across Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and England. Interviews were conducted over the phone or online in a minority of cases. Survey questions were themed to assess, i) onsite smoking and e-cigarette (vaping) policies ii) screening and recording of smoking status, iii) cessation training and resources available to staff, iv) cessation support for service users. RESULTS: 92% accounted for smoking within their policies in some form (stand-alone policy (56%) or embedded within another health and safety policy (36%)). 84% allowed smoking in at least some (indoor and outdoor) areas. In areas where smoking was not allowed, vaping was also disallowed in 96% of cases. Staff smoking rates were 23% and 62% of centres reported staff smoked with service users. Just over half (52%) reported screening and recording smoking status and 58% made referrals to Stop Smoking Services (SSS), although established links with SSS were low (12%) and most centres did not provide staff training on supporting smoking cessation. Areas of good practice included regular offers of smoking cessation support embedded in routine health reviews or visits from SSS and offering tangible harm reduction support. Areas for improvement include staff training, staff smoking with service users and skipping routine screening questions around smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is accounted for across different policy types and restricted in some areas within most settings. Smoking cessation support is not routinely offered across the sector and there is little involvement with the SSS.

Dynamically adapting the allocation strategy to the evolving epidemiological situation could thus be critical during this initial phase of vaccine rollout. We developed a data-driven mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to explore optimal vaccine prioritization strategies in China that aim at reducing COVID-19 burden measured through different metrics. We found that reactively adapting the vaccination program to the epidemiological situation (i.e., allocate vaccine to a target group before reaching full coverage of other groups with initial higher priority) can be highly beneficial as such strategies are capable to simultaneously achieve different objectives (e.g., minimizing the number of deaths and of infections). The highest priority categories are broadly consistent under different hypotheses about vaccine efficacy, differential vaccine efficacy in preventing infection vs. disease, vaccine hesitancy, and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. Our findings also suggest that boosting the daily capacities up to 2.5 million courses (0.17% rollout speed) or higher could greatly reduce COVID-19 burden should a new wave start to unfold in China with reproduction number equal to 1.5 or lower.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire to elicit information on socio-economic and demographic characteristics, the types of stores visited to buy food, and FI screening. The FI experience was evaluated according to the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Factors associated with moderate or severe FI were investigated using the logistic regression model. SETTING: S?o Paulo city, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Totally, 909 householders. RESULTS: Eighty-eight per cent of the households included young women working as cleaners or kitchen assistants and in sales services. One-fifth of the participants were involved in the federal cash transfer programme, called Bolsa Famlia. There were 92 % households with children. The most frequent experience reported was uncertainty about food acquisition or receiving more (89 %), eating less than one should (64 %), not being able to eat healthy and nutritious food (46 %), and skipping a meal (39 %). Forty-seven per cent of the participants experienced moderate or severe FI. Factors associated with moderate and severe FI were low income, being a Bolsa Famlia recipient, having a low level of education and living in a household without children.

METHODS: This single-centre retrospective cohort study analysed presentations, incidence of mechanical complications, and mortality in patients with STEMI before and after a state of emergency was declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Japanese government on 7 April 2020. RESULTS: We analysed 359 patients with STEMI hospitalised before the declaration and 63 patients hospitalised after the declaration. The proportion of patients with late presentation was significantly higher after the declaration than before (25.4% vs 14.2%, p=0.03). The incidence of late presentation was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than before (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 2.41; 95% CI, 1.37 to 4.05; p=0.001, even after adjusting for month (IRR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.33 to 5.13; p<0.01). Primary PCI was performed significantly less often after the declaration than before (68.3% vs 82.5%, p=0.009).

We assessed North American paediatric centres adaptation to MIS-C and analysed the degree of agreement between algorithms on tiered clinical investigations. Methods This study evaluated MIS-C diagnostic algorithms from 50 tertiary centres developed between May 2020 and December 2021 in the United States and Canada obtained online and through colleagues in various institutions. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse results. Results All clinical pathways used a tiered approach, and most required coronavirus disease 2019 polymerase chain reaction testing on presentation. Over one-quarter used a 24-hour fever to initiate investigations, and another quarter used 3 days. Basic biochemical workup was performed in all centres on presentation (complete blood count, inflammatory markers, hepatic, and renal functions). Specialized investigation was generally reserved for secondary testing (cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiogram and echo, and coagulation panel). Institutions were divided on several investigations for tier distribution, including urine studies, blood cultures, chest radiograph, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serology. Subspecialty consultations were reserved for second-line testing, including cardiology, infectious disease, and rheumatology. Finally, we propose a composite algorithm representative of the consulted pathways. Conclusions Faced with an unprecedented clinical challenge, paediatric institutions responded swiftly with evaluation standardization, adapting to evolving knowledge. Most pathways agreed on initial basic screening tests followed by secondary workup including cardiac investigations.

This is due in part to our failure to better understand the mechanisms that drive spontaneous preterm labor (sPTL). Cyclic nucleotides are not the primary contributors to myometrial quiescence, but instead nitric oxide (NO)-mediated protein S-nitrosation (SNO) is integral to the relaxation of the tissue. Connexin-43 (Cx43), a myometrial contractile-associated protein that functions as either a gap junction channel or an hemichannel (HC), was the focus of this study. Protein analysis determined that Cx43 is downregulated in sPTL myometrium. Furthermore, Cx43 is S-nitrosated by NO, which correlates with an increase of phosphorylated Cx43 at serine 368 (Cx43-pS368 -gap junction inhibition) as well as an increase in the HC open-state probability (quiescence). Pharmacologic inhibition of Cx43 with 18-glycyrrhetinic acid (18-GA) exhibits a negative inotropic effect on the myometrium in a dose-dependent manner, as does administration of nebivolol, an NO synthase activator that increases total protein SNOs. When 18-GA and nebivolol were coadministered at their IC(50) values, the effect on contractile dynamics was additive and all but eliminated contractions. The development of new tocolytics demands a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of sPTL. Here it has been shown that 18-GA and nebivolol leverage dysregulated pathways in the myometrium, resulting in a novel approach for the treatment of sPTL. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Although there are many known causes of preterm labor (PTL), the mechanisms of spontaneous PTL (sPTL) remain obfuscated, which is why treating this condition is so challenging. Here we have identified that connexin-43 (Cx43), an important contractile-associated protein, is dysregulated in sPTL myometrium and that the pharmacologic inhibition of Cx43 and its S-nitrosation with 18-glycyrrhetinic acid and nebivolol, respectively, significantly blunts contraction in human myometrial tissue, presenting a novel approach to tocolysis that leverages maladjusted pathways in women who experience sPTL.","output":"Novel Tocolytic Strategy: Modulating Cx43 Activity by S-Nitrosation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW With the establishment of antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in low- and middle-income countries, people with HIV (PWH) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are living longer, subsequently developing chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

Generally the standardized difference between the growth rates of waves 1 and 2 and waves 2 and 3 were strongly positively correlated over short distances and shifted to a weak negative correlation at intermediate distances. We also found that peer county health group (a categorization of counties by demographic information relevant to public health) explained variation in response better between wave 1 and 2, while state identity was most important between wave 2 and 3.

Furthermore, there is a lack of systematized meta-information that allows clinical AI researchers to quickly determine accessibility, scope, content and other characteristics of datasets and benchmark datasets relevant to the clinical domain. To address these issues, we curated and released a comprehensive catalogue of datasets and benchmarks pertaining to the broad domain of clinical and biomedical natural language processing (NLP), based on a systematic review of literature and online resources.

We then compared tasks covered by AI benchmark datasets with relevant tasks that medical practitioners reported as highly desirable targets for automation in a previous empirical study. Our analysis indicates that AI benchmarks of direct clinical relevance are scarce and fail to cover most work activities that clinicians want to see addressed.

We evaluate the representativeness of FBDM data using the Mann-Kendall test and emerging hot and cold spots in an anomaly analysis to reveal the trend, magnitude, and agglommeration of population displacement during the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires in California, USA. Our results show that the distribution of FBDM pre-crisis users fits well with the total population from different sources. Due to usage habits, the elder population is underrepresented in FBDM data. During the two mega-fires in California, FBDM data effectively captured the temporal change of population arising from the placing and lifting of evacuation orders. Coupled with monotonic trends, the fall and rise of cold and hot spots of population revealed the areas with the greatest population drop and potential places to house the displaced residents. A comparison between the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires indicates that a densely populated region can be evacuated faster than a scarcely populated one, possibly due to the better access to transportation. In sparsely populated fire-prone areas, resources should be prioritized to move people to shelters as the displaced residents do not have many alternative options, while their counterparts in densely populated areas can utilize their social connections to seek temporary stay at nearby locations during an evacuation. Integrated with an assessment on underrepresented communities, FBDM data and the derivatives can provide much needed information of near real-time population displacement for crisis response and disaster relief. As applications and data generation mature, FBDM will harness crowdsourced data and aid first responder decision-making.","output":"Patterns of population displacement during mega-fires in California detected using Facebook Disaster Maps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tropical deforestation drivers are complex and can change rapidly in periods of profound societal transformation, such as those during a pandemic. Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred illegal, opportunistic forest clearing in tropical countries, threatening forest ecosystems and their resident human communities. A total of 9,583 km(2) of deforestation alerts from Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) were detected across the global tropics during the first month following the implementation of confinement measures of local governments to reduce COVID-19 spread, which is nearly double that of 2019 (4,732 km(2)). We present a conceptual framework linking tropical deforestation and the current pandemic. Zoonotic diseases, public health, economy, agriculture, and forests may all be reciprocally linked in complex positive and negative feedback loops with overarching consequences.

Timing of onset of COVID-19 signs and symptoms amongst cases in Uganda is however not known. Methods: we utilized data on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed cases to investigate symptom onset timing, from 21st March to 4th September 2020. Since timing of COVID-19 symptom onset is highly likely to be an interval rather than a point estimate, we generated 3-tertile categories: 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertile denoting symptom presentation within 3, 4 to 6 and at least 7 days. We considered all signs and symptoms in the database and analysed using Chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression, controlling for age and sex. Results: we analysed a total of 420 symptomatic case-patients; 72.0% were males, median age of 33 years. Common symptoms were cough (47.6%), running nose (46.2%), fever (27.4%), headache (26.4%) and sore throat (20.5%). We utilized 293 cases with clinical symptom onset date recorded. Most of the patients, 37.5%, presented symptom within 3 days, 31.4% had symptoms in the 2nd and 31.4% in 3rd tertile, denoting 4 to 6 days and at least 7 days after exposure. Running nose (RRR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.24-0.84) and chest pain (RRR=0.64, 95%CI: 0.09-0.72) were more likely to occur in 3rd tertile than 1st or 2nd tertile. Cases aged &#8805;20 years were less likely to have symptoms in the 1st and 2nd tertile compared to &#8804;20 years (p<0.05).

These pathways dampen the immune response by providing brakes on activated T cells, thereby ensuring more uniform and controlled immune reactions and avoiding immune hyper-responsiveness and autoimmunity. Cancer cells often exploit these regulatory controls through a variety of immune subversion mechanisms, which facilitate immune escape and tumor survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively block negative regulatory signals, thereby augmenting immune attack and tumor killing. This process is a double-edged sword in which release of regulatory controls is felt to be responsible for both the therapeutic efficacy of ICI therapy and the driver of immune-related adverse events (IrAEs). These adverse immune reactions are common, typically low-grade and may affect virtually every organ system. In the early clinical trials, lung IrAEs were rarely described. However, with ever-expanding clinical applications and more complex ICI-containing regimens, lung events, in particular, pneumonitis, have become increasingly recognized. ICI-related lung injury is clinically distinct from other types of lung toxicity and may lead to death in advanced stage disease. Thus, knowledge regarding the key characteristics and optimal treatment of lung-IrAEs is critical to good outcomes. This review provides an overview of lung-IrAEs, including risk factors and epidemiology, as well as clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of ICI-related lung injury. Management principles for ICI-related lung injury, including current consensus on steroid refractory pneumonitis and the use of other immune modulating agents in this setting are also highlighted.","output":"Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) 2020 clinical practice recommendations for the management of immune-related adverse events: pulmonary toxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia is an infection of the lung parenchyma caused by a wide variety of organisms in pediatric patients.

Following tissue injury, vascular endothelium becomes activated, losing its antithrombotic properties whereas inflammatory mediators build up a prothrombotic environment. Platelets are the first elements to be activated following endothelial damage; they participate in physiological haemostasis, but also in inflammatory and thrombotic events occurring in an injured tissue. While physiological haemostasis develops rapidly to prevent excessive blood loss in the endothelium activated by inflammation, hypoxia or by altered blood flow, thrombosis develops slowly. Activated platelets release the content of their granules, including ATP and ADP released from their dense granules. Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase1)/CD39 dephosphorylates ATP to ADP and to AMP, which in turn, is hydrolysed to adenosine by ecto-5-nucleotidase (CD73). NTPDase1/CD39 has emerged has an important molecule in the vasculature and on platelet surfaces; it limits thrombotic events and contributes to maintain the antithrombotic properties of endothelium. The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of platelets as cellular elements interfacing haemostasis and inflammation, with a particular focus on the emerging role of NTPDase1/CD39 in controlling both processes.","output":"Thrombo-Inflammation: A Focus on NTPDase1/CD39"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 interacted with long-unfolding economic trends to set a global tinder box aflame Over the past thirty years, the world's workforce has increasingly found employment in low-wage, low-productivity jobs in the global services sector The pandemic lockdowns hit these sorts of activities the hardest Opportunities to work evaporated, spreading both poverty and hunger around the world The same rise in global service sector employment shares, which amplified the pandemic lockdown's destructive effects, will now slow the pace of the recovery The transition to a services-based economy has accelerated, due to what Jos Antonio Ocampo and Tomasso Faccio call too much excess capacity and too little certainty about future demand, which have depressed levels of investment and ushered in a period of economic stagnation COVID-19 will make these tendencies worse Weak economic recoveries will further entrench an economic order in which employers pay little attention to workers demands, deepening employment insecurity and economic inequality The future for labor looks bleak What that means for the future of working people remains an open question Their fight for dignity, in the midst of the pandemic and post-pandemic eras, will prove decisive","output":"Service Work in the Pandemic Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, the author investigates and analyzes the effect of Brexit in the UK after Covid-19, the expansion of Chinas influence in the CentralCEastCSouthern half of the European Union, and the emerging narrative of Illiberal Democracy from Hungarys leader Victor Orbn that is shaking western values in Central East Europe(*).

More significantly, as the Internet of Things (IoT) has proliferated, billions of portable and embedded devices have been interconnected, producing zillions of gigabytes on edge networks. Thus, there is an immediate need to push AI (artificial intelligence) breakthroughs within edge networks to achieve the full promise of edge data analytics. EI solutions have supported digital technology workloads and applications from the infrastructure level to edge networks; however, there are still many challenges with the heterogeneity of computational capabilities and the spread of information sources. We propose a novel event-driven deep-learning framework, called EDL-EI (event-driven deep learning for edge intelligence), via the design of a novel event model by defining events using correlation analysis with multiple sensors in real-world settings and incorporating multi-sensor fusion techniques, a transformation method for sensor streams into images, and lightweight 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models. To demonstrate the feasibility of the EDL-EI framework, we presented an IoT-based prototype system that we developed with multiple sensors and edge devices. To verify the proposed framework, we have a case study of air-quality scenarios based on the benchmark data provided by the USA Environmental Protection Agency for the most polluted cities in South Korea and China. We have obtained outstanding predictive accuracy (97.65% and 97.19%) from two deep-learning models on the cities air-quality patterns.

The clinical, laboratory and radiographic data, treatment, and short-term outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age was 57.912 years, and 50% were women. Four patients had previous vascular comorbidities. All the patients suffered from severe pneumonia, requiring intensive care unit admission. Five patients were not hypertensive at presentation (all SBP<127 mmHg). Neurologic symptoms included seizures in 7 patients; impaired consciousness in 5 patients; focal neurological signs in 3 patients; and visual disturbances in 1 patient. All patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging which indicated asymmetric T2 prolongation or diffusion changes (50%), extensive fronto-parieto-occipital involvement (25%), vascular irregularities (12.5%) and intracranial hemorrhage (25%).

In multiple analysis, male gender (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.20), advanced age ([reference: 15 - 29 years old] 30 - 44, RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 - 1.11; 45 - 59, RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.15 - 1.38; 60 years or older, RR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 - 1.60), chronic kidney disease (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.04 - 1.64) and thoracic pain (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.10 - 1.24) were associated with an increased risk of severe disease. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating predictors of COVID-19 severity in a large subset of the Latin-American population. It is also the first in documenting gender-related differences regarding the severity of the illness. These results may be useful for health care protocols for the early detection and management of COVID-19 patients that may benefit from opportune and specialized supportive medical treatment.","output":"Male gender and kidney illness associated with an increased risk of severe laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the outcomes of delayed primary repair of flexor tendons in Zone 2 in 31 fingers and thumb (28 patients) averaging 15 days (range 4-37) after injury in 2020.

OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to investigate markers of hypercoaguablility (factor VIII activity, D-Dimer) in hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, evaluation of certain markers of inflammation (S. ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], C-reactive protein [CRP], and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and correlate those markers with each other. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 70 adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Blood samples were obtained for FVIII, D. dimer, and ESR. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 and Microsoft Office Excel 2010. RESULTS: The mean age of enrolled 70 patients was 60.22 +/- 14.43 years. 44 (62.9%) of patients had neutrophilia and lymphopenia was seen in 41 (58.6%). High ratio of N/L was seen in 66 (94.3%). Low count of eosinophil was seen in 44 (62.9%), high LDH level was seen at 57 (81.4%). Regarding serum ferritin, high level was seen 64 (91.4%) and high level of CRP was seen in 56 (80%).

METHODS: The charts of 90 patients from a single institution were reviewed. Of these patients, 45 visited the virtual clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. The other 45 patients visited the clinic in the 3 months prior to COVID-19. Demographics including the mean age at the visit, chief complaint, visit diagnosis, appointment duration, helmet usage, accuracy of the diagnosis, need for a CT scan, and the need for a follow-up appointment were assessed. Diagnostic accuracy, the frequency of follow-up appointments, and patient satisfaction (via survey), as well as additional associated factors, were analyzed to determine the efficacy and satisfaction associated with the virtual clinic approach. RESULTS: The mean patient age at time of the visit was 5.6 and 7.3 months (p = 0.244), and the mean time from referral to appointment was 19.2 and 19 days (p = 0.934), in the in-person and virtual cohorts, respectively. There was no significant difference in the variety of chief complaints between the in-person and virtual visits, with 97.8% and 93.3% of patients' parents reporting abnormal head shape, respectively, and the remainder reporting more infrequent complaints (p = 0.435). The visit diagnosis was plagiocephaly in 93.3% of the in-person cohort and 80.0% of the virtual cohort (p = 0.118). The final diagnosis exhibited a similar pattern, with 95.6% of the in-person cohort and 88.9% of the virtual cohort observed as positional plagiocephaly; the remaining diagnoses were more infrequent (p = 0.434). The most common alternative diagnosis in the virtual visit cohort was a metopic ridge (8.4%). In the in-person visit cohort, the most common alternative diagnosis was equally a benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space in infancy, scalp mass, and skull lesion (2.2% each). None of the patients in either cohort were diagnosed with synostosis. Eighty percent of the in-person visits were 15 to 30 minutes in duration, with the remaining 20% being 31 minutes or longer; virtual visits were all 30 minutes or less, with 95.6% being 15 to 30 minutes (p = 0.002). Helmets were prescribed for 2 patients in the in-person cohort and no patients in the virtual cohort (p = 0.494). Alterations in diagnosis were made in 2.2% of in-person visits and 6.7% of virtual visits (p = 0.616). Follow-up was required in 15.6% of the in-person visits and 31.1% of the virtual visits (p = 0.134). CT was only utilized twice, once in the in-person visit cohort and once in the virtual visit cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual clinic encounters resulted in comparable diagnostic accuracy. The trend toward frequent follow-up assessments and changes in the final diagnosis in the virtual clinic cohort has indicated a level of diagnostic uncertainty via the virtual interface, which required in-person assessment for confirmation. This finding did not contribute toward diagnostic inaccuracy with respect to missed synostosis.

A mathematical modelling analysis was performed to compare the potential short-term impact of allocating the available doses to either the high-risk group (over 65-year-olds) or the high incidence group (aged 20-39). Vaccinating the high incidence group with a vaccine with sufficiently high protection against infection (more than 50%) could provide enough herd effects to delay the expected epidemic peak, resulting in fewer deaths within the 12-month time horizon compared to vaccinating the same number of the high-risk group. After 12 months, if no further vaccination or other interventions were deployed, this strategy would lead to more deaths. With the right vaccine efficacy profile, targeting the high incidence groups could be a viable short-term component of the Thai vaccination strategy.

Literature on COVID-19 highlighted the central role of the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System in the determinism of SARS-CoV2 cellular internalization in the target tissues. Lung degeneration and respiratory distress appear to be dependent on the perturbance of physiological mechanisms, such as the uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a dysregulation of the fibrinolytic coagulative cascade and the hyperactivation of immune effector cells. In this mini review, we address the physiology of Midkine, a growth factor able to bind heparin, and its pathophysiological potential role in COVID-19 determinism. Midkine increases in many inflammatory and autoimmune conditions and correlates with several dysfunctional immune-inflammatory responses that appear to show similarities with the pathophysiological elicited by SARS-CoV2. Midkine, together with its receptor, could facilitate the virus entry, fostering its accumulation and increasing its affinity with Ace2 receptor. We also focus on Netosis, a particular mechanism of pathogen clearance exerted by neutrophils, which under certain pathological condition becomes dysfunctional and can cause tissue damage. Moreover, we highlight the mechanism of autophagy that the new coronavirus could try to escape in order to replicate itself, as well as on pulmonary fibrosis induced by hypoxia and on the release of cytokines and mediators of inflammation, correlating the interplay between Midkine and SARS-CoV2.","output":"Physiology of Midkine and Its Potential Pathophysiological Role in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections are expected, reporting on breakthrough infections requiring hospitalization remains limited.

Patient variables, COVID-19 lab testing including anti-S IgM, anti-N IgG antibodies, and hospital course were recorded. Based on lab testing, infections were defined as acute infection or resolving/resolved infection. RESULTS: Of the ten patients admitted with breakthrough infections, all were > 70 years of age with multiple comorbidities. Mean time between second vaccine dose and COVID-19 diagnosis was 49 days. In the seven individuals with acute infection, none had observed serologic response to mRNA vaccination, five developed severe disease, and one died. Three individuals had anti-N IgG antibodies and a high polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold (C(t)) value, suggesting resolving/resolved infection. CONCLUSIONS: Given the variability of vaccine breakthrough infections requiring hospitalization, serologic testing may impart clarity on timing of infection and disease prognosis.

The framework combines many available data sources (number of positive cases, number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care, etc.) to make outputs as accurate as possible and incorporates the times of non-pharmaceutical governmental interventions which were adopted worldwide to slow-down the pandemic. The model estimates the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, the number of infected individuals and the number of patients in different disease progression states in time. It can be used for estimating current infection fatality rate, proportion of individuals not detected and short term forecasting of important indicators for monitoring the state of the healthcare system. With the prediction of the number of patients in hospitals and intensive care units, policy makers could make data driven decisions to potentially avoid overloading the capacities of the healthcare system. The model is applied to Slovene COVID-19 data showing the effectiveness of the adopted interventions for controlling the epidemic by reducing the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. It is estimated that the proportion of infected people in Slovenia was among the lowest in Europe (0.350%, 90% CI [0.245-0.573]%), that infection fatality rate in Slovenia until the end of first wave was 1.56% (90% CI [0.94-2.21]%) and the proportion of unidentified cases was 88% (90% CI [83-93]%).

RECENT FINDINGS: Having an intimate partner is associated with reduced risk of incident CHD and a better prognosis among patients, but strain (e.g., conflict) and disruption (i.e., separation, divorce) in these relationships are associated with increased risk and poor outcomes. These associations likely reflect mechanisms involving health behavior and the physiological effects of emotion and stress. Importantly, many other well-established psychosocial risk and protective factors (e.g., low SES, job stress, depression, and optimism) are strongly related to the quality of intimate relationships, and these associations likely contribute to the effects of those other psychosocial factors. For better or worse, intimate partners can also affect the outcome of efforts to alter health behaviors (physical activity, diet, smoking, and medication adherence) central in the prevention and management CHD. Intimate partners also influenceand are influenced bystressful aspects of acute coronary crises and longer-term patient adjustment and management. SUMMARY: Evidence on each of these roles of intimate relationships in CHD is considerable, but direct demonstrations of the value of couple assessments and interventions are limited, although preliminary research is promising. Research needed to close this gap must also address issues of diversity, disparities, and inequity that have strong parallels in CHD and intimate relationships.","output":"Intimate Relationships and Coronary Heart Disease: Implications for Risk, Prevention, and Patient Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health and social measures (PHSMs) targeting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have potentially affected the epidemiological dynamics of endemic infectious diseases. In this study, we investigated the impact of PHSMs for COVID-19, with a particular focus on varicella dynamics in Japan. We adopted the susceptible-infectious-recovered type of mathematical model to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of varicella from Jan. 2010 to Sep. 2021. We analyzed epidemiological and demographic data and estimated the within-year and multi-year component of the force of infection and the biases associated with reporting and ascertainment in three periods: pre-vaccination (Jan. 2010-Dec. 2014), pre-pandemic vaccination (Jan. 2015-Mar. 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Apr. 2020-Sep. 2021). By using the estimated parameter values, we reconstructed and predicted the varicella dynamics from 2010 to 2027. Although the varicella incidence dropped drastically during the COVID-19 pandemic, the change in susceptible dynamics was minimal; the number of susceptible individuals was almost stable. Our prediction showed that the risk of a major outbreak in the post-pandemic era may be relatively small. However, uncertainties, including age-related susceptibility and travel-related cases, exist and careful monitoring would be required to prepare for future varicella outbreaks.","output":"Transmission dynamics of varicella before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: a modelling study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a pair of models that speak to the goals and design of the sort of business lending and corporate bond purchase programs that have been introduced by governments in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

These led to the approach using immunosuppressive agents. It is intriguing whether certain biomarkers can aid the proper administration of such drugs. METHODS: Plasma specimens of 58 COVID-19 patients with differing severity, from very mild illness (group A), mild (group B), moderate (group C), and severe/critical illness (group D) were assayed for cyto-chemokines and terminal complement complex (SC5b-9) during the course of diseases. None received anti-IL-6 therapy, there was no mortality in this cohort. RESULTS: IP-10 and RANTES levels were dominant cytokines. IP-10 levels increased significantly in all groups when compared between pre-nadir and nadir phases (group A, p =0.428; group B =0.034; group C =0.159; group D <0.001) and in groups B and D when compared between nadir and recovery phases (p <0.001). RANTES levels were elevated in all groups across all phases with no significant differences. SC5b-9 levels increased significantly as compared to healthy controls [pre-nadir- group A versus healthy, p =0.122; group B-D versus healthy, p =0.021); nadir-group A versus healthy, p =0.003; group B-D versus healthy, p <0.001; recovery phase (p <0.001)] but not between groups A and B-D at pre-nadir (p=0.606). CONCLUSION: The absence of significant pro-inflammatory responses and early elevation of IP-10 levels and complement activation may be favorable and necessary for viral elimination in COVID-19 patients.

Several clinical studies are underway that test the effects of inhibiting IL-6, IL-1? or TNF or targeting cytokine signalling via Janus kinase inhibition in the treatment of COVID-19. Despite these similarities, COVID-19 and other zoonotic coronavirus-mediated diseases do not induce clinical arthritis, suggesting that a local inflammatory niche develops in alveolar structures and drives the disease process.

They lead to a pseudo-normalisation of the water diffusivity and transverse relaxation time maps in the subacute and chronic phases of stroke. Within the context of diffusion MRI, the free water elimination and mapping method (FWE) with echo time dependence has been proposed as a promising approach to measure the amount of free fluid in brain tissue robustly and to eliminate its biasing effect on other biomarkers. In this longitudinal study of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in the rat brain, we investigated the use of FWE MRI with echo time dependence for the characterisation of the tissue microstructure and explored the potential of the free water fraction as a novel biomarker of ischaemic tissue condition. METHODS Adult rats received a transient MCAo. Diffusion- and transverse relaxation-weighted MRI experiments were performed longitudinally, pre-occlusion and on days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 after MCAo on four rats. Histology was performed for non-stroke and 1, 3 and 10 days after MCAo on three different rats at each time point. RESULTS The free water fraction was homogeneously increased in the ischaemic cortex one day after stroke. Between three and ten days after stroke, the core of the ischaemic tissue showed a progressive normalisation in the amount of free water, whereas the inner and outer border zones of the ischaemic cortex depicted a large, monotonous increase with time. The specific lesions in brain sections were verified by H&E and immunostaining. The tissue-specific diffusion and relaxometry MRI metrics in the ischaemic cortex were significantly different compared to their conventional counterpart. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that the free water fraction in FWE MRI with echo time dependence is a valuable biomarker, sensitive to the progressive degeneration in ischaemic tissue. We showed that part of the heterogeneity previously observed in conventional parameter maps can be accounted for by a heterogeneous distribution of free water in the tissue. Our results suggest that the temporal evolution of the free fluid fraction map at the core and inner border zone can be associated with the pathological changes linked to the evolution of vasogenic oedema. Namely, the homogeneous increase in free water one day after stroke and its tendency to normalise in the core of the ischaemic cortex starting three days after stroke, followed by a progressive increase in free water at the inner border zone from three to ten days after stroke. Finally, the monotonous increase in free fluid in the outer border zones of the cortex reflects the formation of fluid-filled cysts.","output":"Spatiotemporal characterisation of ischaemic lesions in transient stroke animal models using diffusion free water elimination and mapping MRI with echo time dependence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies suggest that individual difference in intra-individual variability (IIV) of reaction times is an important indicator of attentional executive control. However, there are few existing studies on the executive control of high trait-anxious individuals assessed by using reaction time variability.

In the emotional task, GAD patients had significantly slower response speed, lower accuracy, and greater IIV parameters than the LTA and HTA groups. In the non-emotional task, the GAD group exhibited poorer processing efficiency, greater SD and RTCV, and intact performance effectiveness.

Here we describe the validation of an improved sample preparation method for extraction free Direct RT-LAMP and define the clinical performance of four different RT-LAMP assay formats for detection of SARS-CoV-2 within a large-scale multisite clinical evaluation. We describe Direct RT-LAMP on 559 swabs and 86,760 saliva samples and RNA RT-LAMP on extracted RNA from 12,619 swabs and 12,521 saliva samples collected from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals across multiple healthcare and community settings. For Direct RT-LAMP, we found a diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 70.35% (95% CI 63.48-76.60%) on swabs and 84.62% (79.50-88.88%) on saliva, with diagnostic specificity (DSp) of 100% (98.98-100.00%) on swabs and 100% (99.72-100.00%) on saliva when compared to RT-qPCR. Analysing samples with RT-qPCR ORF1ab CT values of []25 and []33 (high and medium-high viral copy number, respectively), we found DSe of 100% (96.34-100%) and 77.78% (70.99-83.62%) for swabs, and 99.01% (94.61-99.97%) and 87.32% (80.71-92.31%) for saliva. For RNA RT-LAMP DSe and DSp were 95.98% (92.74-98.06%) and 99.99% (99.95-100%) for swabs, and 80.65% (73.54-86.54%) and 99.99% (99.95-100%) for saliva, respectively.

Author SummaryRapid diagnostic testing at scale to identify and isolate symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals potentially transmitting infectious SARS-CoV-2 is an essential part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RT-LAMP on both extracted RNA and directly on crude samples potentially provides faster turnaround times than reverse-transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR testing, with a higher sensitivity and specificity than antigen lateral flow devices. Increasing evidence points to potential benefits of SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva rather than nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs, leading us to undertake a multi-site evaluation of an improved simple sample preparation method for Direct SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP. Our study demonstrated that the RNA RT-LAMP assay has high sensitivity and specificity, providing a rapid alternative to RT-qPCR testing with a reliance on differing reagents and equipment. The simple SARS-CoV-2 Direct RT-LAMP preparation method also demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and naso/oropharyngeal swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, notably in saliva samples from which the individual would likely be considered infectious. The findings highlight the usefulness of saliva as a simple to collect, non-invasive, sample type, potentially applicable for interval-based testing of asymptomatic individuals.","output":"RT-LAMP has high accuracy for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and naso/oropharyngeal swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human RIF1 functions in DNA replication and damage repair. Of clinical interest, RIF1-depleted cells are highly sensitive to replication inhibitors such as Aphidicolin, but the reasons for this sensitivity have been enigmatic.

We find that RIF1-Long alone can protect cells against replication inhibition, but RIF1-Short is completely incapable of mediating protection. Consistent with its isoform-specific role in enabling survival, RIF1-Long is specifically required to promote the formation of the 53BP1 nuclear bodies that protect unrepaired damage sites in the G1 phase following replication stress. Overall, our observations show that RIF1 is needed at several cell cycle stages to support genome maintenance following replication insult, with the RIF1-Long isoform playing a previously unsuspected but crucial role in damage site protection during the ensuing G1 phase.","output":"The RIF1-Long splice variant promotes G1 phase 53BP1 nuclear bodies to protect against replication stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Wealth mobility, as both relative (positional) and absolute (material) wealth acquisition, may counteract negative consequences of early life adversities on adult health. METHODS: We use longitudinal data (1967C2018) from the INCAP birth cohort, Guatemala (n = 1386). Using wealth as a measure of socio-economic position, we assess the association of life course relative mobility using latent class analysis and absolute material gains using conditional wealth measures. We estimate associations of wealth mobility with indicators of human capital, specifically height, weight status (BMI in kg/m(2)), psychological distress (WHO SRQ-20 score) and fluid intelligence (Ravens Progressive Matrices score; RPM) in middle adulthood. RESULTS: We identified four latent classes of relative mobility C Stable Low (n = 498), Stable High (n = 223), Downwardly Mobile (n = 201) and Upwardly Mobile (n = 464). Attained schooling (years) was positively associated with membership in Upwardly Mobile (odds ratio; 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71) vs Stable Low, and inversely with membership in Downwardly Mobile (0.65, 95%CI: 0.54, 0.79) vs Stable High. Being Upwardly Mobile (vs Stable Low) was positively associated with height (1.88 cm, 95%CI: 1.04, 2.72), relative weight (1.32 kg/m(2), 95%CI: 0.57, 2.07), lower psychological distress (?0.82 units, 95%CI: 1.34, ?0.29) and fluid intelligence (0.94 units, 95%CI: 0.28, 1.59). Being Downwardly Mobile (vs Stable High) was associated with lower fluid intelligence (?2.69 units, 95%CI: 3.69, ?1.68), and higher psychological distress (1.15 units, 95%CI: 0.34, 1.95).

Genomic alterations in a viral genome can lead to either better or worse outcome and identifying these mutations is of utmost importance. Here, we correlated protein-level mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to clinical outcome. Methods. Mutations in viral sequences from the GISAID virus repository were evaluated by using hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 as the reference. Patient outcomes were classified as mild disease, hospitalization and severe disease (death or documented treatment in an intensive-care unit). Chi-square test was applied to examine the association between each mutation and patient outcome. False discovery rate was computed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and results passing a FDR cutoff of 5% were accepted as significant. Results. Mutations were mapped to amino acid changes for 2,120 non-silent mutations. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in the 3'-to5' exonuclease, in ORF3a, NSP2 and N. Mutations leading to severe outcome with low prevalence were found in the surface (S) glycoprotein and in NSP7. Five out of 17 of the most significant mutations mapped onto a 10 amino acid long phosphorylated stretch of N indicating that in spite of obvious sampling restrictions the approach can find functionally relevant sites in the viral genome.

METHODS: This investigation was a survey of HCWs at a level 1 trauma teaching hospital regarding PPE compliance patterns prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: HCWs reported an increase in PPE compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half (48.6%) of respondents reported that isolation type impacted the decision to wear PPE, of which most were likely to forgo PPE with contact precautions. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs identified multiple barriers to compliance. The underutilization of PPE with contact precautions suggests that the risk of exposure is interpreted as low, and this could be a future target of education.","output":"Through Their Eyes: Health Care Worker Compliance With Personal Protective Equipment During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing was planned as a preventive measure to control the extensive spread of COVID-19. COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil were analyzed during the period of social distancing measures. Mortality data for COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Deaths were estimated up to the 31st day after the occurrence of the 5th COVID-19-related death in Brazil. Social distance was measured using Google's community mobility reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). The Brazilian epidemic curves were interconnected, and mathematical models were evaluated to fit the mortality estimation curves. The optimistic model was defined in the opening period of social distancing and, therefore, in the lower mobility (40-60%). The realistic model was calculated according to relaxed social distance measures (<40%) and the pessimistic model was calculated based on the transmission rate between 2-3. Thus, the equations of the mathematical models provided the outcomes for the date of June 9, 2020, as follows: realistic model with 40,623 deaths, pessimistic model with 64,310 deaths and the optimistic model with a projection of 31,384 deaths. As a result of these analyzes, on May 24, 2020, there were a total of 22,965 deaths related to COVID-19, and those deaths included within the proposed mathematical models were 17,452 for the optimistic model, 22,623 for the realistic model and 32,825 for the pessimistic model. Thus, it is concluded that social distancing measures promoted by the Brazilian public managers contributes to the reduction in approximately ten thousand deaths related to COVID-19 in the current pandemic scenario.","output":"Social distancing measures could have reduced estimated deaths related to COVID-19 in Brazil/ Medidas de distanciamento social podem ter reduzido as mortes estimadas relacionadas  COVID-19 no Brasil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background To maintain physical distancing for reducing the spread of COVID-19, online learning appears to be a viable option to carry on teaching and learning.

In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFlu(TM) database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak. We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus. The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau () using the formula t=/2u. A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation. No combinations were detected. The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups. By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3. The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019.

It describes the most frequent and/or severe complications reported in the elderly in both randomized controlled trials and observational studies with metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (gliptins) and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (gliflozins). EXPERT OPINION : Old patients may present comorbidities (renal impairment, vascular disease, heart failure, risk of dehydration, osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction) that could increase the risk of severe adverse events. Sulfonylureas (and meglitinides) induce hypoglycemia, which may be associated with falls/fractures and cardiovascular events. Medications lacking hypoglycemia should be preferred. Gliptins appear to have the best tolerance/safety profile whereas gliflozins exert a cardiorenal protection.

RECENT FINDINGS: In the United States, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children have been mild illnesses, with those 5-17 years of age having the highest frequency. Specifically, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in children is two times higher in adolescents (12-17 years) than younger school-aged children (5-11 years). Despite the higher case counts in older children, 10% of pediatric hospitalizations have been in infants less than one year. In addition, severe respiratory and renal complications, hospitalization, and even death have been documented in children. SUMMARY: Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress, with mild nonspecific symptoms being the most commonly reported. The broad clinical presentation and the frequency of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections in children pose challenges for controlling and detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, severe disease has been noted in children with associated medical complications and death.

Grant recipients represented a variety of sectors, including education, government, and nonprofit organizations. EVALUATION METHODS Primary (surveys) and secondary (final reports) data documented achievement of PSE changes. RESULTS A total of $196,369 was dispersed to 65 organizations; 126 PSE changes in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco were reported. Challenges in implementing and evaluating mini-grants were identified, including the heterogeneity of the sectors/settings involved and associated variability of proposed activities, time lines, measurement, and evaluation activities. COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) also disrupted the plans for many projects. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH The success of this initiative can be attributed to four main elements: (1) the use of intermediary organizations to facilitate the mini-grants; (2) a participatory evaluation process, combined with early and ongoing communication among all stakeholders; (3) a braided funding strategy; and (4) a multisector approach that engaged both traditional and nontraditional public health organizations.

Micro-CT provides the means to non-invasively acquire detailed anatomical information, but high-resolution imaging comes at the cost of longer scan times and higher doses, which is not desirable given the potential risks related to x-ray radiation. To achieve dose reduction and higher throughputs without compromising image quality, fewer projections can be acquired. This is where iterative reconstruction methods can have the potential to reduce noise since these algorithms can better handle sparse projection data, compared to filtered backprojection PURPOSE: We evaluate the performance characteristics of a compact benchtop micro-CT scanner that provides iterative reconstruction capabilities with GPU-based acceleration. We thereby investigate the potential benefit of iterative reconstruction for dose reduction. METHODS: Based on a series of phantom experiments, the benchtop micro-CT system was characterized in terms of image uniformity, noise, low contrast detectability, linearity, and spatial resolution. Whole-body images of a plasticized ex vivo mouse phantom were also acquired. Different acquisition protocols (general-purpose versus high-resolution, including low dose scans) and different reconstruction strategies (analytic versus iterative algorithms: FDK, ISRA, ISRA-TV) were compared. RESULTS: Signal uniformity was maintained across the radial and axial field-of-view (no cupping effect) with an average difference in Hounsfield units (HU) between peripheral and central regions below 50. For low contrast detectability, regions with at least ?HU of 40 to surrounding material could be discriminated (for rods of 2.5 mm diameter). A high linear correlation (R2 = 0.997) was found between measured CT values and iodine concentrations (0-40 mg/ml). Modulation transfer function (MTF) calculations on a wire phantom evaluated a resolution of 10.2 lp/mm at 10% MTF that was consistent with the 8.3% MTF measured on the 50 m bars (10 lp/mm) of a bar-pattern phantom. Noteworthy changes in signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise values were found for different acquisition and reconstruction protocols. Our results further showed the potential of iterative reconstruction to deliver images with less noise and artefacts. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the micro-CT system that was evaluated in the present work was shown to provide a good combination of performance characteristics between image uniformity, low contrast detectability, and resolution in short scan times. With the iterative reconstruction capabilities of this micro-CT system in mind (ISRA and ISRA-TV), the adoption of such algorithms by GPU-based acceleration enables the integration of noise reduction methods which here demonstrated potential for high-quality imaging at reduced doses.","output":"Performance evaluation of a micro-CT system for laboratory animal imaging with iterative reconstruction capabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Containment measures for COVID-19 have affected surgical training globally.

Despite treatment being in line with current guidelines, mortality remains high in those with septic shock. Intravenous immunoglobulins represent a promising therapy to modulate both the pro- and anti-inflammatory processes and can contribute to the elimination of pathogens. In this context, there is evidence of the benefits of immunoglobulin M (IgM)- and immunoglobulin A (IgA)-enriched immunoglobulin therapy for sepsis. This manuscript aims to summarize current relevant data to provide expert opinions on best practice for the use of an IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin) in adult patients with sepsis. MAIN TEXT: Sepsis patients with hyperinflammation and patients with immunosuppression may benefit most from treatment with IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin). Patients with hyperinflammation present with phenotypes that manifest throughout the body, whilst the clinical characteristics of immunosuppression are less clear. Potential biomarkers for hyperinflammation include elevated procalcitonin, interleukin-6, endotoxin activity and C-reactive protein, although thresholds for these are not well-defined. Convenient biomarkers for identifying patients in a stage of immune-paralysis are still matter of debate, though human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related expression on monocytes, lymphocyte count and viral reactivation have been proposed. The timing of treatment is potentially more critical for treatment efficacy in patients with hyperinflammation compared with patients who are in an immunosuppressed stage. Due to the lack of evidence, definitive dosage recommendations for either population cannot be made, though we suggest that patients with hyperinflammation should receive an initial bolus at a rate of up to 0.6 mL (30 mg)/kg/h for 6 h followed by a continuous maintenance rate of 0.2 mL (10 mg)/kg/hour for &#8805; 72 h (total dose &#8805; 0.9 g/kg). For immunosuppressed patients, dosage is more conservative (0.2 mL [10 mg]/kg/h) for &#8805; 72 h, without an initial bolus (total dose &#8805; 0.72 g/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Two distinct populations that may benefit most from Pentaglobin therapy are described in this review.

The questionnaire results show that Spanish Universities refused body donations and stopped all dissection research and teaching. The Covid-19 expected influence on Anatomy teaching was referred to the increase of teaching workforce and resources required to apply the new safety measures to future practical activities, as well as to prepare and adapt teaching material for online-only programs. The application of reinforced safety measures was expected to be perceived by the respondent's students as a gain in teaching quality, while the transformation of the anatomy courses in online-only programs will be perceived as a quality decrease. The respondent's concerns about future institutional implications of the pandemic were related to increased costs of the adaptation of the facilities and the reinforced preventive measures, as well as the eventual decrease in donations. The complete lockdown applied on dissection rooms is not justified by scientific evidence and represents a break of the confidence deposed in the institutions by the donors.

Methods: : This observational retrospective study was conducted in a French geriatric ward from March 17 to April 18, 2020. All 118 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 over 70 yo in acute stay care were enrolled. Patients with a treatment or a pathology which could interfere with eosinophil count were excluded. Results: : No statistical difference was found between surviving or deceased patient regarding age (mean age (SD): 87 years (7)) and sex (34% of males). Differences for the most frequent acute events were statically different: Quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score was  2 at admission for 23% in the survivor group vs. 23 (72%) in the deceased (p < .001);acute kidney injury concerned 17% of the survivors vs. 69% of the decease (p< .001). Eosinopenia < 10/mm3 was significantly associated with mortality (OR (CI95%)) = 3.5 (1.2-11.4) after adjustment on age, gender, and activity of daily living. Conclusion: Absolute eosinopenia was associated with in hospital mortality in older adults. This result, if confirmed in other study, may help to predict the outcome of a SARS-COV-2 infection on geriatric patients and calls for immunologist to explore more globally the impact of inflammaging on the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Association between absolute eosinopenia and mortality in SARS-COV-2 infection on the 70+, a discussed observation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Qualitative olfactory disorders in the form of parosmia and phantosmia are very subjective and cannot be measured at present. They pose an unpleasant experience for patients and a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterise the specific experiences of patients affected by the qualitative symptoms of parosmia and phantosmia including both triggers for symptoms and self-help measures they have tried. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey questionnaire was developed with the input of patient experts within the charity Fifth Sense. The survey was then open online for 3 months to charity members complaining of qualitative symptoms. The survey captured the frequency and impact of symptoms and self-management undertaken. Reflective feedback was also captured from a patient workshop. RESULTS: There were 100 participants; 61% female, age range 13-88. Common self-reported aetiology included sinonasal disease (17%), idiopathic (33%) and post-viral olfactory loss (26%) and post-traumatic olfactory loss (23%). Parosmia was reported as a daily symptom in 67% compared to 31% for phantosmia; 36% complained of suffering with both symptoms. Only 4% of respondents reported having received any successful treatment for their qualitative symptoms and 58% reported having received no treatment whatsoever. Olfactory training was the most common self-management method reported. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates that qualitative disturbances remain problematic for those who experience them due to the duration of symptoms, the relative lack of experience or knowledge amongst medical professionals and the lack of therapeutic options.

Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of pulse-steroid in case of unresponsiveness to treatment with high dose steroid. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is a retrospective controlled trial. We divided the patients in three groups: Standard-care therapy alone, high-dose steroid treatment and pulse-steroid treatment (250 mg/day methy-prednisolone). One hundred fifty patients were enrolled in each group. All patients were hospitalized and needed oxygen support. We matched the patients according to disease severity at the onset of hypoxia, weight of co-morbidities, age and gender. We then compared three groups in terms of mortality, length of hospitalization, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay in ICU and duration of MV. RESULTS: The pulse-steroid group had shorter ICU stay. The median ICU stay was 9.0(CI 95% 6.0-12.0) days in standard ?care group, 8.0(CI 95% 5.0-13.0) days in high-dose steroid group and 4.5(CI %95 3.0-8.0) days in pulse-steroid group.

Out-patients exhibiting long Covid may benefit from ambulatory rehabilitation which is, to date, poorly documented. METHODS: A longitudinal follow-up over a one-year period was conducted in two ambulatory rehabilitation structures in order to describe the characteristics of real-life patients referred with Covid-19 sequelae and their evolution over the course of rehabilitation. RESULTS: 39 consecutive patients were included from April 1(st) 2020 to April 1(st) 2021. Patients were middle-aged (4815yr), without comorbidities, and mostly mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection (25(64%) not requiring hospitalisation). Rehabilitation referral was considered with a median delay of 73[34-178] days after disease onset. Most prevalent symptoms were dyspnoea (n=35(90%)) and fatigue (n=30(77%)). Hyperventilation syndrome was highly frequent (n=12(34%)). 29(74%) patients presented with prolonged functional sequelae, which was associated with younger age (4314 vs. 5010yr; p=0.002), greater prevalence of hyperventilation syndrome (n=12(41%) vs. 0(0%); p=0.255) and poorer quality of life (VQ-11; 3110 vs. 239; p=0.030). Over the course of rehabilitation, exertional dyspnoea, 6-minutes walking distance, 3-minutes sit-to-stand test, hyperventilation syndrome prevalence and quality of life significantly improved. CONCLUSION: Hyperventilation is frequent in long Covid and may explain persistent dyspnoea as well as altered quality of life.

The use of localized negative pressure within proximity of a patient's airway is expected to reduce the amount of bioaerosols dispersed particularly for anesthesia staff who are frequently near the patient's airway. METHODS In the experiment, aerosols were produced using a polydisperse aerosol generator with nebulized saline. A portable negative pressure unit was set up at set distances of 10 cm and 30 cm with the aim of reducing aerosol particle counts detected by a laser-based particle counter. RESULTS Without the portable negative pressure unit, the median concentration of 0.5 m aerosols detected was 3128 (1533, 22832) particles/ft3/min. With the portable negative pressure unit 10 cm and 30 cm from the site of aerosol emittance, the median concentration compared with background concentration was -0.5 (-8, 8) particles/ft3/min and 398 (89, 1749) particles/ft3/min, respectively.

RESULTS: VisualCspatial/executive functions and memory domains suffered more frequently than others in the study subjects under 40 years; in patients over 40 years old memory, visualCspatial/executive functions and abstract thinking impairment prevailed the most. Such cognitive domains as memory, language, abstract thinking, visualCspatial and executive functions were impacted in both groups of patients even without the apparent cognitive decline according to MoCA scale. Presence of depression impacted language and attention more prominently than the rest of the domains only in participants younger 40 years. According to the MRI, frontal lobe, corpus callosum and periventricular area were affected more often compared to other brain regions in case of cognitive impairment; meanwhile, combined lesions of frontal lobe and corpus callosum, fronto-temporal region were associated with depression. CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment and depression are one of the common, yet disabling and socially disrupting manifestations of MS.

This report describes a novel technique for single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy. METHODS From August 2008 to October 2009, 69 consecutive patients with acute appendicitis underwent gasless single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy under epidural anesthesia at our department. An approximately 1.8-cm-long incision was made at McBurney's point. Once the abdominal wall was entered, an abdominal wall lifting device was employed in the right lower quadrant to lift up the abdominal wall to establish the operating space. Appendectomies were accomplished by use of three techniques: extracorporeally, combined extra- and intracorporeally, and intracorporeally. A drainage tube was inserted in right iliac fossa through the small incision when severe inflammation at the base of appendix or local peritonitis was present at time of operation. RESULTS Of the 69 patients, 66 underwent successful gasless single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy. In the remaining three patients the procedure was converted to open by extending the length of the incision at McBurney's point. Average operative time was 51 min (range 38-72 min). Abdominal cavity was drained in four patients. Patients resumed mobility within 24 h postoperatively. No complications occurred intraoperatively. Postoperative complication occurred in two patients: localized abscess in one, and wound infection in another; both were treated successfully with conservative management.

METHODS AND POPULATION We used in-house TaqMan multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction to test nasopharyngeal samples from 536 RTI episodes in 452 children who were admitted during the 2006-2007 winter. Twenty-one viruses, including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and RSV were tested. The amount of viral nucleic acid was recorded semiquantitatively based on the cycle threshold value. RESULTS A total of 665 positive polymerase chain reaction tests were recorded in 536 nasopharyngeal specimens. Coronavirus was found in 68 (12.7%): HCoV-OC43, n = 44 (8.2%), and HCoV-NL63, n = 24 (4.5%). Only RSV and rhinovirus were detected more frequently. Neither HCoV-229E nor HCoV-HKU1 was detected. Among children with HCoV-OC43, 73.0% tested positive for at least one other virus, compared with 41.2% with HCoV-NL63 and 40.3% with RSV (P = 0.03 and P < 0.01, respectively). Children with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 were older than children with RSV (median age, 19 vs. 10 months, P = 0.01). Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was half as common in children with HCoV-OC43 (48.6%) and HCoV-NL63 (47.1%) as in children with RSV (82.3%) (both P < 0.01).

The pre COVID-19 timeframe was defined as January C May 2019 while the during COVID-19 timeframe was January C May 2020. To compare incidence and patient characteristics between cohorts, t-tests and chi-square analysis was used. Additional sub-analysis was performed in candidemia patients during COVID-19 timeframe comparing outcomes of patients based on COVID-19 status. A Fisher Exact and Satterthwaite Test were used for analysis of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 46 cases of candidemia were identified in both the pre COVID-19 and during COVID-19 periods. Pre COVID-19, the average number of cases was 3.0  1.2 per month. The incidence more than doubled during COVID-19 to 6.2  4.2 cases per month (p = 0.14) (Figure 1). No significant differences in patient demographics were detected between cohorts, however, patients in the COVID-19 cohort had higher rates of corticosteroid use, mechanical ventilation and vasopressors (Table 1). In the 2020 period, 31 patients developed candidemia and 12 (38.7%) patients tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. On average, COVID-19 patients developed candidemia 12.1 days from admission, compared to 17.8 days in the COVID-19 negative cohort (p = 0.340). Additionally, COVID-19 patients with candidemia coinfection were significantly more likely to expire; 83.3% (n=10) COVID-19 patients expired compared to 36.8 (n=7) in the COVID-19 negative cohort (p = 0.025) (Table 2).

A more sustainable approach has turned the attention from faraway tropical forests to local wood, that is, European species. Unfortunately, most of the species are not durable;thus, in order to utilize them in outdoor conditions, protection must be provided. Stone pine (Pinus pinea) is one of the most common tree species in the Mediterranean region, with a great potential in applications with higher added value, instead of being used only for burning or packaging. This investigation explores methods for an improvement of the service life of stone pine sapwood using impregnation and modification techniques.The sudden availability of Italian stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) wood due to the infestation of pathogenic fungi and insects highlighted the need to promote its use as a short supply chain resource in Italy and other Mediterranean countries. However, the durability of stone pine sapwood must be enhanced if outdoor use is to be considered. The impregnability of stone pine wood was studied following the standard EN 351-1:2008, using immersion, vacuum, and high-pressure methods with natural waxes and organic solvent-based and copper-amino-based preservative solutions. The efficacy of the impregnation was determined by calculating the kilos of preservative absorbed per cubic meter of wood and by measuring the penetration depth of the preservative. Thermal modifications were carried out using five different maximum temperatures, and their efficacy was determined by measuring the mass loss and color change. Subsequent to thermal treatments, the wood was exposed to a water-vapor-saturated atmosphere, and the increase in mass was calculated for different periods. Stone pine and Scots pine sapwoods showed similar response to the treatments with the exception of soaking impregnation methods where stone pine showed higher uptake, in particular when Silvanolin was used. Our investigation shows that stone pine can be a suitable short supply chain resource in Italy that, when impregnated, could be tested for outdoor use, exactly as is the case with Scots pine.","output":"Influence of Thermal Modification and Impregnation with Biocides on Physical Properties of Italian Stone Pine Wood (Pinus pinea L.)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alterations in liver function test have been described in 17-50% of patients COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a survey of published NMAs on drug interventions. SETTING: NMAs indexed in PubMed (searches updated in May 2020). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Lag times were measured as the time between the last systematic search and the article submission, acceptance, online publication, indexing and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) allocation dates. Time-to-event analyses were performed considering independent variables (geographical origin, Journal Impact Factor, Scopus CiteScore, open access status) (SPSS V.24, R/RStudio). RESULTS: We included 1245 NMAs. The median time from last search to article submission was 6.8 months (204 days (IQR 95C381)), and to publication was 11.6 months. Only 5% of authors updated their search after first submission. There is a very slightly decreasing historical trend of acceptance (rho=?0.087; p=0.010), online publication (rho=?0.080; p=0.008) and indexing (rho=?0.080; p=0.007) lag times. Journal Impact Factor influenced the MeSH allocation process, but not the other lag times. The comparison between open access versus subscription journals confirmed meaningless differences in acceptance, online publication and indexing lag times. CONCLUSION: Efforts by authors to update their search before submission are needed to reduce evidence production time. Peer reviewers and editors should ensure authors compliance with NMA standards.

Therefore, comprehensive training programs for young surgeons are needed. DESIGN Retrospective study SETTING We developed a specific education program called the \\"Recruitment of Young Medical Apprentices\\" (RYOMA) project. PARTICIPANTS We performed this project between January 2008 and August 2013 on fourth- to sixth-year medical students and internship doctors. The RYOMA project included step-by-step surgical education programs on open and scopic procedures as dry, wet, and animal laboratory training. Our goal was to increase the number of young and specialist surgeons. RESULTS Based on an interview questionnaire answered by 90 medical students, most young students were interested in surgical training and several chose to become surgeons in the future. The most positive opinions regarding the field of surgery were the impressive results achieved with surgery, whereas negative opinions included the difficulty of the surgical skill, physical concerns related to difficult work environments, and the severity of surgical procedures. The present program has begun to resolve negative opinions through adequate training or simulations. Of the 19 medical students and internship doctors who attended the RYOMA project in 2008, 17 trainees (90%) were satisfied with this special surgical program and 16 (88%) showed interest in becoming surgeons. The number of participants considering the field of surgery increased between 2008 and 2013. Of 23 participants, 19 (83%) had a positive opinion of the program after the training.

In the current Serbian and Croatian political conceptions, Bosnia and Herzegovina is treated as a ? sphere of interest\\", which should be mastered as much as possible in peace, if it did not succeed in the war. Serbia and Croatia, in the historical sense, since they have existed as political entities, have been opposed to each other in almost everything. The only thing on which there was a high degree of agreement was the question of the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina, again depending on historical circumstances and other circumstances.

In the last few years, intensive cooperation and a high degree of ? agreement\\" between Serbian and Croatian politics have been noticed, again ? regarding\\" Bosnia and Herzegovina, its status and the definitive post-Dayton division. In this sense, it is not difficult to recognize several common characteristics of both policies. In this article, the author focuses on the following: The first is a declarative and formal public declaration of both to respect the integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while in practical politics this sovereignty is continuously violated and ? trampled\\", acting as its ? rulers\\". Another common feature is the belittling and labeling of all pro-Bosnian political forces, reducing them to ? political Sarajevo\\" in the pejorative sense of the word, with multiple offensive and deeper meanings, which, in addition to Milorad Dodik (to make the absurd even greater, as president or member of the Presidency of BiH) from the Serbian one, Zoran Milanovi?, the current president of Croatia, until yesterday a declared friend of Bosnia and the pro-Bosnian SDP, is increasingly expressing himself in his own way. Obstruction of the process of reforms and rapprochement of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the European Union and NATO membership is the third session of the characteristics of Serbian and Croatian politics (albeit in different versions), while the fourth, denial of decisions and verdicts of the Hague Tribunal for crimes and atrocities is dominant over Bosniaks (again in a different version): Serbs deny genocide verdicts, and Croats deny convictions for the Joint Criminal Enterprise. In addition to common characteristics, this paper highlights some special features of the current Serbian and Croatian policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, which, again, boils down to one goal: To strengthen (make independent) the Republika Srpska and cantons with a Croat majority, as well as the position of Croats in Federation with the aim offorming a third entity and at the same time weaken the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina until the question of the meaning of its existence is raised. The state's inability to organize the procurement of coronavirus vaccines is just one of the latest proofs that these destructive political forces have succeeded to a great extent. This article points out the consequences of such a policy and emphasizes the need to stop further degradation and collapse of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state.

However, despite the initial dramatic responses, the emergence of acquired resistance is inevitable. Acquisition of secondary mutations in the target gene (on-target resistance) is one of the major mechanisms of resistance. The mouse pro-B cell line Ba/F3 is dependent on interleukin-3 for survival and proliferation. Upon transduction of a driver gene, Ba/F3 cells become independent of interleukin-3 but dependent on the transduced driver gene. Therefore, the Ba/F3 cell line has been a popular system to generate models with oncogene dependence and vulnerability to specific targeted therapies. These models have been used to estimate oncogenicity of driver mutations or efficacies of molecularly targeted drugs. In addition, Ba/F3 models, together with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, have been used to derive acquired resistant cells to investigate on-target resistance mechanisms. Here, we reviewed studies that used Ba/F3 models with EGFR mutations, ALK/ROS1/NTRK/RET fusions, MET exon 14 skipping mutations, or KRAS G12C mutations to investigate secondary/tertiary drug resistant mutations. We demonstrated that 68% of resistance mutations reproducibly detected in clinical cases were also found in Ba/F3 models.

However, little is known about the causes of death and the virus's pathologic features. OBJECTIVE: To validate and compare clinical findings with data from medical autopsy, virtual autopsy, and virologic tests. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Autopsies performed at a single academic medical center, as mandated by the German federal state of Hamburg for patients dying with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS: The first 12 consecutive COVID-19-positive deaths. MEASUREMENTS: Complete autopsy, including postmortem computed tomography and histopathologic and virologic analysis, was performed. Clinical data and medical course were evaluated. RESULTS: Median patient age was 73 years (range, 52 to 87 years), 75% of patients were male, and death occurred in the hospital (n = 10) or outpatient sector (n = 2). Coronary heart disease and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most common comorbid conditions (50% and 25%, respectively). Autopsy revealed deep venous thrombosis in 7 of 12 patients (58%) in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death; pulmonary embolism was the direct cause of death in 4 patients. Postmortem computed tomography revealed reticular infiltration of the lungs with severe bilateral, dense consolidation, whereas histomorphologically diffuse alveolar damage was seen in 8 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the lung at high concentrations; viremia in 6 of 10 and 5 of 12 patients demonstrated high viral RNA titers in the liver, kidney, or heart.

Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months. Findings We found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15% (n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15) were S1-IgG- borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs (kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months.

In childhood, cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) occurs almost exclusively. It is confined to the skin, and has a good prognosis. The most common form is the maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), formerly called urticaria pigmentosa. A distinction is made between a monomorphic variant of MPCM with multiple small, roundish maculopapular skin lesions and the C more common C polymorphic variant with larger lesions of variable size. One quarter of CM diagnosed in childhood are mastocytomas, which often occur solitary or at multiple sites. The diffuse variant of CM (DCM), which affects 5% of children with CM, should be distinguished from these forms. Systemic mastocytoses (SM) with mast cell infiltrates in the bone marrow or other extracutaneous tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, occur predominantly in adults. The diagnosis of CM is usually made clinically: Manifestation in infancy, typical morphology and distribution, pathognomonic Darier sign. Basal serum tryptase is determined if DCM or systemic mastocytosis are to be diagnosed. Children with mastocytosis should be managed in a specialized outpatient clinic.

Two vaccine types were developed using two different technologies: viral vectors and mRNA. Thrombosis is one of the most severe and atypical adverse effects of vaccines. This study aimed to analyze published cases of thrombosis after COVID-19 vaccinations to identify patients features, potential pathophysiological mechanisms, timing of appearance of the adverse events, and other critical issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic electronic search of scientific articles regarding COVID-19 vaccine-related thrombosis and its complications on the PubMed (MEDLINE) database and through manual searches. We selected 10 out of 50 articles from February 1 to May 5, 2021 and performed a descriptive analysis of the adverse events caused by the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the adenovirus-based AstraZeneca vaccine. RESULTS: In the articles on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the sample consisted of three male patients with age heterogeneity. The time from vaccination to admission was 3 days in all cases; all patients presented signs of petechiae/purpura at admission, with a low platelet count. In the studies on the AstraZeneca vaccine, the sample consisted of 58 individuals with a high age heterogeneity and a high female prevalence. Symptoms appeared around the ninth day, and headache was the most common symptom. The platelet count was below the lower limit of the normal range. All patients except one were positive for PF4 antibodies. The cerebral venous sinus was the most affected site. Death was the most prevalent outcome in all studies, except for one study in which most of the patients remained alive. DISCUSSION: Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is an unknown nosological phenomenon secondary to inoculation with the COVID-19 vaccine. Several hypotheses have been formulated regarding its physiopathological mechanism. Recent studies have assumed a mechanism that is assimilable to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with protagonist antibodies against the PF4Cpolyanion complex. Viral DNA has a negative charge and can bind to PF4, causing VITT. New experimental studies have assumed that thrombosis is related to a soluble adenoviral protein spike variant, originating from splicing events, which cause important endothelial inflammatory events, and binding to endothelial cells expressing ACE2. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to better identify VITTs pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic, demographic, or clinical predisposition of high-risk patients, to investigate the correlation of VITT with the different vaccine types, and to test the significance of the findings.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Thrombosis: A Systematic Review and Exploratory Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an acute respiratory disease with systemic complications.

We characterized two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional models (3D) to establish a physiologically relevant airway epithelial model with potential for investigating SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Human airway basal epithelial cells maintained in submerged 2D culture were used at low passage to retain the capacity to differentiate into ciliated, club, and goblet cells in both air-liquid interface culture (ALI) and airway organoid cultures, which were then analyzed for cell phenotype makers. Airway biopsies from non-asthmatic and asthmatic donors enabled comparative evaluation of the level and distribution of immunoreactive angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 and transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2) mRNA were expressed in ALI and airway organoids at levels similar to those of native (i.e., non-cultured) human bronchial epithelial cells, whereas furin expression was more faithfully represented in ALI. ACE2 was mainly localized to ciliated and basal epithelial cells in human airway biopsies, ALI, and airway organoids. Cystic fibrosis appeared to have no influence on ACE2 gene expression. Neither asthma nor smoking status had consistent marked influence on the expression or distribution of ACE2 in airway biopsies.

Uganda hosts over 1.43 million refugees, and more than 83,000 live in Kampala, largely in informal settlements. There is limited information about HIV testing uptake and preferences among urban refugee and displaced youth. HIV self-testing is a promising method for increasing testing uptake. Further, mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been effective in increasing HIV testing uptake and could be particularly useful among youth. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of two HIV self-testing implementation strategies (HIV self-testing intervention alone and HIV self-testing combined with an mHealth intervention) in comparison with the HIV testing standard of care in terms of HIV testing outcomes among refugee/displaced youth aged 16 to 24 years in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: A three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be implemented across five informal settlements grouped into three sites, based on proximity, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1:1 method. Approximately 450 adolescents (150 per cluster) will be enrolled and followed for 12 months. Data will be collected at the following three time points: baseline enrollment, 8 months after enrollment, and 12 months after enrollment. Primary outcomes (HIV testing frequency, HIV status knowledge, linkage to confirmatory testing, and linkage to HIV care) and secondary outcomes (depression, condom use efficacy, consistent condom use, sexual relationship power, HIV stigma, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health stigma) will be evaluated. RESULTS: The study has been conducted in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. The study has received ethical approval from the University of Toronto (June 14, 2019), Mildmay Uganda (November 11, 2019), and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (August 3, 2020).

For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators. Author summary The threat posed by infectious diseases has a huge impact on our global society. It is therefore critical to monitor infectious diseases as new data become available during control campaigns. One obstacle in observing disease emergence or elimination is understanding what influences noise in the data and how this fluctuates when near to zero cases. The standard data type collected is the number of new cases per day/month/year but mathematical modellers often focus on data such as the total number of infectious people, due to its analytical properties. We have developed a methodology to monitor the standard type of data to inform whether a disease is approaching emergence or disease elimination. We have shown computationally how fluctuations change as disease data get closer towards a tipping point and our insights highlight how these observed changes can be strikingly different when calculated on different types of data.","output":"Prospects for detecting early warning signals in discrete event sequence data: application to epidemiological incidence data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non\\\\steroidal anti\\\\inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other eicosanoid pathway modifiers are among the most ubiquitously used medications in the general population.

Ray and A. Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that Bmal1 and Clock transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Zeitgeber Time (ZT)6 and ZT17. After forty-eight hours, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at ZT6 compared to ZT17. The high virus amount at ZT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1 and IL-10 compared to ZT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression. Importance The implication of circadian rhythm (CR) in pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently anticipated. The time of day of infection is critical for illness progression as reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. In this study, we wondered if SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production by human monocytes, innate immune cells affected by Covid-19, were regulated by CR.

Although the spread of COVID-19 content has been described for several social media platforms (eg, Twitter and Facebook), little is known about how such content is spread via private messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp (WhatsApp LLC). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we documented (1) how WhatsApp is used to transmit COVID-19 content, (2) the characteristics of WhatsApp users based on their usage patterns, and (3) how usage patterns link to COVID-19 concerns. METHODS: We used the experience sampling method to track day-to-day WhatsApp usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. For 1 week, participants reported each day the extent to which they had received, forwarded, or discussed COVID-19 content. The final data set comprised 924 data points, which were collected from 151 participants. RESULTS: During the weeklong monitoring process, most participants (143/151, 94.7%) reported at least 1 COVID-19Crelated use of WhatsApp. When a taxonomy was generated based on usage patterns, around 1 in 10 participants (21/151, 13.9%) were found to have received and shared a high volume of forwarded COVID-19 content, akin to super-spreaders identified on other social media platforms.

Policies restricting social contact and human interaction pose a risk to mental health, but we know very little about the impact of shielding and stay at home orders on the mental health of older people. Aims: Understand the extent to which shielding contributes to poorer mental health. Method: Exploiting longitudinal data from Wave 9 (2018/19) and two COVID-19 sub-studies (June/July 2020; November/December 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing we use logistic and linear regression models to investigate associations between patterns of shielding during the pandemic and mental health, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, pre-pandemic physical and mental health, and social isolation measures. Results: By December 2020, 70% of older people were still shielding or staying at home, with 5% shielding throughout the first 9 months of the pandemic. Respondents who shielded experienced worse mental health. Although prior characteristics and lack of social interactions explain some of this association, even controlling for all covariates, those shielding throughout had higher odds of reporting elevated depressive symptoms (OR=1.87, 95%CI=1.22;2.87) and reported lower quality of life (B=-1.28, 95%CI=-2.04;-0.52) than those who neither shielded nor stayed at home.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce the risk of HIV infection by 99% among men who have sex with men, yet profound racial disparities in the uptake of PrEP persist. Low PrEP uptake in BMSM is driven by poor access to PrEP, including inconvenient locations of PrEP-prescribing physicians, distrust of physicians, and stigma, which limit communication about PrEP and its side effects. Previous work indicates that offering HIV prevention services in pharmacies located in low-income, underserved neighborhoods is feasible and can reduce stigma because pharmacies offer a host of less stigmatized health services (eg, vaccinations). We present a protocol for a pharmacy PrEP model that seeks to address challenges and barriers to pharmacy-based PrEP specifically for BMSM. OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop a sustainable pharmacy PrEP delivery model for BMSM that can be implemented to increase PrEP access in low-income, underserved neighborhoods. METHODS: This study design is a pilot intervention to test a pharmacy PrEP delivery model among pharmacy staff and BMSM. We will examine the PrEP delivery models feasibility, acceptability, and safety and gather early evidence of its impact and cost with respect to PrEP uptake. A mixed-methods approach will be performed, including three study phases: (1) a completed formative phase with qualitative interviews from key stakeholders; (2) a completed transitional pilot phase to assess customer eligibility and willingness to receive PrEP in pharmacies during COVID-19; and (3) a planned pilot intervention phase which will test the delivery model in 2 Atlanta pharmacies in low-income, underserved neighborhoods. RESULTS: Data from the formative phase showed strong support of pharmacy-based PrEP delivery among BMSM, pharmacists, and pharmacy staff. Important factors were identified to facilitate the implementation of PrEP screening and dissemination in pharmacies. During the transitional pilot phase, we identified 81 individuals who would have been eligible for the pilot phase. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacies have proven to be a feasible source for offering PrEP for White men who have sex with men but have failed to reach the most at-risk, vulnerable population (ie, BMSM).

The objective of this study was to report the clinical profile, short-term and long-term outcomes of dengue among renal transplant recipients. METHODS A total of 59 post-transplant dengue suspected cases were admitted from July 2019 to April 2020 of which 31 had confirmed dengue infection. The clinical and laboratory profile of the confirmed dengue cases (n = 31) were compared with non-dengue cases (n = 28). RESULTS Among the clinical and laboratory features retro-orbital pain, conjunctival redness, thrombocytopenia on admission and absence of arthralgia were significantly associated with dengue compared to non-dengue cases. No mortality was observed in the dengue cases. Allograft dysfunction, acute rejection and graft losses were identified in 64.5% (n=20), 6.4% (n = 2) and 6.4% (n= 2) dengue cases respectively. No rejection or graft losses were observed in 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We report a differential clinical profile for dengue in transplant settings which will aid in the diagnosis.

The study was aimed to examine the intention to leave work and its relationship with job burnout among midwives working at Ayatollah Mousavi hospital of Zanjan one year after the Covid-19 disease. In a descriptive-analytical study, the tendency of 88 midwives to leave their jobs was evaluated one year after the outbreak of Covid disease in 2021. The midwives were selected by convenience sampling methods. Data were collected using the Maslach burnout questionnaire and Attwood and Hinshaw tendency to leave the job. Data analyzed by descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, Pearson correlation coefficient, multiple linear regression model with the stepwise method at 95% confidence level. Results: : The mean tendency to leave the job was 29.71  6.75. Most of the midwives have a moderate level of the tendency to leave the job (47.7%). There was a significant positive correlation between all three components of burnout and the tendency to leave the job. The odds of leaving the job were 0.344 times higher in people with high emotional fatigue and 0.276 times in people with rotational shift work.

METHOD The sample consisted of 682 families (2,046 participants) with two adolescent siblings (older siblings: Mage = 15.67 years, 51% female; younger siblings: Mage = 13.14 years, 48% female) and one parent (Mage = 45.15 years; 85% female) from five Midwestern U.S. states. Siblings reported on their own drinking and social disruption stress before and during the onset of the pandemic via online surveys. RESULTS Accounting for younger siblings' earlier drinking and other confounders, older siblings' prepandemic drinking predicted a greater likelihood of younger siblings' drinking during the Spring 2020 pandemic shutdown. This association was not moderated by younger siblings' social disruption stress. The association between younger siblings' prepandemic drinking and older siblings' drinking during the shutdown was moderated by older siblings' social disruption stress. Specifically, younger siblings' earlier drinking was more strongly related to older siblings' drinking during the shutdown if older siblings reported more social disruption stress. CONCLUSIONS Siblings are important socialization agents of alcohol use during adolescence.

Thus, by using computerized tomography, we aimed to define the baseline of the weight and body composition during the adolescence and young adulthood of female and male SpragueCDawley rats (on P30, P60 and P90) under standard diet. Then, we determined the effect of 18 days of forced exercise on the body weight and composition during the early adolescence (P27-45). The highest percentual increments in weight, body volume and relative adipose contents occurred during the female and male adolescence. Forced running during the early adolescence decreased weight, body volume and relative adipose delta and increment values in males only.

METHODS: From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at a tertiary care hospital in Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for 3 months from admission. RESULTS: We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61% vs. 67%) and had at least one comorbidity (68% vs. 85%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18%] vs. 15 [45%], p=.03 and 1 [4%] vs. 10 [30%], p=.008). In chest X-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68%] and 7 [21%], p<.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93%] vs. 19 [58%], p=.003 and 8 [29%] vs. 2 [6%], p=.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (six days [IQR 4-21] vs. 3 [2-4], p<.001).

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of HFNC in patients with COVID-19 published in English from January 1st, 2020 to August 15th, 2021. The primary aim was to assess intubation, mortality, and failure rates in COVID-19 patients supported by HFNC. Secondary aims were to compare HFNC success and failure groups and to describe the risk factors for HFNC failure. RESULTS: A total of 25 studies fulfilled selection criteria and included 2851 patients. The intubation, mortality, and failure rates were 0.44 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38C0.51, I(2) = 84%), 0.23 (95% CI: 0.19C0.29, I(2) = 88%), and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.42C0.51, I(2) = 56%), respectively. Compared to the success group, age, body mass index (BMI), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, D-dimer, lactate, heart rate, and respiratory rate were higher and PaO(2), PaO(2)/FiO(2), ROX index (the ratio of SpO(2)/FiO(2) to respiratory rate), ROX index after the initiation of HFNC, and duration of HFNC were lower in the failure group (all Ps < 0.05). There were also more smokers and more comorbidities in the failure group (all Ps < 0.05). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) revealed that older age (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01C1.07, P = 0.02, I(2) = 88%), a higher white blood cell (WBC) count (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01C1.12, P = 0.02, I(2) = 0%), a higher heart rate (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.15C1.76, P < 0.01, I(2) = 0%), and a lower ROX index(OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39C0.95, P = 0.03, I(2) = 93%) after the initiation of HFNC were all significant risk factors for HFNC failure.

The aim of this study was to assess the intensity of stress and coping strategies applied by nurses working with both infected and non-infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted between January and March 2021. Due to the epidemiological situation, the questionnaire was posted on Facebook in nurses groups and sent out via the Messenger and WhatsApp applications. Stress intensity was assessed by means of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), whereas coping strategies were assessed using the Mini-COPE stress coping inventory. Results: Among 151 surveyed nurses, more than half (52.3%) worked with infected patients and the remaining ones (47.7%) worked with non-infected patients. The level of stress perceived by nurses working with infected patients was higher than among nurses working with patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (22.22  5.94 vs. 20.21  5.68, p = 0.03). The nurses working with infected patients were most likely to choose coping strategies focused on the problem (2.00  0.62) and emotions (2.01  0.69), whereas those working with non-infected patients usually chose strategies focused only on the problem (2.11  0.58). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses working with SARS-CoV-2 patients experienced more intense stress than those working with non-infected patients.

A few reports suggest the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from mothers to their neonates. Most neonates have mild symptoms, but some develop multisystem involvement and shock. Case Presentation: We report two cases of possible SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission from mothers to their neonates. The first case shows maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the second trimester followed by recurrent infection in the third trimester right before the delivery. The infant demonstrated respiratory distress soon after delivery along with myocardial dysfunction and multi-organ system involvement. The second case shows maternal infection with SARS-COV-2 at the time of delivery with preterm labor secondary to placental abruption, with that delivery resulting in the preterm neonate requiring non-invasive ventilation with multisystem involvement in the context of persistently positive SARS-COV-2 PCR in the neonate. Both neonates were treated with IVIG along with steroids. Both neonates recovered fully and were discharged and allowed to go home. Conclusion: In neonates, COVID-19 usually presents as an asymptomatic or mild illness; some may develop a more severe course.

This study aimed to capture key data on children and adolescents with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across Europe to inform physicians and health-care service planning during the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: This multicentre cohort study involved 82 participating health-care institutions across 25 European countries, using a well established research networkthe Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet)that mainly comprises paediatric infectious diseases specialists and paediatric pulmonologists. We included all individuals aged 18 years or younger with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected at any anatomical site by RT-PCR, between April 1 and April 24, 2020, during the initial peak of the European COVID-19 pandemic. We explored factors associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and initiation of drug treatment for COVID-19 using univariable analysis, and applied multivariable logistic regression with backwards stepwise analysis to further explore those factors significantly associated with ICU admission. FINDINGS: 582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, with a median age of 50 years (IQR 05C120) and a sex ratio of 115 males per female. 145 (25%) had pre-existing medical conditions. 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to hospital. 48 (8%) individuals required ICU admission, 25 (4%) mechanical ventilation (median duration 7 days, IQR 2C11, range 1C34), 19 (3%) inotropic support, and one (<1%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Significant risk factors for requiring ICU admission in multivariable analyses were being younger than 1 month (odds ratio 506, 95% CI 172C1487; p=00035), male sex (212, 106C421; p=0033), pre-existing medical conditions (327, 167C642; p=00015), and presence of lower respiratory tract infection signs or symptoms at presentation (1046, 516C2123; p<00001). The most frequently used drug with antiviral activity was hydroxychloroquine (40 [7%] patients), followed by remdesivir (17 [3%] patients), lopinavirCritonavir (six [1%] patients), and oseltamivir (three [1%] patients). Immunomodulatory medication used included corticosteroids (22 [4%] patients), intravenous immunoglobulin (seven [1%] patients), tocilizumab (four [1%] patients), anakinra (three [1%] patients), and siltuximab (one [<1%] patient). Four children died (case-fatality rate 069%, 95% CI 020C182); at study end, the remaining 578 were alive and only 25 (4%) were still symptomatic or requiring respiratory support. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including infants. However, a small proportion develop severe disease requiring ICU admission and prolonged ventilation, although fatal outcome is overall rare. The data also reflect the current uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.

One of the first symptoms to occur is nasal congestion, which can have a negative impact on daily life and prompts many patients to seek treatment for relief. Xylometazoline nasal spray (Otrivin*) is a topical decongestant that has been used successfully for many years and is generally recognized as an effective and safe therapy. However, most studies have investigated its clinical efficacy in healthy patients and few have included patients with common cold. SCOPE To review the published clinical efficacy and safety of xylometazoline alone and in combination in the management of nasal congestion in patients with common cold. Literature searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library were conducted to obtain published open or blinded, randomized, placebo- or active-controlled studies on the use of xylometazoline hydrochloride for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion in patients with common cold. Searches included papers published in English only, up to September 2009. FINDINGS Despite the small number of studies identified in common cold (n = 4), as per search criteria defined, intranasal xylometazoline quickly and effectively relieved nasal congestion. When used alone, xylometazoline had a clinically relevant decongestant effect that was significantly superior for up to 10 hours compared with placebo. The superior decongestant effect with xylometazoline led to high patient satisfaction with treatment. When used in combination with ipratropium bromide, nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea were treated simultaneously, leading to significantly higher patient general impression scores compared with either agent used alone. Xylometazoline was well tolerated, with generally mild to moderate nasal-related side effects (e.g. epistaxis in 3.4% of patients, and blood-tinged mucus in 10-26% of patients) that were easily resolved; the most frequently reported non-nasal AEs were headache (3.4%) and period pain (10.3%); no cases of sedation were reported. As expected, no rhinitis medicamentosa or rebound congestion was noted with short-term use (<10 days). No clinically important differences in ciliary motility and mucociliary clearance were observed. Xylometazoline does not result in sympathomimetic systemic side effects seen with oral decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine). CONCLUSIONS The few studies available in common cold suggest that intranasal xylometazoline provides fast and effective relief of nasal congestion and is well tolerated. When xylometazoline is used in combination with ipratropium, patients with common cold experience the additive benefit of nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea being treated simultaneously.","output":"Effects of intranasal xylometazoline, alone or in combination with ipratropium, in patients with common cold."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although SARS had been with a controversial topic for a decade at the time of this study, numerous SARS survivors had not yet physically, psychologically or socially recovered from the aftermath of SARS. Among chronically ill patients, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is reported to be widespread. However, extremely little is known about the use of CAM by SARS survivors in the post-SARS period and even less is known about how the use of CAM is related to the unpleasant social and medical-treatment experiences of SARS survivors, their eagerness to re-establish social networks, and their awareness to prepare for future epidemics. OBJECTIVE To investigate the motivations for practising tai chi among SARS survivors in post-SARS Hong Kong. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Using a qualitative approach, I conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 35 SARS survivors, who were purposively sampled from a tai chi class of a SARS-patient self-help group in Hong Kong. RESULTS Health concerns and social experiences motivated the participants to practise tai chi in post-SARS Hong Kong. Experiencing health deterioration in relation to SARS-associated sequelae, coping with unpleasant experiences during follow-up biomedical treatments, a desire to regain an active role in recovery and rehabilitation, overcoming SARS-associated stigmas by establishing a new social network and preparing for potential future stigmatization and discrimination were the key motivators for them.

METHODS: We performed this prospective cross-sectional observational study in a multi-site London hospital. Air and surface samples were collected from seven clinical areas, occupied by patients with COVID-19, and a public area of the hospital. Three or four 1.0 m3 air samples were collected in each area using an active air sampler. Surface samples were collected by swabbing items in the immediate vicinity of each air sample. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-qPCR and viral culture; the limit of detection for culturing SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces was determined. RESULTS: Viral RNA was detected on 114/218 (52.3%) of surfaces and 14/31 (38.7%) air samples but no virus was cultured. The proportion of surface samples contaminated with viral RNA varied by item sampled and by clinical area. Viral RNA was detected on surfaces and in air in public areas of the hospital but was more likely to be found in areas immediately occupied by COVID-19 patients than in other areas (67/105 (63.8%) vs. 29/64 (45.3%) (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.9, p=0.025, Chi squared test)).

We distinguish between ?problem? (COVID-19) and ?solutions?

We find that overall attention to COVID-19 was not driven by endogenous dynamics between the different actors. By contrast, the debate on face masks was led by the attentive public and by politicians, whereas parties and newspapers followed.

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from faecal samples and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need. Methods: : We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had faecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial faecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the faecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters. Results: : Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in faecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Faecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harboured more stress-, inflammation- and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, Pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age;5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects. Conclusions: Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.","output":"Temporal landscape of human gut RNA and DNA virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the fitness landscape of viral mutations is crucial for uncovering the evolutionary mechanisms contributing to pandemic behavior.

AIMS: To investigate whether rates of depressive symptomatology increased in caregivers during COVID-19 and whether the unintended consequences of health protective measures, i.e., social isolation, exacerbated this risk. Another aim was to see if caregivers accessed any online/phone psychological support during COVID. METHOD: Data (1349 caregivers; 6178 non-caregivers) was extracted from Understanding Society, a UK population-level data-set. The General Health Questionnaire cut-off scores identified those who are likely to have depression. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding caregivers had a higher risk of having depressive symptoms compared with non-caregivers, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22 (95% CI 1.05C1.40, P = 0.008) evidenced by higher levels of depression pre-COVID-19 (16.7% caregivers v. 12.1% non-caregivers) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (21.6% caregivers v. 17.9% non-caregivers), respectively.

In particular we found variation within the OAS1 (meta-OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69-1.00) and CCR5 (meta-OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08-1.53) genes is significantly associated with West Nile virus disease, while variation within MICB (meta-OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.68-3.29), PLCE1 (meta-OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.42-0.71), MBL2 (meta-OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.02-2.31), and IFN- (meta-OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.30-4.71), is associated with dengue disease. CONCLUSIONS Despite substantial heterogeneity in populations studied, genes examined, and methodology, significant associations with genetic variants were found across studies within both diseases. These gene associations suggest a key role for immune mechanisms in susceptibility to severe disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis and may reveal additional genetic factors associated with disease severity.","output":"Identification of genetic variants associated with dengue or West Nile virus disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virus causing coronavirus disease is transmitted through droplets that are released by an infected person when he/she coughs, sneezes, or exhales People get infected by either breathing in the droplets through atmosphere if they are released by an infected person nearby or by touching a surface which has been contaminated by the virus Most of the people who get infected suffer mild to moderate symptoms However, people with severe symptoms develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD) characterized by rapid onset of inflammation in the lungs It can cause serious conditions such as blood clots, multi-organ failures etc to happen suddenly sometimes even leading to death of the patient In other words, COVID-19 affects our lungs with adverse infection due to which a person is unable to breathe with decorum The broad aim of this research paper is to study the CT scan images of patients infected from coronavirus and compare them to the CT scan images of patients which may be not be infected or may have normal pneumonia (i e not due to coronavirus) Further, the authors have devised models using Support Vector Machine and Convolutional Neural Network to differentiate between the CT scan images of coronavirus infected patients and the patients who are not infected ? 2021 CEUR-WS All rights reserved","output":"Detection of covid-19 using the ct scan image of lungs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper adopts the GDYN model to estimate the dynamic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global manufacturing industry and the value chain.

Our aim was to provide a comprehensive account of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in England during the early phase of the pandemic and to identify the factors that influenced mortality as the pandemic evolved. METHODS: This was a retrospective exploratory analysis using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset. All patients aged 18 years or older in England who completed a hospital stay (were discharged alive or died) between March 1 and May 31, 2020, and had a diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission or during their stay were included. In-hospital death was the primary outcome of interest. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the relationship between death and several covariates: age, sex, deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation), ethnicity, frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score), presence of comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index items), and date of discharge (whether alive or deceased). FINDINGS: 91a??541 adult patients with COVID-19 were discharged during the study period, among which 28a??200 (308%) in-hospital deaths occurred. The final multilevel logistic regression model accounted for age, deprivation score, and date of discharge as continuous variables, and sex, ethnicity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index items as categorical variables. In this model, significant predictors of in-hospital death included older age (modelled using restricted cubic splines), male sex (1457 [1408-1509]), greater deprivation (1002 [1001-1003]), Asian (1211 [1128-1299]) or mixed ethnicity (1317 [1080-1605]; vs White ethnicity), and most of the assessed comorbidities, including moderate or severe liver disease (5433 [4618-6392]). Later date of discharge was associated with a lower odds of death (0977 [0976-0978]); adjusted in-hospital mortality improved significantly in a broadly linear fashion, from 522% in the first week of March to 168% in the last week of May. INTERPRETATION: Reductions in the adjusted probability of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients over time might reflect the impact of changes in hospital strategy and clinical processes. The reasons for the observed improvements in mortality should be thoroughly investigated to inform the response to future outbreaks. The higher mortality rate reported for certain ethnic minority groups in community-based studies compared with our hospital-based analysis might partly reflect differential infection rates in those at greatest risk, propensity to become severely ill once infected, and health-seeking behaviours.

We estimated how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China, over a one- and five-year time horizon. METHODS: Regional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of all sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%), but initial data indicated no change in viral suppression. A mathematical model of HIV transmission/treatment among MSM was used to estimate the impact of disruptions on HIV infections/HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over one and five years for 3/4/6-month disruption periods, starting from 1 January 2020. RESULTS: Our model predicted new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions (25% virally suppressed MSM stop taking ART) for a three-month period increasing HIV infections by 5% to 14% over one year and deaths by 7% to 12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5% to 14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility HIV testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11% to 23% fewer infections and 0.4% to 1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods (4/6 months) amplified the impact of disruption scenarios. When realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections occurred over one year (3% to 17%), but not for five years (1% increase to 4% decrease), whereas deaths mostly increased over one year (1% to 2%) and five years (1.2 increase to 0.3 decrease). CONCLUSIONS: The overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19-related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.","output":"The impact of disruptions due to COVID-19 on HIV transmission and control among men who have sex with men in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the world is affected by an outbreak of a new disease named COVID-19, which is an acronym of 'coronavirus disease 2019'.

This perception changed in time due to occurrence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV in 2012, both inducing an epidemic severe viral pneumonia with potentially respiratory failure and numerous extra-pulmonary manifestations. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is likewise a causative pathogen for severe viral pneumonia with the risk of progression to respiratory failure and systemic manifestations. In this review, we will give a summary of the neurological manifestations due to SARS and MERS, as those might predict the neurological outcome in the novel COVID-19.

Affective response following sedentary time may influence motivation to remain sedentary. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a real-time data capture methodology that can be used to identify factors influencing sedentary time, such as the context of the home setting, and resulting affective state within a free-living setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between context at home and adolescent sedentary time, and the relationship of sedentary time and subsequent affect. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 284; 10-16 y) participated in an EMA study that used random, interval-based sampling methods. Adolescents each received 22 unannounced surveys over 7-days through a smartphone application. One survey was randomly sent within each 2-h time-period. These time-periods occurred between 4:00 pm-8:00 pm on weekdays and 8:00 am-8:00 pm on the weekend. This 15-question survey included a series of questions on context (indoors/outdoors, alone/not alone) and positive affect. Adolescents concurrently wore an accelerometer at the hip, and the 30-min bout of accelerometry data prior to each survey was used in analyses. Mixed-effect location scale models were used to examine the association between context at home and sedentary time (stage 1) and the adjusted sedentary time and positive affect (stage 2), with each model adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Adolescents were 12.6  1.9 y of age on average, about half were White (58%), and engaged in high levels of sedentary behavior during the 30 min prior to the survey (21.4  6.8 min). Most surveys occurred when adolescents were with others (59%) and indoors (88%). In Stage 1, both being alone and being indoors at home were positively associated with sedentary time (p < 0.001 for both). In Stage 2, adjusted sedentary time was not related to positive affect. Age was negatively related to positive affect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both contextual factors, being alone and indoors at home, were related to additional time spent sedentary compared to being with someone or outdoors. After adjustment, sedentary time was not related to subsequent positive affect, indicating other factors may be related to adolescent's positive affect in home settings.","output":"Adolescents' sedentary time, affect, and contextual factors: An ecological momentary assessment study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The H9N2 virus continues to spread in wild birds and poultry worldwide.

The present study was carried out to investigate the origins, zoonotic potential, as well as the impact of vaccination on the molecular evolution of Moroccan H9N2 viruses. Twenty-eight (28) H9N2 viruses collected from 2016 to 2021 in Moroccan poultry flocks were isolated and their whole genomes sequenced.

EXPERT OPINION: Prophylactic reduction of immunosuppression because of fear of COVID-19 is not suggested in SOT patients. With maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, corticosteroids can be continued during COVID-19. Continuing other immunosuppressive drugs with lowest effective dose/blood concentration is suggested for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Discontinuation of antimetabolites and perhaps inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is suggested in moderate to severe COVID-19. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) may be continued or substituted for mTOR inhibitors with lowest therapeutic concentrations in moderate to severe COVID-19. If continued in patients with COVID-19, therapeutic drug monitoring of CNIs/mTOR inhibitors and appropriate dose reduction is recommended in co-administration with protease inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, or interleukin (IL)-1/IL-6 receptor antagonists. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended in patients who continue taking antimetabolites or mTOR inhibitors.

A SEIR compartmental model was used for the curve fitting by updating the estimation per wave. In the current vaccination pace of 1/1000, restrictions (state of emergency in Japan) would be repeated 4 times until the end of next March. In the case of 1/500, another round of restriction would be required in the summer 2021, after which the infection would be mitigated. In the case of 1/250, there would be no need for restriction after the current spring restriction. The scenario of completing the vaccination of 110 million people by the end of March 2020 corresponds to the case of 1/250 in this curve.

Efforts to manage this communicable disease and its impact on the health-care system without prior development of specific vaccines have put a strain on the fiscal budget. This study aims to indicatively quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the Dutch governments fiscal position, simultaneously indicating the value of preventive vaccines from a payer perspective. Methods: Dutch COVID-19 specific population data on laboratory-confirmed infections, hospital admissions and mortality, was collected from the domestic start of the COVID-19 pandemic on 27 February 2020 until the first administered vaccine on 6 January 2021. A fiscal health modelling approach was used to estimate the loss in tax revenues. Occurred productivity losses were added as an indicator for the future burden on the social security system. Tax revenue losses were caused by premature mortality, whereas the productivity losses occurred through mortality as well as morbidity. Outcomes were expressed in total monetary impact (, 2020). Results: The impact of the pandemic in the analysed time-period was estimated to amount to a total of 920.7 million. Tax loss due to premature mortality amounted to 58.8 million with 50% attributed to patients >60 years. Productivity loss due to morbidity summed up to 862 million with 46% due to patients 40-59 years. Conclusions: The fiscal impact of the current pandemic highlights the importance of a broader approach to health-economic analysis. A fiscal health framework, optimally linked to a disease simulation model, is a better instrument to inform decision-making in the context of communicable diseases. The reported fiscal estimates also highlight the benefit of investments in communicable disease prevention such as anticipative development of vaccines. In the decision-making process around pandemic preparedness measures, investment funding and real-options can consequently be informed by a fiscal health framework.","output":"P53 The Early Lessons of COVID-19: The Need for a Broader Health-Economic Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Discussions of scope of practice among family physicians has become a crucial topic amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with new attention to residency training requirements. Family medicine has seen a gradual narrowing of practice due to a host of issues, including physician choice, expanding scope of practice from physician assistants and nurses, an increased emphasis on patient volume, clinical revenue, and residency training competency requirements. We sought to demonstrate the flexibility of the family medicine workforce as shown through their scopes of practice, and argue that this is indication of their potential for redeployment during emergencies. METHODS This study computes scopes of practice for 78,416 family physicians who treat Medicare beneficiaries. We used Evaluation and Management (E/M) codes in Medicare's 2017 Part-B public use file to calculate volumes of services done across six sites of service per physician. We aggregated counts and proportions of physicians and the E/M services they provided across sites of practice to characterize scope, and performed a separate analysis on rural physicians. RESULTS The study found most family physicians practicing at a single site, namely, the ambulatory clinic. However, family physicians in rural areas, where need is greater, exhibit broader scope. This suggests that a significant number of family physicians have capacity for COVID-19 deployment into other settings, such as emergency rooms or hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Family physicians are a potential resource for emergency redeployment, however the current breadth of scope for most family physicians is not aligned with current residency training requirements and raises questions about the future of family medicine scope of practice.","output":"Family Medicine and Emergency Redeployment: Unrealized Potential."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak started early in December 2019 in the Hubei province and its capital Wuhan of the Peoples Republic of China and caused a global pandemic.

The Nuss procedure is a new effective treatment for severe flail chest patients who cannot be weaned from prolonged mechanical ventilation in the last few years. However, the procedure is not suitable when there are multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls. Here, we reported a rare case of severe flail chest in a patient who suffered multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls in a traffic accident. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old patient suffered severe flail chest by a steering wheel in a traffic accident with multiple fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls. In the beginning, the patient was administrated with mechanical ventilation because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for more than 1 week. Then the patient suffered from a severe lung infection and decreased blood oxygen saturation. After a multidiscipline discussion (MDT), three rib fixation plates were first used to rebuild the stability of lateral chest walls, then two Nuss bars were inserted to eliminate paradoxical movement in the anterior chest wall. Finally, the patient recovered smoothly after the combining procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Severe flail chest patients with both the anterior and lateral chest walls after trauma are in a life-threatening situation, and require an appropriate procedure to get out of danger in time. Rib fixation is an effective treatment when the fractured sites are few and the fractured area is small. The Nuss procedure is a new effective method for severe flail chest with multiple fractures in an anterior chest wall, which is also a minimally invasive and short time-consuming procedure. However, it does not suitable for the patient with multiple fractures in lateral chest walls. Combining the use of Nuss procedure and rib fixation can solve severe flail chest with multiple ribs and sternum fractures in both the anterior and lateral chest walls, and the outcome of this procedure is satisfying in the present rare case.","output":"Combining the use of Nuss procedure and rib fixation for severe flail chest: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sejak awal tahun 2020 COVID-19 menjadi masalah kesehatan dunia.

In this article, I explain social control of Guangzhou's African communities as a problem of municipal politics. What underlies the government's heavy handed approach, I argue, are those communities' ties to rurality, which constitute a roadblock in the city's urban upgrade. Using Dengfeng Village, one of the best known African communities in China, as a case study, I show that efforts to upgrade the area by the local state and the real estate industry were frustrated by the community's status as an urban village. Africans, whom Chinese have historically associated with rurality, are seen as contributing to a space that has long been stigmatized as a spatial manifestation of rural people's lack of self-discipline. To better reveal the interconnection between social control and urban politics, I place official action in context of the history of the community's formation and the lived experience.

Objectives: The present study aimed to determine factors associated with non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and no continued breastfeeding in Haryana. Methods: National Family Health Survey-4 data for the state of Haryana was used for analysis. The outcomes were non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no EBF, and no continued breastfeeding. Independent variables were categorized as sociodemographic, maternal, and child level factors. Each category of factors was added step-by-step to the logistic regression model for multivariable analysis. Results: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding was higher among poorer wealth quintiles. Home deliveries (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]-1.27-2.84), cesarean section (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI-1.46-3.40), body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2 (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI-1.13-2.33), and not receiving postnatal check-up (AOR 1.36, 95% CI-1.40-1.78) increases likelihood of delayed initiation of breastfeeding beyond 1 h of birth.

These disordered proteins often play important functional roles in virus replication, such as down-regulating host defense mechanisms. With the widespread availability of next-generation sequencing, the number of new virus genomes with predicted open reading frames is rapidly outpacing our capacity for directly characterizing protein structures through crystallography. Hence, computational methods for structural prediction play an important role. A large number of predictors focus on the problem of classifying residues into ordered and disordered regions, and these methods tend to be validated on a diverse training set of proteins from eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In this study, we investigate whether some predictors outperform others in the context of virus proteins and compared our findings with data from non-viral proteins. We evaluate the prediction accuracy of 21 methods, many of which are only available as web applications, on a curated set of 126 proteins encoded by viruses. Furthermore, we apply a random forest classifier to these predictor outputs. Based on cross-validation experiments, this ensemble approach confers a substantial improvement in accuracy, e.g., a mean 36 per cent gain in Matthews correlation coefficient. Lastly, we apply the random forest predictor to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ORF6, an accessory gene that encodes a short (61 AA) and moderately disordered protein that inhibits the host innate immune response.

However, whether zinc plays a direct antiviral role in viral infections and whether viruses have adopted strategies to modulate zinc homeostasis have not been investigated. Results from clinical trials of zinc supplementation in infections indicate that zinc supplementation may be beneficial in a pathogen- or disease-specific manner, further underscoring the importance of understanding the interaction between zinc homeostasis and virus infections at the molecular level. We investigated the effect of RSV infection on zinc homeostasis and show that RSV infection in lung epithelial cells leads to modulation of zinc homeostasis. The intracellular labile zinc pool increases upon RSV infection in a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent fashion. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of the ubiquitous zinc uptake transporter ZIP1 suggests that labile zinc levels are increased due to the increased uptake by RSV-infected cells as an antiviral response. Adding zinc to culture medium after RSV infection led to significant inhibition of RSV titers, whereas depletion of zinc by a zinc chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) led to an increase in RSV titers. The inhibitory effect of zinc was specific, as other divalent cations had no effect on RSV titers. Both RSV infection and zinc chelation by TPEN led to reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction, whereas addition of zinc blocked ROS induction. These results suggest a molecular link between RSV infection, zinc homeostasis, and oxidative-stress pathways and provide new insights for developing strategies to counter RSV infection.IMPORTANCE Zinc deficiency rates in developing countries range from 20 to 30%, and zinc supplementation trials have been shown to correct clinical manifestations attributed to zinc deficiency, but the outcomes in the case of respiratory infections have been inconsistent. We aimed at understanding the role of zinc homeostasis in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Infection of lung epithelial cell lines or primary small-airway epithelial cells led to an increase in labile zinc pools, which was due to increased uptake of zinc. Zinc supplementation inhibited RSV replication, whereas zinc chelation had an opposing effect, leading to increases in RSV titers. Increases in labile zinc in RSV-infected cells coincided with induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both zinc depletion and addition of exogenous ROS led to enhanced RSV infection, whereas addition of the antioxidant inhibited RSV, suggesting that zinc is part of an interplay between RSV-induced oxidative stress and the host response to maintain redox balance.","output":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Induced Oxidative Stress Leads to an Increase in Labile Zinc Pools in Lung Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is high prevalence of severe hypoxia, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and high mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonitis. Evidence prior to the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that, compared with conventional ventilation strategies, airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) can improve oxygenation and reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to assess the association between APRV use and clinical outcomes among adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 and hypothesized that APRV use would be associated with improved survival compared with conventional ventilation. Methods: A total of 25 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis was admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for invasive ventilation in Perth, Western Australia, between February and May 2020. Eleven of these patients received APRV. The primary outcome was survival to day 90. Secondary outcomes were ventilation-free survival days to day 90, mechanical complications from ventilation, and number of days ventilated. Results: Patients who received APRV had a lower probability of survival than did those on other forms of ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.89; P=0.036). This finding was independent of indices of severity of illness to predict the use of APRV. Patients who received APRV also had fewer ventilator-free survival days up to 90 days after initiation of ventilation compared to patients who did not receive APRV, and survivors who received APRV had fewer ventilator-free days than survivors who received other forms of ventilation.

Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination.

CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

The disease rapidly spread to the rest of China, to Southern-East Asia, then to Europe, America, and on to the rest of the world. COVID-19 is associated with a betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. The virus penetrates the organism through the respiratory tract, conveyed by contaminated droplets. The main cell receptor targeted is the surface-bound ACE-2. As of the 26th July 2020, 15,200,000 COVID-19 cases and 650,000 deaths were reported worldwide. The mortality rate is estimated between 1.3 and 18.3%. The reproductive rate without any public health intervention is estimated around 4-5.1 in France. Most hospitalized patients for COVID-19 present respiratory symptoms, which in some cases is associated with fever. Up to 86% of admissions to ICU are related to acute respiratory failure. To date, no anti-viral therapy has proven its efficacy considering randomized trials. Only immunomodulatory treatments such as corticosteroids have shown to cause significant improvement in patient outcome.","output":"COVID-19 in clinical practice: A narrative synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A time of change.

Although most patients with COVID-19 develop asymptomatic or mild disease, some patients develop severe disease. The effectiveness of various therapeutic agents, including antiviral drugs, steroids, and anti-inflammatories for COVID-19, have been being confirmed. The effect of administering steroids in early disease is unclear. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and risk of exacerbation of steroids administered preceding antiviral drugs in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center, observational study included consecutive patients with COVID-19 between March 2020 and March 2021. Patients were divided into a steroids-first group and antiviral-drugs-first group. Mortality, duration of hospitalization, incidence rate and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) induction of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 258 patients were admitted during the study period. After excluding patients who received symptomatic treatment only, who were taking immunosuppressive drugs, or who were administered antiviral drugs only, 68 patients were included in the analysis, 16 in the steroids-first group and 52 in the antiviral-drugs-first group. The rate of intubation, ICU admission and ECMO induction were significantly higher in the steroids-first group than in the antiviral-drugs-first group (81.3% vs. 33.3, p<0.001, 75.0% vs. 29.4%, p = 0.001, and 31.3% vs. 7.8%, p = 0.017, respectively). Furthermore, patients who received steroids within ten days after starting antiviral drugs had significantly lower rates of ICU admission, intubation, and ECMO induction. (81.3% vs. 42.9% p = 0.011, 75.0% vs. 37.1% p = 0.012, and 31.3% vs. 8.6% p = 0.039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Administering steroids prior to antiviral drugs soon after symptom onset can aggravate disease severity. When administration of steroids is considered soon after symptom onset, it may be safer to initiate antiviral drugs first.","output":"Possibility of deterioration of respiratory status when steroids precede antiviral drugs in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A remote quality assurance and improvement protocol for point-of-care obstetric ultrasound in low-resource areas was validated against the standard of care for obstetric ultrasound in the United States. METHODS: Compressed movie clip ultrasound images (obstetric sweep protocol) obtained by minimally trained personnel were read and interpreted by physicians with training in obstetric ultrasound. Observed findings were compared among readers and between each reader and the gold standard ultrasound scan report. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. RESULTS: The agreements among readers and between readers and the gold standard, for the anterior and posterior variables of the placental location were excellent, with Cohen &#954; values of 0.81 to 0.88 and 0.77 to 0.9, respectively. Cohen &#954; values were slight or slight/fair for other placental locations (left, right, fundal, and low), and the sensitivity and specificity ranged widely. The agreement among readers and between readers and the gold standard for fetal number comparisons was also excellent, with Cohen &#954; values ranging from 0.82 to 1, sensitivity from 0.83 to 1, and specificity from 0.99 to 1. The agreement among readers for fetal presentation comparisons, according to the Cohen &#954;, ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 and between readers and the gold standard had values of 0.43 to 0.49. For biometric parameters and estimated gestational age calculations based on these parameters, inter-reader reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 for all parameters except femur length.

MethodsThis was a single-center prospective study involving 29 patients (11 females, 18 males;median age 64 years, range: 43-85) with thyrotoxicosis diagnosed after hospitalization for COVID-19 and then followed-up for a median period of 90 days (range: 30-120) after hospital discharge. At the follow-up, patients were evaluated for serum thyrotropic (TSH), free-thyroxine (FT4), free-triiodiothyronine (FT3), TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and ultrasonographic thyroid structure.ResultsAfter recovery of COVID-19, serum TSH values significantly increased ( P <0.001) and FT4 values significantly decreased ( P =0.001), without significant change in serum FT3 ( P =0.572). At the follow-up, 28 subjects (96.6%) became euthyroid whereas overt hypothyroidism developed in one case. At the ultrasound evaluation of thyroid gland, hypoecogenicity was found in 10 patients (34.5%) with a prevalence that was significantly higher in cases with serum TSH > 3.0 mU/l as compared to those with TSH values below 1.0 mU/L ( P =0.039).

OBJECTIVE: To promote safety, and effective clinical practice to voice assessment and rehabilitation in the pandemic COVID-19 context for speech-language pathologists. METHODS: A group of 11 experts in voice and swallowing disorders from five different countries conducted a consensus recommendation following the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery rules building a clinical guide for speech-language pathologists during this pandemic context. RESULTS: The clinical guide provides 65 recommendations for clinicians in the management of voice disorders during the pandemic and includes advice from assessment, direct treatment, telepractice, and teamwork. The consensus was reached 95% for all topics.

In order to ensure efficient denitrification, dosage of the external carbon source is commonly undertaken. However, application of commercial products, such us ethanol or acetate, greatly increases operational costs. As such, inexpensive and efficient alternative carbon sources are strongly desirable. In this study, the use of the fusel oil, a by-product from the distillery industry, was validated in terms of the denitrification process enhancement and impact on the activated sludge bacterial community structure. The experiment was conducted at a full scale biological nutrient removal facility (210,000 PE), in the set of the two technological lines: the experimental line (where fusel oil was introduced at 45 cm3/m3 dose) and the reference line (without an external carbon source addition). During the experimental period of 98 days, conventional nitrate utilization rate (NUR) measurements were carried out on a regular basis in order to assess the biomass adaptation to the fusel oil addition and denitrification process enhancement. While the NURs remained at a stable level in the reference line (1.4  0.1 mg NO3-N/g VSSh) throughout the entire duration of the experiment, the addition of fusel oil gradually enhanced the denitrification process rate up to 2.7 mg NO3-N/g VSSh. Moreover, fusel oil contributed to the mitigation of the variability of NO3-N concentrations in the effluent from the anoxic zone. The bacterial community structure, characterized by 16S rRNA PCRDGGE and the clone libraries of the genes involved in the denitrification process (nirS and nirK), was comparable between the reference and the experimental line during the entire experimental period. In both analyzed lines, the most frequent occurrence of denitrifiers belonging to the genera Acidovorax, Alcaligenes, Azoarcus, Paracoccus and Thauera was noticed. Our results proved that fusel oil would a valuable substrate for denitrification. The addition of fusel oil enhances the process rate and does not reflect a severe selection pressure on the bacterial community at applicable doses. Practical application of fusel oil generates opportunities for the WWTPs to meet effluent standards and reduce operational costs, as well as optimizing waste management for the distillery industry.","output":"Denitrification Process Enhancement and Diversity of the Denitrifying Community in the Full Scale Activated Sludge System after Adaptation to Fusel Oil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Evaluate longitudinal changes in brain microstructure and volumes in very preterm infants during the first year of life with and without intervention.Design: Descriptive pilot study.Methods: Five preterm infants in a three-arm clinical trial, one SPEEDI Early, two SPEEDI Late, and two usual care.

However, it is not uncommon to observe negligence in adopting such behaviour, and this especially among young segments of the population. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) as conceptual framework, this study explores the role of socio-cognitive factors that affect the decision of wearing a pollution mask in the context of young educated people. This is done by selecting a sample of college students in urban China, a country that has seen air quality as one of the major challenges in the last decades. While young urban college students might be expected to be receptive to standard attempts to be influenced through reason-based cognitive stimuli, it is often found that this is not the case. The empirical analysis was articulated it in two steps. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was first used to examine the relationships among the conceptual constructs derived from the TPB conceptual model, and second Step-Wise Ordinary Least Squares Regressions (SWOLS) were employed to observe the partial effect played by each item on the decision to wear a mask. RESULTS: Results show that, while reason-based stimuli play a role, attitude, social norm, and self-efficacy were the most important predictors of the behavioural intention (p < 0.01). The role of past behaviour was also acknowledged as strongly associated with the dependent variable (p < 0.01). Overall, the likelihood of wearing a pollution mask increases with the importance of others socio-cognitive and psychological factors, which could help understand behavioural biases, and explain the relative role of several mechanisms behind the decision to wear a mask. CONCLUSIONS: While tackling pollution requires multiple and synergic approaches, encouraging self-prevention using pollution mask is a simple and effective action, implementable at negligible costs. Resistance among younger, well-educated cohorts to wear masks can be overcome by stressing the social desirability of action and the sense of empowerment derived from its usage. This study has the potential to inform policies aimed at changing suboptimal behavioural attitudes by identifying triggers for change, and it could serve in improving the tailoring of health promotion messages aimed at nudging healthy behaviour.

We investigated whether piloting a CBT-I programme within a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) improves insomnia symptoms. Our programme consisted mainly of Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) determined by individual chronotypes. CBT-I is currently under-resourced in the UK. To our knowledge, this was the first NHS programme in Bristol secondary mental health.Methods10 participants were recruited. Participants underwent a therapist guided initiation on (a) Sleep education (b) Sleep hygiene (c) Stimulus Control. Individual sleep windows were determined by the participants chronotype: whether they were a morning lark or evening owl. Participants then underwent a 6-week course of Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT). Weekly follow up focussed around motivation and explanation was either by phone or face-to-face due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome measurements used pre- and post-intervention sleep diaries;as well as insomnia, depression (PHQ-9) and general health questionnaires (SF-36).ResultsThere was little improvement in Total Sleep Time (TST) (d= -0.84 hours) and patient-reported sleep quality (d= -0.67) following a 6-week course of modified CBT-I. Despite this, average number of mid-sleep awakenings roughly halved (47.9%). ISI, PHQ-9 and SF-36 questionnaires demonstrated no difference between pre-intervention and post-intervention scores. Unstructured interviews revealed that patients thoughts and anxieties at night-time interfered with SRT.ConclusionsOur study suggests that modified CBT-I is a challenge for mental health populations. Solely SRT may not be sufficient to treat insomnia secondary to mental illness. Treating co-morbid insomnia may therefore require multi-component CBT-I to address sleep-related mental health issues, such as panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares.

We aimed to develop and evaluate a novel video education approach to empower patients to proceed with the transplant evaluation and listing process and to increase their knowledge and motivation. MATERIAL/METHODS: We developed 2 theory-informed educational animations about the kidney transplantation evaluation and listing process with input from experts in transplantation and communication, 20 candidates/recipients, 5 caregivers, 1 anthropologist, 3 community advocates, and 36 dialysis or transplant providers. We then conducted an online pre-post study with 28 kidney transplantation candidates to measure the acceptability and feasibility of the 2 videos to improve patients evaluation and listing knowledge, understanding, and concerns. RESULTS: Compared with before intervention, the mean knowledge score increased after intervention by 38% (5.7 to 7.9; P<0.001). Increases in knowledge effect size were large across age group, health literacy, education, technology access, and duration of pretransplant dialysis. The proportion of positive responses increased from before to after animation viewing for understanding the evaluation process (25% to 61%; P=0.002) and waitlist placement (32% to 86%; P<0.001).

This study investigated the decline in anorectal function using sequential anorectal manometric measurements obtained before and after the multimodal treatment as well as at a 1-year follow-up. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a single center. The study population consisted of patients with locally advanced mid- to low rectal cancer who received the preoperative CRT followed by sphincter-preserving surgery from 2012 to 2016. The anorectal manometric value measured after each treatment modality was compared to demonstrate the degree of decline in anorectal function. A generalized linear model of repeated measures was performed using the manometric values measured pre- and post-CRT, and at 12 months postoperatively. Results Overall, 100 patients with 3 consecutive manometric data were included in the final analysis. In the overall cohort study, the mean resting and maximal squeezing pressures showed insignificant decrement post-neoadjuvant CRT. At a 1-year postoperative follow-up, the maximal squeezing pressure significantly decreased. The maximal rectal sensory threshold demonstrated significant reduction consecutively after each following treatment (P<0.001).

The remarkable spread and unpredictable disease outcomes continue to challenge management of this infection. Among the hypotheses to explain the heterogeneity of symptoms is the possibility that exposure to other coronaviruses (CoVs), or overall higher capability to develop immunity against respiratory pathogens, may influence the evolution of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we profiled the immune response across multiple coronavirus receptor binding domains (RBDs), respiratory viruses, and SARS-CoV-2, to determine whether heterologous immunity to other CoV-RBDs or other infections influenced the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response. Overall changes in subclass, isotype, and Fc-receptor binding were profiled broadly across a cohort of 43 individuals against different coronavirusesRBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and the more common HKU1 and NL63 viruses. We found rapid functional evolution of responses to SARS-CoV-2 over time, along with broad but relatively more time-invariant responses to the more common CoVs. Moreover, there was little evidence of correlation between SARS-CoV-2 responses and HKU1, NL63, and respiratory infection (influenza and respiratory syncytial virus) responses. These findings suggest that common viral infections including common CoV immunity, targeting the receptor binding domain involved in viral infection, do not appear to influence the rapid functional evolution of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and thus should not impact diagnostics or shape vaccine-induced immunity. IMPORTANCE A critical step to ending the spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the ability to detect, diagnose, and understand why some individuals develop mild and others develop severe disease. For example, defining the early evolutionary patterns of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and whether prevalent coronaviruses or other common infections influence the evolution of immunity, remains poorly understood but could inform diagnostic and vaccine development. Here, we deeply profiled the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and how it is influenced by other coinfections. Our data suggest an early and rapid rise in functional humoral immunity in the first 2 weeks of infection across antigen-specific targets, which is negligibly influenced by cross-reactivity to additional common coronaviruses or common respiratory infections. These data suggest that preexisting receptor binding domain-specific immunity does not influence or bias the evolution of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and should have negligible influence on shaping diagnostic or vaccine-induced immunity.","output":"Evolution of Early SARS-CoV-2 and Cross-Coronavirus Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of evaporation on droplet sedimentation times is crucial for estimating the risk of infection from virus-containing airborne droplets.

Genetic defects in type I interferon signaling were reported in a significant proportion of critically ill CoOVID-19 patients. Extensive studies on interferon-induced intracellular signal transduction pathways led to the elucidation of the Jak-Stat pathway. Furthermore, advances in gene expression profiling by microarrays have revealed that type I interferon rapidly induced multiple transcription factor mRNA levels. In this study, transcription factor profiling in the transcriptome was used to gain novel insights into the role of inducible transcription factors in response to type I interferon signaling in immune cells and in lung epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Modeling the interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA data in terms of distinct sub-networks based on biological functions such as antiviral response, immune modulation, and cell growth revealed enrichment of specific transcription factors in mouse and human immune cells. The evolutionarily conserved core type I interferon gene expression consists of the inducible transcriptional factor mRNA of the antiviral response sub-network and enriched in granulocytes. Analysis of the type I interferon-inducible transcription factor sub-networks as distinct protein-protein interaction pathways revealed insights into the role of critical hubs in signaling. Interrogation of multiple microarray datasets revealed that SARS-CoV-2 induced high levels of IFN-beta and interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA in human lung epithelial cells. Transcription factor mRNA of the three major sub-networks regulating antiviral, immune modulation, and cell growth were differentially regulated in human lung epithelial cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the tissue samples of COVID-19 patients.

Research has shown that women experiencing homelessness are often hidden (i.e. provisionally housed) and have different pathways into homelessness and different needs as compared to men. The objective of this research is to identify evidence-based interventions and best practices to better support women experiencing or at risk of homelessness. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review with a gender and equity analysis. This involved searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and other databases for systematic reviews and randomized trials, supplementing our search through reference scanning and grey literature, followed by a qualitative synthesis of the evidence that examined gender and equity considerations. RESULTS: Of the 4102 articles identified on homelessness interventions, only 4 systematic reviews and 9 randomized trials were exclusively conducted on women or published disaggregated data enabling a gender analysis. Interventions with the strongest evidence included post-shelter advocacy counselling for women experiencing homelessness due to intimate partner violence, as well as case management and permanent housing subsidies (e.g. tenant-based rental assistance vouchers), which were shown to reduce homelessness, food insecurity, exposure to violence and psychosocial distress, as well as promote school stability and child well-being. CONCLUSION: Much of the evidence on interventions to better support women experiencing homelessness focusses on those accessing domestic violence or family shelters.

Pooling nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs seems to be a promising strategy, saving time and resources, but it could reduce the sensitivity of the RT-PCR and exacerbate samples management in terms of automation and tracing. In this study, taking advantage of the routine implementation of a screening plan on health workers, we evaluated the feasibility of pool testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis in the presence of low viral load samples. METHOD Pools were prepared with an automated instrument, mixing 4, 6 or 20 NP specimens, including one, two or none positive samples. Ct values of positive samples were on average about 35 for the four genes analyzed. RESULTS The overall sensitivity of 4-samples and 6-samples pools was 93.1 and 90.0%, respectively. Focussing on pools including one sample with Ct value 35 for all analyzed genes, sensitivity decreased to 77.8 and 75.0% for 4- and 6-samples, respectively; pools including two positive samples, resulted positive in any size as well as pools including positive samples with Ct values <35.

To date, the main application of the DEL platform has been the identification of reversible ligands using multiple rounds of affinity selection. Irreversible (covalent) inhibition offers a unique mechanism of action for drug discovery research. In this study, we report a developing method of identifying irreversible (covalent) ligands from DELs. The new method was validated by using 3C protease (3CP) and on-DNA irreversible tool compounds (rupintrivir derivatives) spiked into a library at the same concentration as individual members of that library. After affinity selections against 3CP, the irreversible tool compounds were specifically enriched compared with the library members. In addition, we compared two immobilization methods and concluded that microscale columns packed with the appropriate affinity resin gave higher tool compound recovery than magnetic beads.","output":"Development of a Selection Method for Discovering Irreversible (Covalent) Binders from a DNA-Encoded Library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Observations on infectious diseases often consist of a sample of cases, distinguished by symptoms, and other characteristics, such as onset dates, spatial locations, genetic sequence of the pathogen and/or physiological and clinical data. Cases are often clustered, in space and time, suggesting that they are connected. By defining kernel functions for pairwise analysis of cases, a matrix of transmission probabilities can be estimated. We set up a Bayesian framework to integrate various sources of information to estimate the transmission network. The method is illustrated by analysing data from a multi-year study (2002-2007) of nosocomial outbreaks of norovirus in a large university hospital in the Netherlands. The study included 264 cases, the norovirus genotype was known in approximately 60 per cent of the patients. Combining all the available data allowed likely identification of individual transmission links between most of the cases (72%). This illustrates that the proposed method can be used to accurately reconstruct transmission networks, enhancing our understanding of outbreak dynamics and possibly leading to new insights into how to prevent outbreaks.","output":"Infectious disease transmission as a forensic problem: who infected whom?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article critically examines some of the measures installed to fight the Covid\\\\19 pandemic, such as the face mask, and the responses these have called forth It relies on clinical material and on popular culture The purpose is twofold First, to exemplify the unique contribution of psychoanalysis for decoding both the political narrative and its reception thus helping understand and better address societal challenges Second, to inform the debate in the political sciences as to what is a good crisis management strategy The main argument is that an effective communication, in general, but especially in emergency situations, needs to allow for the unconscious responses to both the danger itself and to the measures imposed to deal with it Failure to consider this unconscious dimension impacts on the effectiveness of the policy [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Not a political statement: Psychoanalytic notes on the measures to fight the pandemic and the responses to them"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to find out: 1) what is the role of parents on student learning outcomes? 2) What is the role of parents in online learning? 3) What are the efforts made by parents in improving student learning outcomes in online learning?

Despite all attempts that have been made to combat the pandemic, the re-emergence of new variants complicated SARS-CoV-2 eradication. The ongoing global spread of COVID-19 demands the incessant development of novel agents in vaccination, diagnosis, and therapeutics. Targeting receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein by which the virus identifies host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), is a promising strategy for curbing viral infection. This study aims to discover novel peptide inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 entry using computational approaches. The RBD binding domain of ACE2 was extracted and docked against the RBD. MMPBSA calculations revealed the binding energies of each residue in the template. The residues with unfavorable binding energies were considered as mutation spots by OSPREY. Binding energies of the residues in RBD-ACE2 interface was determined by molecular docking. Peptide inhibitors were designed by the mutation of RBD residues in the virus-receptors complex which had unfavorable energies. Peptide tendency for RBD binding, safety, and allergenicity were the criteria based on which the final hits were screened among the initial library. Molecular dynamics simulations also provided information on the mechanisms of inhibitory action in peptides. The results were finally validated by molecular docking simulations to make sure the peptides are capable of hindering virus-host interaction. Our results introduce three peptides P7 (RAWTFLDKFNHEAEDLRYQSSLASWN), P13 (RASTFLDKFNHEAEDLRYQSSLASWN), and P19 (RADTFLDKFNHEAEDLRYQSSLASWN) as potential effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry which could be considered in drug development for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by potent peptides designed by the mutation of ACE2 binding region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, since its initial outbreak in Wuhan, China has led to a worldwide pandemic and has shut down nations.

For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results. RESULTS: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean yest=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, Sest=0.007; standard error of the observation, &#963;x=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (yest=0.39; y=0.28; Sest=0.007; &#963;x=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (yest=0.25; y=0.23; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (yest=0.25; y=0.21; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers.

The majority of CD4+ T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected CNS in the course of the infection are primed cells that neither proliferate ex vivo nor can be stimulated to proliferation by viral antigens or mitogen in vitro. In contrast, T lymphocytes taken from CLNs of the same animals revealed a strong proliferative response. Restimulation of CLN lymphocytes by viral antigens disclosed a striking difference between the disease-resistant rat strain Brown Norway (BN) and the susceptible Lewis (LEW) strain. Whereas BN lymphocytes responded as early as 5 days post infection, it took more than 11 days until a comparable proliferation was detectable in LEW lymphocytes. From these data we postulate that the majority of T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected brain after sensitisation and expansion in cervical lymph nodes is unresponsive to further proliferation signals and that the kinetics and magnitude of T lymphocyte stimulation in CLNs play an important role in the clinical course of the infection.","output":"Cervical lymphoid tissue but not the central nervous system supports proliferation of virus-specific T lymphocytes during coronavirus-induced encephalitis in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic and a serious respiratory disorder that is caused by coronavirus.

It is motivated by the desire to reduce passengers' likelihood of passing close to seated passengers when they take their seats. However, our prior work on the risk of Ebola spread in airplanes suggested that the driving force for increased exposure to infection transmission risk is the clustering of passengers while waiting for others to stow their luggage and take their seats. In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated.

Of all the mental health conditions, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of global health-related burden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many uncertain factors affecting mental health accumulated, such as virus transmission, blockade and ban, public transport restrictions, closure of schools and enterprises, and reduction of social interaction, which led to an increase in the potential risk of MDD, further increasing the global health-related burden. Methodology To better clarify the public interest in major depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, a Google Trends analysis was employed with data from December 2019 to December 2021, taking the cumulative diagnosis rate and cumulative mortality rate of COVID-19 as the reference standard, The changes in public interest and behavior in online searching for major depressive disorder in the three countries most affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus (i.e. the United States, Brazil, and India) were evaluated. Results We observed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, public interest in major depressive disorder increased significantly on the Internet. At the same time, compared with the United States, this upward trend is more prominent in India and Brazil. The study found that the major depressive disorder search index of the United States reached the maximum at the end of September 2021, the major depressive disorder search index of Brazil reached the maximum at the beginning of July 2021, and the major depressive disorder search index of India reached the maximum at the beginning of June 2021. The above time nodes are the first turning point of decline after the continuous surge of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the United States, Brazil, and India, indicating that there is an important time correlation between the surge of COVID-19 cases and the public online search term major depressive disorder. Conclusion The Google Trends analysis shows that public interest in major depressive disorder is on the rise under the COVID-19 pandemic and that COVID-19 may be associated with MDD. These findings deserve further exploration, especially as a growing body of research reports suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the prevalence of MDD.

Because remaining controversial, the objective was to determine prospectively the respective role of RSV, RV, hMPV and co-infections on the severity of acute bronchiolitis in very young infants. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 209 infants (median age: 2.4 months) were enrolled in a prospective study of infants <1 year old, hospitalized for a first episode of bronchiolitis during the winter epidemic season and with no high risk for severe disease. The severity was assessed by recording SaO(2)% at admission, a daily clinical score (scale 0C18), the duration of oxygen supplementation and the length of hospitalization. Viruses were identified in 94.7% by RT amplification reaction: RSV only (45.8%), RV only (7.2%), hMPV only (3.8%), dual RSV/RV (14.3%), and other virus only (2%) or coinfections (9%). RV compared respectively with RSV and dual RSV/RV infection caused a significant less severe disease with a lower clinical score (5[3.2C6] vs. 6[4C8], p = 0.01 and 5.5[5C7], p = 0.04), a shorter time in oxygen supplementation (0[0C1] days vs. 2[0C3] days, p = 0.02 and 2[0C3] days, p = 0.03) and a shorter hospital stay (3[3C4.7] days vs.6 [5C8] days, p = 0.001 and 5[4C6] days, p = 0.04). Conversely, RSV infants had also longer duration of hospitalization in comparison with RSV/RV (p = 0.01) and hMPV (p = 0.04). The multivariate analyses showed that the type of virus carried was independently associated with the duration of hospitalization.

It has been a test for economic resilience, and how this crisis will affect business activities will be determined by their competitiveness. Only firms that have succeeded in reorienting and quickly adapting to the emerging crisis have continued without interruption in their operations, thus demonstrating their flexibility and high level of resilience. Research shows that companies driving the gig economy celebrate the benefits: flexibility, additional income, freedom and other various opportunities for workers. They require entrepreneurial digital skills that improve their competitiveness and benefit not only themselves but the economy as well. Therefore, digital competencies are becoming a significant resource and precondition for employment, and it is essential to promote digital entrepreneurial skills, introducing them into education programs through different forms of education. This book stresses and explores the importance of synergy between industry and virtual universities. Considering the importance of these issues, this book draws together literature on globalization and small and medium enterprise development and internationalization from disparate sources into a cohesive body of work, which traces the evolution of entrepreneurship and our understanding of the topic. It investigates the impact of digitalization on creating job opportunities in the labor market. Covering social, economic and psychological approaches to the most current topics, this book will be a useful framework to new theories and practices that are emerging to challenge conventional wisdom.

BACKGROUND Both ANL and healthy work environment (HWE) contribute to staff and patient outcomes. Our 1st study of these 2 variables revealed a positive relationship. Will this be upheld in a pandemic year? METHODS More than 5000 nurses from a national sample participated in a cross-sectional, correlational, descriptive study using the Authentic Nurse Leadership Questionnaire, the Critical Elements of a Healthy Work Environment Scale, and a pandemic impact on practice question. RESULTS Overall, nurses perceived ANL and HWE were present despite a high level of pandemic impact; however, when clinical nurses were separated from managers/directors, HWE was not present for frontline nurses. The moderate correlation of ANL and HWE was replicated in this larger study. CONCLUSIONS This is the 2nd study of the positive relationship between ANL and HWE using these models, supporting ANL as an essential standard of a HWE. ANL was present for clinical nurses in a pandemic year signaling that nurse leaders rose to meet frontline leadership needs. HWE was present overall, but not for clinical nurses.

Most transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 occur in households. MethodsUsing individual-level registry data of all Norwegian residents we compared infections across all multi-person households. A household with at least one member born abroad was defined as an immigrant household. For the subset of households where at least one person tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from August 1st 2020 to May 1st 2021, we calculated secondary attack rates (SARs) as the percent of other household members testing positive within 14 days after the first household member tested positive. Logistic regression model was used to adjust for sex, age, household composition and geography. ResultsAmong all multi-person households in Norway (n=1 421 642), immigrant households (n=341 604) comprised more members on average (3.2) than households with only Norwegian-born members (2.8). The share of immigrant households where at least one member had been tested, was 56% (vs 49% in the households with only Norwegian-born members), and the share where at least one member was infected was 3.7% (vs 1.4% in households with only Norwegian-born members). Secondary attack rates were higher in immigrant (32%) than Norwegian-born households (20%). Results differed considerably by country of birth, with secondary attack rates particularly high in households from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Pakistan, also after adjustment for sex, age, household composition and geography. ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 is more frequently introduced into multi-person immigrant households than into households with only Norwegian-born members, and transmission within the household occurs more frequently in immigrant households. The results are likely related to living conditions, family composition or differences in social interaction, emphasizing the need to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into these vulnerable households.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 into and within immigrant households.

Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), have demonstrated a strong safety profile and possible efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but whether these therapies are effective for treating respiratory virus-induced ARDS is unknown. According to the WHO ICTRP and the NIH clinicaltrials.gov databases, 27 clinical investigations of MSC-based cell therapy approaches have begun in China since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as a growing number of academic and industry trials elsewhere. Several recent published reports have suggested potential efficacy; however, the available data presented is either anecdotal or from incomplete, poorly controlled investigations. Therefore, while there may be a potential role for MSCs and other cell-based therapies in treatment of COVID-19, these need to be investigated in a rationally designed, controlled approach if safety and efficacy are to be demonstrated accurately.

At recruitment, median age was 68.5 years (IQR, 62.5 to 73.6) and FEV1 as percentage of predicted (FEV1%Pred) was 38.5% (IQR, 27.7 to 50.3). Results During the study, the patients experienced 1,389 exacerbations, a median of 2.52/yr (IQR, 1.48 to 3.96) and FEV1 declined by 40.2 mL/yr or as FEV1%Pred by 1.5%/yr. Concerning inflammatory markers, sputum interleukin (IL)-6 rose by 9 pg/mL/yr, sputum neutrophil count rose by 1.64  106 cells per gram sputum per year, an plasma fibrinogen rose by 0.10 g/L/yr (all p < 0.05).

Given the logistical challenges of psychophysical testing, understanding the longitudinal relationship between self-reported and quantitative measures can help accurately identify patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction. This study aimed to longitudinally correlate measured and subjective olfactory function in COVID-19 subjects. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating subjective and measured olfaction was conducted on ambulatory COVID-19 subjects. Olfaction scores were obtained using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = anosmia, 10 = normosmia) and the validated 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Weekly testing was performed until recovery (BSIT &#8805; 9/12 and/or VAS = 10/10) or study completion. RESULTS: Eighty-six polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 subjects were recruited &#8804;3 days from diagnosis and 52 completed longitudinal testing. Among those with self-reported smell loss at recruitment, similar levels (75.8%) of objective (BSIT &#8805; 9/12) and subjective recovery were obtained using a VAS cutoff &#8805;8, yet only 30.3% reported complete subjective recovery (VAS = 10). Median times to objective and complete subjective olfactory recovery were 12  2.3 and 24  3.5 days, respectively. Although both measures showed chemosensory improvement, the distributions of objective and full subjective olfactory recovery differed significantly (log rank test &#967;2 = 6.46, degrees of freedom [df] = 1, p = 0.011). Overall correlation between BSIT and VAS scores was moderate to strong across longitudinal follow-up (rs = 0.41-0.65). CONCLUSION: Self-reported and psychophysically measured COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction improve at similar levels and are moderately correlated longitudinally, yet there is a significant delay in complete subjective recovery.

METHODS: Prospective observational case series study in patients requiring corneal graft manage toward separate free and restricted pathways for those COVID-19 negative or positive, respectively. RESULTS: During the national lockdown, 30 consecutive patients underwent endothelial (n = 16), penetrating (n = 9), and anterior lamellar keratoplasty (n = 5). Two patients followed the COVID-19 restricted pathway, as they were considered positive while waiting for test results. Nine patients were hospitalized one night in the hospital. On admission to the hospital before surgery, at surgery, the day after surgery and at 7 and 30 days all patients and health-care personnel showed no symptoms and resulted negative at risks factors/exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and occurrence of COVID-19.

The present study proposed and established a detailed induction and assessment protocol for a unique and cost-effective preclinical steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) in rats with pulsed injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS). METHODS: Sixteen 24-week-old male SpragueCDawley rats were used to induce SAON by one intravenous injection of LPS (0.2 mg/kg) and three intraperitoneal injections of MPS (100 mg/kg) with a time interval of 24 hour, and then, MPS (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected three times a week from week 2 until sacrifice. Additional 12 rats were used as normal controls. Two and six weeks after induction, animals were scanned by metabolic dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for evaluation of tissue composition; serum was collected for bone turnover markers, Microfil perfusion was performed for angiography, the liver was collected for histopathology and bilateral femora and bilateral tibiae were collected for histological examination. RESULTS: Three rats died after LPS injection, i.e., with 15.8% (3/19) mortality. Histological evaluation showed 100% incidence of SAON at week 2. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed significantly higher fat percent and lower lean mass in SAON group at week 6. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) showed significant bone degradation at proximal tibia 6 weeks after SAON induction. Angiography illustrated significantly less blood vessels in the proximal tibia and significantly more leakage particles in the distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. Serum amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin were significantly lower at both 2 and 6 weeks after SAON induction, and serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide was significantly lower at 6 weeks after SAON induction. Histomorphometry revealed significantly lower osteoblast surface and higher marrow fat fraction and oedema area in SAON group. Hepatic oedema appeared 2 weeks after SAON induction, and lipid accumulation appeared in the liver of SAON rats 6 weeks after SAON induction. CONCLUSION: The present study successfully induced SAON in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS, which was well simulating the clinical feature and pathology. Apart from available large animal models, such as bipedal emus or quadrupedal rabbits, our current SAON small model in rats could be a cost-effective preclinical experimental model to study body metabolism, molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention or treatment of SAON. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: The present study successfully induced SAON in a small animal model in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS. The evaluation protocols with typical histopathologic ON features and advanced evaluation approaches to identify the metabolic disorders of SAON could be used in future rat SAON studies. The SAON rat model is a suitable and cost-effective animal model to study molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention and treatment of SAON.","output":"Steroid-associated osteonecrosis animal model in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Some commercial/industrial sectors have increased their interest in sustainability, in some cases changing their business focus, from a profit-centered approach to a more balanced view, including environmental and social factors. It means that the interest in sustainability is increasing. Life cycle management (LCM) is a methodology/concept that can contribute to this paradigm shift. In this research, the potential application of LCM in the bakery segment was investigated, considering the entire value chain related to the sector (inputs, packaging, suppliers, customers, waste management). METHODS: Bakeries were visited, in Teresina, Piau, Brazil, to learn about the products, services, production processes, and the socio-environmental and economic sustainability practices, aiming at identifying bottlenecks and to propose alternatives based on LCM. Besides the field approach, the study was structured based on the literature that brings the concepts and potentialities of applying LCM in various economic/industrial sectors. The PDCA cycle and the SWOT Matrix were also used to assist the implementation of LCM. A roadmap was proposed aiming at the LCM implementation in bakeries. RESULTS: The results show that although the sector has some environmentally sustainable practices (waste separation, energy savings, reuse of products, inputs purchased locally), the primary intention is to reduce costs and not to mitigate environmental impacts. Regarding social responsibility, they donate bread to institutions. This is an important attitude, but not the only one for fulfilling the social role within the value chain. They do not consider suppliers that show concern for the environment (certified companies), and both marketing and product labels do not evoke these issues too. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Thus, there is the possibility of implementing LCM in bakeries if there is a concern with sustainable production and consumption. A roadmap for implementing LCM in bakeries was proposed including some steps: mapping the life cycle of products/processes/services associated with the sector; analyzing factors that can influence the actions towards sustainability; disseminating life cycle information to the entire value chain; efficient waste management, including the partnership with recycling companies; and treatment of the collected data and improvement proposal, using management tools such as the PDCA Cycle, the SWOT Matrix, and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aiming at the search for environmental and economic sustainability and social fair alternatives.

The questionnaires included the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-53) to measure mental health indicators, the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help ScaleCShort Form, and the Coronavirus Awareness Scale-10 (CAS-10). An Exploratory Factor Analysis suggests that three factors underlie the CAS-10: Coronavirus Concern, Exaggerated Perception, and Immunity Perception. Results indicate a significant positive correlation between Coronavirus Concern and both general anxiety and phobic anxiety symptoms. Immunity Perception is positively related to paranoid ideation and psychotic symptoms. A Mediation Analysis determined that Coronavirus Concern has a significant positive direct effect on Openness to Seeking Psychological Treatment (OSPT), while Exaggerated Perception and Immunity Perception scores have significant direct negative effects on the Value and Need in Seeking Treatment (VNST) scores. Indirectly, the relationship between Coronavirus Concern and OPST is significantly mediated by anxiety symptoms. Similar results were found for the VNST subscale.

Whole-grain intake increased by 64% (p = 0.085), vegetable intake increased by 58% (p = < 0.001), fruit intake increased by 39% (p = < 0.001), physical activity increased by 14% (p = < 0.001), and red meat consumption decreased by 19% (p = < 0.001). The median HLS increased from 7 to 8 (p = < 0.001). At baseline the association between ideal health behaviors and the SCES was significant for fruit intake (r = 0.22, p-value = 0.003) and red meat consumption (r = 0.17, p-value = 0.02). The aggregate behaviors as represented by the HLS were associated with the SCES (r = 0.19, p-value = 0.03). The significant increase in the HLS indicates an average improvement in the degree to which participants were meeting recommendations after completing the program. Therefore, adherence to these ideal health behaviors increased over the 10-week program.","output":"Developing Faith-Based Health Promotion Programs that Target Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer Risk Factors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the frontline of the pandemic stand healthcare workers and public service providers, occupations which have proven to be associated with increased mental health problems during pandemic crises.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression were assessed by the Norwegian version of the PTSD checklist (PCL-5), General Anxiety Disorder -7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Health anxiety and specific predictors were assessed with specific items. Multiple regression analysis was used for predictor analysis. A total of 28.9% of the sample had clinical or subclinical symptoms of PTSD, and 21.2% and 20.5% were above the established cut-offs for anxiety and depression. Those working directly in contrast to indirectly with COVID-19 patients had significantly higher PTSD symptoms. Worries about job and economy, negative metacognitions, burnout, health anxiety and emotional support were significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, after controlling for demographic variables and psychological symptoms. Health workers and public service providers are experiencing high levels of PTSD symptoms, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health workers working directly with COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms and depression compared to those working indirectly.

A proposed strategy for evading immunity during persistent PRRSV infection is by preventing the induction of IFN activity in pigs and/or by blocking the activation of antiviral proteins in permissive cells. IFN- mRNA expression was observed in the lymph nodes and lungs of pigs infected with wild-type PRRSV strain SDSU-23983. Pretreatment of MARC-145 cells with IFN- inhibited wild-type (SDSU-23983 P6) and culture-adapted (SDSU-23983 P136) PRRS viruses in a dose-dependent manner and at relatively low concentrations. The effect of IFN- on virus replication included reductions in the number of infected cells, virus yield, and RNA content in single cells. Virus replication was partially restored by the addition of 2-aminopurine (2-AP), an inhibitor of dsRNA inducible protein kinase (PKR). The addition of 2-AP also restored the viral RNA content per cell to near normal levels, suggesting that inhibition of viral RNA synthesis was through PKR. The principal difference between P6 and P136 isolates was the recovery of P136 replication with lower concentrations of 2-AP. Immunostaining with anti-PKR antibody showed a redistribution of PKR from the cytoplasm into nucleoli of infected cells.","output":"Inhibition of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by interferon-gamma and recovery of virus replication with 2-aminopurine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Grandparents who have grandchildren with disabilities are an underrepresented group in existing research related to the field.

Using a literature review, we created a self-administered survey encompassing 10 CCM national objectives of training to address: (1) curricular content and evaluation methods, (2) residents' preparedness to meet these objectives, and (3) opportunities for educational improvement. We performed pilot testing and clinical sensibility testing, then distributed it to all residents and PDs across the 13 Canadian CCM programs. Our response rate was 84.3% overall (77 [81.1%] for residents and 13 [100%] for PDs). Residents rated direct observation, informal advice, and self-reflection as both the top 3 most utilized and perceived most effective teaching modalities. Residents most commonly reported comfort with skills related to pain and symptom management (n = 67, 94.3%; score > 3 on 5-point Likert scale), and least commonly reported comfort with donation after cardiac death skills (n = 26-38; 44.8%-65.5%). Base specialty and time in CCM training were independently associated with comfort ratings for some, but not all, EOL skills. With respect to family meetings, residents infrequently received feedback; however, most PDs believed feedback on 6 to 10 meetings is required for competence. When PD perceptions of teaching effectiveness were compared with resident comfort ratings, differences were most apparent for skills related to pain and symptom management, cultural awareness, and ethical principles. By the end of their first subspecialty training year, PDs expect residents to be competent at most, but not all, EOL skills. In summary, trainees and programs rely on clinical activities to develop competency in EOL care, resulting in some educational gaps.

Combined with technological advances in next-generation sequencing, metagenome-based diagnostic tools hold much promise to revolutionize rapid point-of-care diagnosis. However, there are significant challenges in developing such an approach, the chief among which is to learn self-supervised representations that can help detect novel pathogen signatures with very low amounts of labeled data. This is particularly a difficult task given that closely related pathogens can share more than 90% of their genome structure. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing MG-Net, a self-supervised representation learning framework that leverages multi-modal context using pseudo-imaging data derived from clinical metagenome sequences. We show that the proposed framework can learn robust representations from unlabeled data that can be used for downstream tasks such as metagenome sequence classification with limited access to labeled data.

Current clinical studies have interpreted that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, ACE2 is the major component of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE2 deteriorates angiotensin II, a peptide that is responsible for the promotion of stroke. The downregulation of ACE2 further activates an immunological cascade. Thus, researchers need to explore and examine the possible links between COVID-19 and ischemic stroke (IS). Human ACE2 expression level and pattern in various tissues might be decisive for the vulnerability, symptoms, and treatment outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The swift increase in the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 has given creditable evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients also encounter neurological deficits. As the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it will hamper the activity of ACE2 in providing neuroprotection, especially in the case of stroke patients. Due to the downregulation of ACE2, the inflammatory response is activated in the ischemic penumbra. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people with various pre-existing diseases, including IS, in such a way that these patients need special care and attention for their survival. Several clinical trials are currently ongoing worldwide as well as many other projects are in different stages of conceptualization and planning to facilitate the effective management of stroke patients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Cross-Talk Between Key Players in Patients with COVID-19 and Ischemic Stroke: A Review on Neurobiological Insight of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reflecting the level of welfare of the fishers and fish farmers, terms of trade index (namely NTN/NTP) is believed to have decreased as the result of the Covid 19 outbreak.

This article describes the Child Health PSO and proposes PSOs as a new construct for LNs. METHODS: A PSOs ability to affect patient care depends on member organizations integration of PSO output into their individual Learning Healthcare Systems. Therefore, the Child Health PSO developed tenets of an LN to improve member engagement in PSO outputs. RESULTS: All Child Health PSO members participate in case-based learning, requiring ongoing and robust participation by all members. The engagement has been strong, with 86% of childrens hospitals achieving a case learning activity metric and 60% of childrens hospitals submitting cases. From this LNs perspective, 53% of childrens hospitals are considered highly engaged. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 10 years, the Child Health PSO has evolved as a viable LN and, to sustain this, has set a target of 100% of participating childrens hospitals being highly engaged. The previously inconceivable notion of sharing information to improve patient safety among hospitals is now an expected result of the formation of trusting relationships under a federally certified PSO.

As knowledge about COVID-19 rapidly evolves, global implementation of containment and mitigation measures has varied greatly, with impacts to mental wellness. Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health needs of health care workers and other workers may help mitigate mental health impacts and secure sustained delivery of health care and other essential goods and services. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the self-reported prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in health care workers and other workers seeking support through Text4Hope, an evidence-based SMS text messaging service supporting the mental health of residents of Alberta, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey gathered demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, education, relationship, housing and employment status, employment type, and isolation status) and clinical characteristics using validated tools (self-reported stress, anxiety, depression, and contamination/hand hygiene obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis were used to compare the clinical characteristics of health care workers and other workers. Post hoc analysis was conducted on variables with >3 response categories using adjusted residuals. Logistic regression determined associations between worker type and likelihood of self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder, while controlling for other variables. RESULTS: Overall, 8267 surveys were submitted by 44,992 Text4Hope subscribers (19.39%). Of these, 5990 respondents were employed (72.5%), 958 (11.6%) were unemployed, 454 (5.5%) were students, 559 (6.8%) were retired, 234 (2.8%) selected other, and 72 (0.9%) did not indicate their employment status. Most employed survey respondents were female (n=4621, 86.2%). In the general sample, the 6-week prevalence rates for moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were 85.6%, 47.0%, and 44.0%, respectively. Self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression were all statistically significantly higher in other workers than in health care workers (P<.001). Other workers reported higher obsessive-compulsive symptoms (worry about contamination and compulsive handwashing behavior) after the onset of the pandemic (P<.001), while health care worker symptoms were statistically significantly higher before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (P<.001). This finding should be interpreted with caution, as it is unclear the extent to which the adaptive behavior of health care workers or the other workers might be misclassified by validated tools during a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing symptoms of prevalent stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior in health care workers and other workers may enhance our understanding of COVID-19 mental health needs. Research is needed to understand more fully the relationship between worker type, outbreak phase, and mental health changes over time, as well as the utility of validated tools in health care workers and other workers during pandemics. Our findings underscore the importance of anticipating and mitigating the mental health effects of pandemics using integrated implementation strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the ease of safely and rapidly assessing mental health needs using an SMS text messaging platform during a pandemic.

NMDAr hypofunction affects normal oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity in key brain regions related to schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. It has been shown that prior long-term potentiation (LTP) occluded the increase of synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway induced by MK-801, a non-competitive NMDAr antagonist. However, it is not clear whether LTP could also modulate aberrant oscillations and short-term plasticity disruptions induced by NMDAr antagonists. Thus, we tested whether LTP could mitigate the electrophysiological changes promoted by KET. We recorded HPC-PFC local field potentials and evoked responses in urethane anesthetized rats, before and after KET administration, preceded or not by LTP induction. Our results show that KET promotes an aberrant delta-high-gamma cross-frequency coupling in the PFC and an enhancement in HPC-PFC evoked responses. LTP induction prior to KET attenuates changes in synaptic efficiency and prevents the increase in cortical gamma amplitude comodulation. These findings are consistent with evidence that increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors attenuates cognitive impairment in animal models of psychosis. Therefore, high-frequency stimulation in HPC may be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent NMDAr hypofunction effects on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory coordination in cortico-limbic circuits.","output":"Long-term potentiation prevents ketamine-induced aberrant neurophysiological dynamics in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This write-up is a brief reflection of a rural doctor couple, Dr. Himmatrao Saluba Bawaskar (HSB) and Dr. Pramodini Himmatrao Bawaskar (PHB), working in the remote area of Maharashtra state of India during COVID-19 pandemic.

A cohort of 120 health care workers previously affected by COVID-19 was examined 4 months after the diagnosis by means of neurological and extensive cognitive evaluation and compared to a group of 30 health care workers who did not have COVID-19 and were similar for age and co morbidities. At 4 month follow-up, 118/120 COVID-19 cases had normal neurological examination, two patients had neurological deficits. COVID-19 patients did not show general cognitive impairment at MMSE. In COVID-19 cases the number of impaired neuropsychological tests was not significantly different from non COVID-19 cases (mean 1.69 and 1 respectively, MannCWhitney p = n.s.), as well as all the mean tests scores. Anxiety, stress and depression scores resulted to be significantly higher in COVID-19 than in non COVID-19 cases. The results do not support the presence of neurological deficits or cognitive impairment in this selected population of mildCmoderate COVID-19 patients four months after the diagnosis. Severe emotional disorders in patients who had COVID-19 in the past are confirmed.","output":"Neurological and cognitive sequelae of Covid-19: a four month follow-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a new pandemic disease whose pathophysiology and clinical description are still not completely defined.

The CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race represents an opportunity to further develop BCI design strategies for use in real-time applications with a tetraplegic end user. In this study, as part of the preparation to participate in CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race, we investigate the design aspects of BCI in relation to the choice of its components, in particular, the type of calibration paradigm and its relevance for long-term use. The end goal was to develop a user-friendly and engaging interface suited for long-term use, especially for a spinal-cord injured (SCI) patient. We compared the efficacy of conventional open-loop calibration paradigms with real-time closed-loop paradigms, using pre-trained BCI decoders. Various indicators of performance were analyzed for this study, including the resulting classification performance, game completion time, brain activation maps, and also subjective feedback from the pilot. Our results show that the closed-loop calibration paradigms with real-time feedback is more engaging for the pilot. They also show an indication of achieving better online median classification performance as compared to conventional calibration paradigms (p = 0.0008). We also observe that stronger and more localized brain activation patterns are elicited in the closed-loop paradigm in which the experiment interface closely resembled the end application. Thus, based on this longitudinal evaluation of single-subject data, we demonstrate that BCI-based calibration paradigms with active user-engagement, such as with real-time feedback, could help in achieving better user acceptability and performance.","output":"Design Considerations for Long Term Non-invasive Brain Computer Interface Training With Tetraplegic CYBATHLON Pilot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 emergency has urged companies to operate in new ways to face supply chain interruptions, shifts in customer demand, and risks to workforce health.

There is a high frequency of increased BMI in patients admitted to intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a major severity in patients with an excess of visceral adiposity. Patients at risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory syndrome are characterised by the high prevalence of preexisting diseases (high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer), most of them typically present in severely obese patients. Indeed, the biological role of adipose tissue in sustaining SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely elucidated. During pandemics, including the most recent COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of population healthcare is expected to be affected negatively, impacting the lifestyle of population. The pandemic of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has caused significant disruption in everyday lifestyle. Aim of the study: to assess the Impact of COVID-19 virus on the obesity and depression on Population at Saudi Arabia in Makkah Al-Mukarramah. Method: Across-sectional study among Population residents in primary health care center in Makkah Al-Mukarramah was conducted using an online questionnaire designed during April 2021.

This review quantifies the published human NOTES experience to date, examines instrument use in detail, and compiles available perioperative outcomes data. METHODS A PubMed search for all articles describing human NOTES cases was performed. All articles providing a technical description of procedures, excluding cases limited to diagnostic procedures, specimen extraction, fluid drainage or gynecological procedures, were reviewed. Two reviewers systematically cataloged the technical details of each procedure and performed a frequency analysis of instrument use in each type of case. Available outcomes data were also compiled. RESULTS Forty-three discrete articles were reviewed in detail, describing a total of 432 operations consisting of transvaginal (n = 355), transgastric (n = 58), transesophageal (n = 17), and transrectal (n = 2) procedures, with 90% of cases performed in hybrid fashion with laparoscopic assistance. Cholecystectomy (84% of cases) was the most common procedure. Analysis of key steps included choice of endoscope, establishment of peritoneal access, dissection, specimen extraction, and closure of the access site. Analysis of instrument use during transvaginal cholecystectomy revealed variation in the choice of endoscope and the technique for establishment of access. A majority of these procedures relied heavily on the use of rigid and transabdominal instrumentation. Closure of the vaginotomy site was found to be well standardized, performed with an open suturing technique. Similar analysis for transgastric procedures revealed consistency in the choice of flexible endoscope as well as access and closure techniques. Perioperative outcomes from NOTES procedures were reported, but the data are currently limited due to small case numbers. CONCLUSIONS NOTES is most commonly performed using a hybrid, transvaginal approach. Although some aspects of these procedures appear to be well standardized, there is still significant variability in technique. More outcomes data with standardized reporting are needed to determine the actual risks and benefits of NOTES.","output":"Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES(?)): a technical review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The magnitude and kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific cell-mediated immunity (SARS-CoV-2-CMI) in kidney transplant (KT) recipients remain largely unknown. METHODS: We enumerated SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon-?3-producing CD69 CD4 and CD8 T-cells at months 4 and 6 from the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 21 KT recipients by intracellular cytokine staining. Overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein N-terminal 1- to 643-amino acid sequence and the membrane protein were used as stimulus. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the S1 protein were assessed by ELISA at month 6. RESULTS: Detectable (&#8805;0.1%) SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T-cell response was found in 57.1% and 47.4% of patients at months 4 and 6. Corresponding rates for CD8 T-cells were 19.0% and 42.1%, respectively. Absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell counts increased from month 4 to month 6 in CD8 (P-value = 0.086) but not CD4 subsets (P-value = 0.349). Four out of 10 patients with any detectable response at month 4 had lost SARS-CoV-2-CMI by month 6, whereas 5 out of 9 patients mounted SARS-CoV-2-CMI within this period. All but two patients (89.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Patients lacking detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 response by month 6 were more likely to be under tacrolimus (100.0% versus 66.7%; P-value = 0.087) and to have received tocilizumab for the previous COVID-19 episode (40.0% versus 0.0%; P-value = 0.087).

The mechanisms underlying these observations remain unknown, but evidence that patients may avoid healthcare facilities for fear of COVID-19 infection has heightened concern that true rates of myocardial infarctions have been underascertained and left untreated. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) and incident COVID-19 infections across the United States between January 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Grouping events by US Census Division, multivariable adjusted negative binomial regression models were utilized to estimate the relationship between COVID-19 and EMS activations for chest pain, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), cardiac arrests, and ventricular arrhythmias. Results: After multivariable adjustment, increasing rates of COVID-19 were associated with a reduction in EMS activations for chest pain (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.63-0.70, p < 0.001) and NSTEMIs (RR 0.16, 95% CI, 0.10-0.26;p < 0.001). Simultaneously, increasing COVID-19 was associated with a significant increase in EMS activations for cardiac arrests (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.36-1.68, p < 0.001), ventricular fibrillation (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.23-1.77, p < 0.001), and ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.16-1.56, p < 0.001). These statistically significant relationships were consistently observed within each of the 9 US Census Divisions alone. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that individuals are commonly delaying or avoiding care for myocardial infarction in areas with more COVID-19, leading to lethal consequences. Interventions aimed at reinforcing the need to seek appropriate care for suspected myocardial infarctions, even in the context of heightened infectious disease risks, should be pursued.","output":"Emergency activations for chest pain and ventricular arrhythmias related to regional covid-19 across the us"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: From 10 March up until 3 May 2020 in Northern Italy, the SARS-CoV-2 spread was not contained;disaster triage was adopted The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19-pandemic on the Orthopedic and Trauma departments, focusing on: hospital reorganization (flexibility, workload, prevalence of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2, standards of care);effects on staff;subjective orthopedic perception of the pandemic Material and Methods: Data regarding 1390 patients and 323 surgeons were retrieved from a retrospective multicentric database, involving 14 major hospitals The subjective directors viewpoints regarding the economic consequences, communication with the government, hospital administration and other departments were collected Results: Surgical procedures dropped by 73%, compared to 2019, elective surgery was interrupted Forty percent of patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2: 7% with positive results Seven percent of the patients received medical therapy for COVID-19, and only 48% of these treated patients had positive swab tests Eleven percent of surgeons developed COVID-19 and 6% were contaminated Fourteen percent of the staff were redirected daily to COVID units Communication with the Government was perceived as adequate, whilst communication with medical Authorities was considered barely sufficient Conclusions: Activity reduction was mandatory;the screening of carriers did not seem to be reliable and urgent activities were performed with a shortage of workers and a slower workflow A trauma network and dedicated in-hospital paths for COVID-19-patients were created This experience provided evidence for coordinated responses in order to avoid the propagation of errors","output":"Clinical Activities, Contaminations of Surgeons and Cooperation with Health Authorities in 14 Orthopedic Departments in North Italy during the Most Acute Phase of Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite numerous outbreaks, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNF) are not well described. We reviewed serological test results in a cohort of SNF residents who had been repetitively screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. METHODS: In late March 2019, we identified symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents at a SNF. In response, all remaining SNF patients were serially screened, and all SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were transferred to the acute care hospital or cohorted in a separate COVID Recovery Unit (CRU) in the SNF. In early June, all SNF residents (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative) underwent serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1/S2) IgG (DiaSorin). DiaSorin IgG-positive results for patients that were SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative were reflexed to nucleocapsid IgG (Abbott). Antibody testing occurred a median of 69 days (63C70 IQR) after PCR positivity. RESULTS: Nineteen SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents were identified from the outbreak and an additional 9 were transferred from the acute care hospital to the CRU; 1 died and 1 received convalescent plasma leaving 26 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive residents, including 6 who were asymptomatic, that were eligible for serologic testing. Twenty-four of the 26 were positive for IgG by the DiaSorin assay; one seronegative resident was one of the asymptomatic residents. There were an additional 121 residents in the SNF whose SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative at least once. Among these 121 SNF residents with negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, all but two were seronegative by the Diasorin assay.

Indicators of mental health included symptoms of adjustment disorder (ADNM-8);depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS-21);symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PC-PTSD-5);and well-being (WHO-5). Results In the entire sample, 9.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.9%, 14.0%) of the participants were at risk of adjustment disorder, 7.7% (95% CI: 6.7%, 11.9%) were at risk of depression disorder, and 7.8% (95% CI: 5.3%, 10.3%) were at risk of anxiety disorder. In addition, 7.2% (95% CI: 5.3%, 10.2%) were experiencing high levels of stress. The average well-being score was 56.5 (SD = 21.91) on a scale from 0 to 100.

There is also evidence suggesting elevated perfectionism may contribute to the onset and maintenance of non-suicidal self-injury. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy for perfectionism reduces perfectionism and symptoms of psychological disorders and that reductions are maintained at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. There may also be reductions in non-suicidal self-injury, although no study has investigated this potential benefit. Given that associations between perfectionism and psychopathology are observed across both adults and adolescents, the need for the development of interventions targeting adolescents is essential for early intervention and prevention. Methods The present study will employ a randomised controlled trial to examine the efficacy of 8-week guided Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy for perfectionism in adolescents compared to a waitlist control group. The primary outcome is perfectionism, and secondary outcomes include symptoms of psychological disorders, well-being, and non-suicidal self-injury.

A statistically significant decrease in body mass index (27.68 vs. 27.22 kg/m2;P < 0.0001) and an increase in HbA1c was noted in the post-lockdown period (8.31% vs. 8.70%;P < 0.0001). The mean Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score was 19.3 +/- 11.6. No significant correlation of mean IES-R score was observed with the age of the participants (r =-0.077, P = 0.224) and diabetes duration (r = 0.002, P = 0.970). Female gender (mean rank 140.4;P = 0.007) and co-existing hypertension (mean rank 132.18;P = 0.016) were associated with significantly higher IES-R score. No impact of total IES-R score was seen on the various lifestyle behaviors, diabetes self-management practices, and glycemic control. Conclusion: Psychological stress was higher among female gender and those with co-existing hypertension. Further, glycemic control worsened despite preserved diabetes self-management practices.","output":"Living with type 2 diabetes in COVID-19: Exploring the challenges faced"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but it remains obscure whether EBV is a viral cause of, or only an accompaniment of, NPC.

We believe that convincing evidence from these perspectives must be provided before we can ascertain the causal role of EBV infection in NPC. Specifically, (1) epidemiological studies should reveal EBV infection as a risk factor; (2) the introduction of EBV into an animal model should produce NPC; (3) in the animal model NPC, the main molecular event(s) or the involved signaling pathway(s) should be identical to that in human NPC; and (4) finally and most importantly, prevention of EBV infection or clearance of EBV from infected individuals must be able to reduce the incidence rate of NPC.","output":"The Criteria to Confirm the Role of Epstein-Barr Virus in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Initiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To retrospectively analyze serial chest radiographs in all patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong for temporal changes and differences between patients who died and those who were discharged from the hospital and to compare radiographic and clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study had ethics review board endorsement, and the need for informed consent was waived. Selected serial chest radiographs obtained from the time of presentation until discharge or death in 1373 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS were scored. Scoring was based on the area and location of lung opacification on radiographs obtained at each of five milestones (presentation, beginning of ribavirin therapy, beginning of corticosteroid therapy, time of most severe radiographic appearance of disease, and before discharge or death). Extents of lung opacification at these five milestones were compared between patients who died and those who survived (by using a repeated-measures analysis of variance model), and the temporal trend of the radiographic-clinical parameters was analyzed (by using Cochran-Armitage trend testing, Kendall tau correlation coefficients, and descriptive graphic analysis). RESULTS The final cohort consisted of 1373 patients (1212 of whom [485 male and 727 female patients; mean age, 38.4 years] survived and 161 of whom [84 male and 77 female patients; mean age, 63.0 years] died). Among survivors, older patients had more extensive radiographic changes than younger ones. However, among patients who died, older patients had less extensive radiographic opacification at the worst stage of disease and just before death than did younger patients. Despite a higher mortality risk for male patients, both sexes in the same outcome group had similar radiographic findings. For both outcome groups, the rate of radiographic progression was similar for the first 11 days but diverged afterwards. The extent of opacification increased by approximately one zone every 4-5 days for the initial 11 days. Radiographic scores correlated with the ratio of PaO2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase level, and neutrophil count at each milestone and in terms of changes between milestones (P < .01 for all correlation coefficients, except for radiographic score and neutrophil count between the first two milestones). CONCLUSION The initial extent of radiographic opacification may be useful for prognostic prediction. Radiographic progression correlates well with that of important clinical and laboratory parameters and may be used as an objective prognostic indicator early in SARS.","output":"Radiographic-clinical correlation in severe acute respiratory syndrome: study of 1373 patients in Hong Kong."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infection disease that rapidly spreads worldwide. Clinical features and outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients with influenza virus IgM positive during the influenza season need to be described. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 140 patients with severe COVID-19 hospitalized in designated wards of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital between Feb 8th and March 15th in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The demographic, clinical feature, laboratory, treatment and outcome were collected and analyzed. Results Of 140 severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 73 patients were with median age of 66 years old with identification of influenza virus IgM-positive and 67 patients were with median age of 62 years old in influenza virus IgM-negative group. Nearly half of severe COVID-19 patients in this research are male. Majority of the severe COVID-19 patients had chronic underlying conditions. Wheeze was the clinical feature of severe COVID-19 patients with influenza IgM-positive (26.4% vs 9.0%, P = 0.008). On contrary, fatigue or myalgia was the feature of the COVID-19 patients without IgM-positive (38.4% vs 58.2%, P = 0.019). In laboratory examination, increased levels of ferritin and prolonging APTT were showed in severe COVID-19 patients without influenza IgM-positive compared with patients in the other group with significant differences. Death rate in the group of severe COVID-19 patients with influenza IgM-positive is higher than it is in other group with significant differences (14.9% vs 4.1%, P = 0.040). In univariate regression analysis, several factors were associated with higher risk of death, which included LDH, troponin, NT-proBNP, D-dimer, PT, APTT, lymphocytes, platelet and eGFR. However, influenza virus IgM positive was associated with lower risk of death. Multivariate Regression analysis showed that troponin and lymphocyte were independently associated with higher risk of death. Conclusion The characteristics of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 with identification of influenza virus IgM-positive were described. It hints proof of seasonal influenza which may overlap with COVID-19 and may cause a crisis we could confront in the future.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcome of influenza virus infection among adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study from Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ivermectin was shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication in vitro, which has led to off-label use, but clinical efficacy has not been described previously. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does ivermectin benefit hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Charts of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in Florida with confirmed COVID-19 between March 15 and May 11, 2020, treated with or without ivermectin were reviewed. Hospital ivermectin dosing guidelines were provided, but treatment decisions were at the treating physician's discretion. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, and length of stay. Severe pulmonary involvement was defined as need for Fio2 &#8805; 50%, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation at study entry. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty patients, 173 treated with ivermectin and 107 without ivermectin, were reviewed. Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both. Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (15.0% vs 25.2%; OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P = .03). Mortality also was lower among ivermectin-treated patients with severe pulmonary involvement (38.8% vs 80.7%; OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.47; P = .001). No significant differences were found in extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%; OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 0.88-11.00; P = .07) or length of stay. After multivariate adjustment for confounders and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09-0.80; P = .03). One hundred ninety-six patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort. Mortality was significantly lower in the ivermectin group (13.3% vs 24.5%; OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22-0.99; P < .05), an 11.2% (95% CI, 0.38%-22.1%) absolute risk reduction, with a number needed to treat of 8.9 (95% CI, 4.5-263).

Subsequently, the filaments were ionized online by corona discharge and consecutively manipulated with an electric field created by disc electrodes. Such charging of the filaments and the effect of the electric field allowed for their ultrafast elongation and diameter reduction from 150 m down to fibers of 500 nm, which after collection exhibited fabric-like texture.

Previous reports are contradictory regarding an association with severe disease. METHODS Three hundred forty-six specimens from children with acute respiratory illness identified at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were evaluated by direct immunofluorescent assay and/or viral culture by Clinical Microbiology Laboratory and later by molecular study for the presence of influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and human bocavirus. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS Multiple viruses were detected in 46 (21.7%) of 212 virus-positive specimens with the most frequent virus-virus combinations being HRV-respiratory syncytial virus (n = 12), HRV-human bocavirus (n = 6) and HRV-parainfluenza virus 3 (n = 4). Risk factors for coinfection included male gender (OR [odds ratio]: 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-3.46), 6 months to 1 year age (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 0.75-6.19) and history of immunosuppression (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 0.99-4.23). Children with viral coinfections were less likely than children with single virus infections to be admitted to an intensive care unit (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.08-1.27); however, this may be explained by undetected viral-bacterial coinfections.

While EC(50) concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs. Furthermore, based on the relative EC(50)s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with Entamoeba histolytica, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.","output":"Emetine, Ipecac, Ipecac Alkaloids and Analogues as Potential Antiviral Agents for Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ecological research and practice are crucial to understanding and guiding more positive relationships between people and ecosystems.

Additionally, we surveyed students about their in-person versus online educational preferences. Results There were no statistically significant differences in student knowledge acquisition as assessed by weighted averages of summative assessments when comparing an in-person to a virtual educational platform. While the transition to virtual learning was initially well-received by students, our studied cohorts gave lower scores for the overall learning experience after prolonged virtual learning (p < 0.001). Students had a strong preference that anatomy and other group sessions should be delivered in-person. There was no strong preference whether other learning modalities should be given in-person or virtually. Conclusions Although student knowledge acquisition remained stable on a virtual platform, the student learning experience varied. We recommend that when returning to a new normal after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, sessions that require 3-dimensional or group learning should remain in-person, while other educational activities may be offered on a virtual platform and that, whenever virtual learning is employed, attention be paid to ensuring ongoing social and academic engagement between learners and faculty.","output":"A New Normal: Assessment Outcomes and Recommendations for Virtual Versus In-Person Curricula in Post-COVID-19 Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the co-seasonality and co-detection of respiratory viral infections and bacteraemia in children since the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13).

Monthly incidence rates of respiratory viruses and bacteraemia were analysed with a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) and cross-correlation functions using time series regression modelling. RESULTS: We identified 7,415 unique positive respiratory virus tests, including 2,278 RSV (31%), 1,825 influenza viruses (24%), 1,036 parainfluenza viruses (14%), 1,017 hMPV (14%), 677 seasonal coronaviruses (9%), and 582 adenoviruses (8%), and a total of 11,827 episodes of bacteraemia. Significant co-seasonality was found between all-cause bacteraemia and RSV (OR=1.76, 95% CI 1.50-2.06, P<0.001), influenza viruses (OR=1.38, 95% CI 1.13-1.68, P=0.002), and seasonal coronaviruses (OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.09-1.28, P<0.001), respectively.

Methods: We developed three models during the epidemic: a discrete model to predict the maximum burden on the health system in a short time framea basic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) model with discrete equations; a stochastic SEIR model with the Monte Carlo method; and a Gompertz-type model for metropolitan city of Santiago. Results: The maximum potential burden model has been useful throughout the monitoring of the epidemic, providing an upper bound for the number of cases, intensive care unit occupancy, and deaths. Deterministic and stochastic SEIR models were very useful in predicting the rise of cases and the peak and onset of case decline; however, they lost utility in the current situation due to the asynchronous recruitment of cases in the regions and the persistence of a strong endemic.

However, other host factors might also play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing new directions for antiviral treatments. GRP78 is a stress-inducible chaperone important for entry and infectivity for many viruses. Recent molecular docking analyses revealed putative interaction between GRP78 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (SARS-2-S). Here we report that GRP78 can form a complex with SARS-2-S and ACE2 on the surface and at the perinuclear region typical of the endoplasmic reticulum in VeroE6-ACE2 cells, and that the substrate binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this interaction. In vitro binding studies further confirmed that GRP78 can directly bind to the RBD of SARS-2-S and ACE2. To investigate the role of GRP78 in this complex, we knocked down GRP78 in VeroE6-ACE2 cells. Loss of GRP78 markedly reduced cell surface ACE2 expression and led to activation of markers of the unfolded protein response. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159) selected for its safe clinical profile in preclinical models, depleted cell surface GRP78 and reduced cell surface ACE2 expression, as well as SARS-2-S-driven viral entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Our data suggest that GRP78 is an important host auxiliary factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection and a potential target to combat this novel pathogen and other viruses that utilize GRP78 in combination therapy.","output":"The chaperone GRP78 is a host auxiliary factor for SARS-CoV-2 and GRP78 depleting antibody blocks viral entry and infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning based methods for diagnosis and progression prediction of COVID-19 from imaging data have gained significant attention in the last months, in particular by the use of deep learning models.

This study estimates the prevalence of COVID-19 among farmers and farmworkers in the United States by coupling county-level data on the number of farm workers relative to the general population with data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. In the 13 month period since the start of the pandemic (from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021), the estimated cumulative number of COVID-19 cases (deaths) was 329,031 (6,166) among agricultural producers, 170,137 (2,969) among hired agricultural workers, 202,902 (3,812) among unpaid agricultural workers, and 27,223 (459) among migrant agricultural workers. The cases amount to 9.55%, 9.31%, 9.39%, and 9.01% of all U.S. agricultural producers, hired workers, unpaid workers, and migrant workers, respectively. The COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly higher in counties with more agricultural workers; a 1% increase in the number of hired agricultural workers in a county is associated with a 0.04% increase in the number of COVID-19 cases per person and 0.07% increase in deaths per person. Although estimated new cases among farm workers exhibit similar trends to that of the general population, the correlation between the two is sometimes negative, highlighting the need to monitor this particular population that tends to live in more rural areas.

In the absence of data this review utilizes the Ring Theory of Personhood (RToP) to evaluate how a physician's concept of personhood is affected caring for terminally ill children in order to better support them holistically. METHODS Using PRISMA Guidelines, 14 researchers carried out independent searches of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and gray literature databases for articles published between 2000 to 2019. Concurrent and independent employment of content and thematic analysis (Split Approach) was used to enhance the trustworthiness of the analysis. RESULTS 13,424 titles and abstracts were retrieved, 188 full texts were evaluated, and 39 articles were included and analyzed. Identical categories and themes identified using the Split Approach suggest that caring for dying children in PPC impacts the physician's professional identity, clinical decision making, personal well-being and relationships. The data also suggests that the magnitude of these effects depends on the presence of protective and risk factors. CONCLUSION Aside from providing a novel insight into the upon the physician, this review proffers a unique approach to accounting for the presence, magnitude and influence of incoming catalysts, resultant conflicts, and protective and risk factors upon the physician's personhood.

METHODS: : The Collaborative Outcome study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH-FIT C www.coh-fit.com) is an on-line anonymous survey, available in 30 languages, involving >220 investigators from 49 countries supported by national/international professional associations. COH-FIT has thee waves (until the pandemic is declared over by the WHO, and 6-18 months plus 24-36 months after its end). In addition to adults, COH-FIT also includes adolescents (age 14-17 years), and children (age 6-13 years), recruited via non-probability/snowball and representative sampling and assessed via self-rating and parental rating. Non-modifiable/modifiable risk factors/treatment targets to inform prevention/intervention programs to promote health and prevent mental and physical illness in children and adolescents will be generated by COH-FIT. Co-primary outcomes are changes in well-being (WHO-5) and a composite psychopathology P-Score. Multiple behavioral, family, coping strategy and service utilization factors are also assessed, including functioning and quality of life. RESULTS: : Up to June 2021, over 13,000 children and adolescents from 59 countries have participated in the COH-FIT project, with representative samples from eleven countries.

Risk is particularly relevant in relation to endoscopy procedures. This study aimed to describe a contingency plan for a tertiary academic cancer center, define a strategy to prioritize and postpone examinations, and evaluate the infection rate among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the endoscopy unit of the Cancer Institute of the State of S?o Paulo (ICESP). METHODS: We created a strategy to balance the risk of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and to mitigate the effects of postponing endoscopic procedures in oncological patients. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on all endoscopies between March and June 2020 compared with those during the same period in 2019 was carried out. All HCWs were interviewed to obtain clinical data and SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a reduction of 55% in endoscopy cases in total. Colonoscopy was the most affected modality. The total infection rate among all HCWs was 38%. None of the senior digestive endoscopists had COVID-19. However, all bronchoscopists had been infected. One of three fellows had a serological diagnosis of COVID-19. Two-thirds of all nurses were infected, whereas half of all technicians were infected. CONCLUSIONS: In this pandemic scenario, all endoscopy services must prioritize the procedures that will be performed. It was possible to maintain some endoscopic procedures, including those meant to provide nutritional access, tissue diagnosis, and endoscopic resection.

Such programs may help alleviate some of the detrimental impacts of social distancing and quarantine on older adults at-risk of decline. METHODS: Data were derived from the feasibility arm of a parent study, which piloted the telehealth program for 36 sessions with 1 participant. The steps involved in each phase (ie, development, delivery) were documented, along with participant and program provider considerations for each step. Time-driven activity-based costing was used to track all costs over the course of the study. Costs were categorized as program development or delivery and estimated per session and per participant. RESULTS: A list of the steps and the participant and provider considerations involved in developing and delivering a synchronous telehealth exercise program for older adults with functional impairments was developed. Resources used, fixed and variable costs, per-session cost estimates, and total cost per person were reported. Two potential measures of the value proposition of this type of intervention were also reported. Per-session cost of $158 appears to be a feasible business case, especially if the physical therapist to trained assistant personnel mix could be improved.

Many organizations have conducted surveys to understand peoples opinions toward WFH. However, the findings are limited owing to a small sample size and the dynamic topics over time. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand public opinions regarding WFH in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale social media study using Twitter data to portray different groups of individuals who have positive or negative opinions on WFH. We performed an ordinary least squares regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the sentiment about WFH and user characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, median household income, and population density. To better understand the public opinion, we used latent Dirichlet allocation to extract topics and investigate how tweet contents are related to peoples attitude. RESULTS: On performing ordinary least squares regression analysis using a large-scale data set of publicly available Twitter posts (n=28,579) regarding WFH during April 10-22, 2020, we found that the sentiment on WFH varies across user characteristics. In particular, women tend to be more positive about WFH (P<.001). People in their 40s are more positive toward WFH than those in other age groups (P<.001). People from high-income areas are more likely to have positive opinions about WFH (P<.001). These nuanced differences are supported by a more fine-grained topic analysis. At a higher level, we found that the most negative sentiment about WFH roughly corresponds to the discussion on government policy. However, people express a more positive sentiment when discussing topics on remote work or study and encouragement. Furthermore, topic distributions vary across different user groups. Women pay more attention to family activities than men (P<.05). Older people talk more about work and express a more positive sentiment regarding WFH. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a large-scale social mediaCbased study to understand the public opinion on WFH in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) can be used as a close proxy for the circulation of influenza viruses. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in patients with ILI. Using distributed lag nonlinear models, we analyzed the association between ILI, meteorological variables and particulate matter concentration in Bialystok, Poland, from 2013-2019. We found an exponential relationship between cumulative PM2.5 pollution and the incidence of ILI, which remained significant after adjusting for air temperatures and a long-term trend. Pollution had the greatest effect during the same week, but the risk of ILI was increased for the four following weeks. The risk of ILI was also increased by low air temperatures, low absolute humidity, and high wind speed.

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting 16 hospitals in 9 countries. Patients 10 402 patients aged 45 years or older having inpatient noncardiac surgery. Measurements All patients had NT-proBNP levels measured before surgery and troponin T levels measured daily for up to 3 days after surgery. Results In multivariable analyses, compared with preoperative NT-proBNP values less than 100 pg/mL (the reference group), those of 100 to less than 200 pg/mL, 200 to less than 1500 pg/mL, and 1500 pg/mL or greater were associated with adjusted hazard ratios of 2.27 (95% CI, 1.90 to 2.70), 3.63 (CI, 3.13 to 4.21), and 5.82 (CI, 4.81 to 7.05) and corresponding incidences of the primary outcome of 12.3% (226 of 1843), 20.8% (542 of 2608), and 37.5% (223 of 595), respectively. Adding NT-proBNP thresholds to clinical stratification (that is, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index [RCRI]) resulted in a net absolute reclassification improvement of 258 per 1000 patients. Preoperative NT-proBNP values were also statistically significantly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality (less than 100 pg/mL [incidence, 0.3%], 100 to less than 200 pg/mL [incidence, 0.7%], 200 to less than 1500 pg/mL [incidence, 1.4%], and 1500 pg/mL or greater [incidence, 4.0%]). Limitation External validation of the identified NT-proBNP thresholds in other cohorts would reinforce our findings.

To combat transmission of the disease in India, the government declared a lockdown on March 25, 2020. Even after this strict lockdown was enacted nationwide, the number of COVID-19 cases increased and surpassed 450,000. A positive point to note is that the number of recovered cases began to slowly exceed that of active cases. The survival of patients, taking death as the event that varies by age group and sex, is noteworthy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a survival analysis to establish the variability in survivorship of patients with COVID-19 in India by age group and sex at different levels, that is, the national, state, and district levels. METHODS: The study period was taken from the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 in India, which was January 30, 2020, up to June 30, 2020. Due to the amount of underreported data and removal of missing columns, a total sample of 26,815 patients was considered. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, the Cox proportional hazard model, and the multilevel survival model were used to perform the survival analysis. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival function showed that the probability of survival of patients with COVID-19 declined during the study period of 5 months, which was supplemented by the log rank test (P<.001) and Wilcoxon test (P<.001) to compare the survival functions. Significant variability was observed in the age groups, as evident from all the survival estimates; with increasing age, the risk of dying of COVID-19 increased. The Cox proportional hazard model reiterated that male patients with COVID-19 had a 1.14 times higher risk of dying than female patients (hazard ratio 1.14; SE 0.11; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Western and Central India showed decreasing survival rates in the framed time period, while Eastern, North Eastern, and Southern India showed slightly better results in terms of survival.

In contrast, non-fatal suicidal behaviour declines with age and more closely resembles suicide than in younger age groups.

In more recent years, increasing interest in the use of local therapy for metastases likely has arisen from improvements in systemic therapy. In the absence of effective systemic therapies, such local treatments were often considered futile given both the difficulty in eliminating all sites of identifiable metastatic disease as well as realities regarding the rapid natural history of uncontrolled tumor dissemination. However, with a higher likelihood of patients surviving longer after effective systemic therapy, even if not cured, the goal of the eradication of residual metastases via potent local therapies can be rationalized. However, this rationalization should be evidence-based so as to avoid harming patients for no established benefit. Although surgical metastectomy remains the most common and first-line standard among local therapies, nonsurgical alternatives, including thermal ablation and stereotactic body radiotherapy, have become increasingly popular because they are generally less invasive than surgery and have demonstrated considerable promise in eradicating macroscopic tumor.

Despite these successes, the application of DMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains challenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable predictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained, restricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the biological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a compartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves within states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately recreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper knowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that the behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In this work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing DMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover useful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting compartment-wise.

The mathematical and numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to this common class of problems.

Previously worn N95 filtering facepiece respirators can serve as a source of pathogens, which can be transferred to the wearer while doffing and donning a respirator when practicing reuse. When practicing limited filtering facepiece respirators reuse, to reduce the risk of self-contamination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends storing filtering facepiece respirators for five days between uses to allow for the decay of viable pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. This study assesses the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 on N95 filtering facepiece respirators under controlled storage conditions for up to five days to inform the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. Coupons excised from six N95 filtering facepiece respirator models and glass slide coverslips were inoculated with the virus in a defined culture medium and in human saliva and stored at 20 C and 20%, 45%, and 75% relative humidity. Statistically significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 half-lives were measured among the tested humidity levels with half-lives decreasing from an average of approximately 30 hours at 20% relative humidity to approximately 2 hours at 75% relative humidity. Significant differences in virus half-lives were also observed between the culture medium and saliva suspension media at 20% and 45% relative humidity with half lives up to 2.9 times greater when the virus was suspended in cell culture medium.

Healthcare educators need to balance the relatively high cost to deliver simulation education with the potential impact on healthcare quality. It is unclear how to prioritize simulation in critical care education, especially considering interprofessional needs across adult and pediatric populations. The objective of this study was to prioritize topics for critical care educators developing simulation-based educational interventions. Methodology A modified Delphi process was used to identify and prioritize critical care topics taught using simulation. We disseminated a multi-institutional survey to understand critical care simulation topics using a three-round modified Delphi technique. An expert panel was recruited based on their expertise with simulation-based education through the Society for Simulation in Healthcare and the Society of Critical Care Medicine lists. Critical care topics originated using content derived from multiple critical care board examination contents. Additional content for a critical care simulation-based curriculum was generated. Results Consensus and prioritization were achieved in three rounds, with 52 simulation experts participating. The first Delphi round surveyed priority topics in critical care content and generated additional topics for inclusion in round two. The second Delphi round added the content with the highest-ranked items from round one to generate a set of simulation-based topic priorities. The third Delphi round asked participants to determine the importance of each priority item taught via simulation compared to other modalities for clinical education. This round yielded 106 topics over four domains categorized into (1) Diagnosis and Management of Clinical Problems, (2) Procedural Skills, (3) Teamwork and Communication Skills, and (4) General Knowledge and Knowledge of Technical Adjuncts. Conclusions The modified Delphi survey revealed a prioritized, consensus-based list of topics and domains for critical care educators to focus on when creating a simulation-based critical care curriculum.

METHODS: We investigated variables such as the outbreak setting, age of patients, vaccination status, and lesion count. The collected data were analyzed with the Cochrane-Armitage trend test and Kruskal-Wallis test. These statistical tests were performed using R ver. 4.0.3. RESULTS: The number of varicella outbreaks increased from 2016 to 2018; however, after a slight decrease in the number of outbreaks in 2019, the number fell sharply in 2020. The median size of outbreaks decreased from 8 to 9 cases during 2016?2019 to 6 cases in 2020. The median duration of outbreaks was 18 days during 2016?2017, 28 days in 2018, 29 days in 2019, and 15 days in 2020. Varicella outbreaks occurred most frequently in elementary schools, and vaccination coverage of patients increased from 89.4% in 2016 to 97.2% in 2019. The median age of patients with outbreak-related varicella decreased from 8 years in 2016 to 6 years in 2020.

An alternative to antibiotic treatment in patients with infected wounds with local signs of inflammation may be medical-grade honey (MGH), which favourably affects the healing process with its antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of MGH therapy on the healing process of non-healing wounds of various aetiologies and different wound colonisations. Prospective, observationCintervention case studies (n = 9) of patients with wounds of various aetiologies (venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, surgical wound dehiscence) are presented. All wounds were treated with MGH and the healing trajectory was rigorously and objectively monitored. In all cases, pain, odour, and exudation were quickly resolved, which led to an improvement in the quality of life of patients. Despite the proven bacterial microflora in wounds, antibiotic treatment was not necessary. The effects of MGH alleviated the signs of local infection until their complete elimination. In eight out of nine cases, the non-healing wound was completely healed.

Pregnant women were categorised as at risk requiring extra vigilance with behavioural guidelines. Their understanding and ability to adhere to recommendations was unknown. Objectives: To complete a behavioural analysis of the determinants of recommended social distancing behaviour in pregnant women, according to the capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour (COM-B) model to inform the development of recommendations/materials to support pregnant women in understanding and adhering to behavioural guidelines. Design: Qualitative interview study with pregnant women in the Bristol area (UK). Methods: Semi-structured telephone/videoconference interviews were conducted following a topic guide informed by the COM-B model, transcribed verbatim and subjected to framework analysis. Infographic materials were iteratively produced with stakeholder consultation, to support pregnant womens behaviour. Results: Thirty-one women participated (selected for demographic range). Women reported adhering to social distancing recommendations and intended to continue. COM-B analysis identified gaps in understanding around risk, vulnerability, and the extent of required social distancing, as well as facilitators of social distancing behaviour (e.g. social support, motivation to stay safe, home environment/resources). Additional themes around detrimental mental health effects and changes to maternity healthcare from the social distancing measures were identified. Infographic resources (plus midwife report) addressing womens key concerns were produced and disseminated. Conclusions: The COM-B model provided useful details of determinants of pregnant womens adherence to social distancing behaviours. The confusion of what being at risk meant and varying interpretation of what was expected indicates a need for greater clarity around categories and guidance. The loss of maternity care and negative mental health effects of social distancing suggests a growing area of unmet health needs to be addressed in future.","output":"Capability, Opportunity and Motivation of pregnant women to enact social distancing behaviour in the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK: A qualitative interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has broken down the global medical order tremendously, we urgently need an efficient treatment.

Understanding why individuals are vaccine hesitant can establish paths to increase vaccinations. As the COVID-19 vaccine landscape develops, reasons for hesitancy have likely shifted over time. Methods & Materials We gathered 757,618 responses between December 6, 2020, and June 13, 2021, from a validated web survey administered by OutbreaksNearMe.org on Momentive.ai. From December 6 to January 11, individuals self-reported on willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and starting January 12, their COVID-19 vaccination status. Those who indicated being unsure or not planning to get vaccinated were prompted to report their reasoning (non-exclusive.) Proportions of reasoning were calculated as the number indicating that reason over the total question responses. Proportions were compared across time intervals with significant vaccine, pandemic guideline, and political occurrences. Results 47.1% of the study population are vaccinated, 11.5% are unsure about vaccination, and 11.9% have no plans to get vaccinated. Prior to vaccine approval, 47.2% indicated enough hesitancy to delay vaccination, and 10.8% indicated not wanting any potential COVID-19 vaccine. Overall, the top reported hesitancy reasons were The vaccine being too new/not enough data (60.8%) and Concerns about side effects (60.0%). Lack of trust in government and Lack of trust in scientists were less prevalent initially (28.1% and 11.0%), but have been increasing since January 2021, reaching 50.2% and 40.2% in June. COVID-19 being an exaggerated threat also follows this trend, starting at 8.7% and reaching 31.6%. Already had COVID-19 and Never get any vaccine are also increasing in prevalence across time, at a slower rate. Different hesitancy reasons have steeper increases throughout the study period corresponding to certain events like new guidelines for vaccinated persons. Conclusion Concerns surrounding side effects and the vaccines newness were consistently the top reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across the study population. Higher prevalence of lack of trust in government, science, and COVID-19 being exaggerated reasoning have been observed over time. Hesitancy reasoning seems somewhat influenced by significant events, however, those still not getting vaccinated have different reasoning for their hesitancy than was observed earlier in the pandemic.","output":"Assessing the Shift in Reasoning for COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in the United States Using a Six-Month Cross-Sectional Analysis from December 2020 to June 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Information on SARS-CoV-2 in representative community surveillance is limited, particularly cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for viral load). METHODS: We included all positive nose and throat swabs 26 April 2020 to 13 March 2021 from the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey, tested by RT-PCR for the N, S, and ORF1ab genes. We investigated predictors of median Ct value using quantile regression. RESULTS: Of 3,312,159 nose and throat swabs, 27,902 (0.83%) were RT-PCR-positive, 10,317 (37%), 11,012 (40%), and 6550 (23%) for 3, 2, or 1 of the N, S, and ORF1ab genes, respectively, with median Ct = 29.2 (~215 copies/ml; IQR Ct = 21.9C32.8, 14C56,400 copies/ml). Independent predictors of lower Cts (i.e. higher viral load) included self-reported symptoms and more genes detected, with at most small effects of sex, ethnicity, and age. Single-gene positives almost invariably had Ct > 30, but Cts varied widely in triple-gene positives, including without symptoms. Population-level Cts changed over time, with declining Ct preceding increasing SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Of 6189 participants with IgG S-antibody tests post-first RT-PCR-positive, 4808 (78%) were ever antibody-positive; Cts were significantly higher in those remaining antibody negative.

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the actual frailty conditions and lifestyle changes among community-dwelling older adults affected by COVID-19 countermeasures in Japan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between May 8 and June 12, 2020. Self-reported questionnaires were distributed to 1,078 older adults aged 65 years. We used the frailty screening index to assess frailty status and developed the Questionnaire for Change of Life (QCL) to assess lifestyle changes, the amount of daily movement, leg muscle strength, meal size, worry or anxiety, and opportunities to talk to people. The differences in prevalence rates of frailty, prefrailty, and robustness between this study and the reference based on the Japanese meta-analysis were verified using the chi-square goodness of fit test. We compared each of the QCL results among the frailty, prefrailty, and robust groups using Fishers exact test. RESULTS: Of 680 older adults (63.1%) analyzed, 60 (8.8%) had frailty and 354 (52.1%) had prefrailty. There was a significant difference between the observed and expected prevalence based on the reference (p = 0.018). The frailty status was significantly associated with lifestyle changes. In participants with frailty, the amount of daily movement, leg muscle strength, and meal size significantly decreased (p < 0.001), whereas worry or anxiety significantly increased (p = 0.040). In contrast, regardless of the frailty status, opportunities to talk to people decreased. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of frailty and prefrailty might have increased due to the effects of COVID-19 countermeasures. Moreover, the lifestyle of community-dwelling older adults affected by COVID-19 countermeasures has changed. Lifestyle changes were more pronounced among older adults with frailty.","output":"Actual Frailty Conditions and Lifestyle Changes in Community-Dwelling Older Adults Affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 Countermeasures in Japan: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"These are unprecedented times while the world weathers the highly infectious respiratory pandemic caused by coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Humanity has experienced other cataclysmic events, but something as novel as this pandemic cannot be easily described. A safe COVID-19 vaccine is often hailed as the only effective public health method to prevent the further spread of this virus. New vaccines cost has increased even as policymakers struggle with limited resources and budget constraints. Thus, more decision-support tools are needed to facilitate the selection of vaccine manufacturers as part of a global immunization strategy against COVID-19 or other epidemics and pandemics. This study sought to address this issue by combining three well-established operational research methods (i.e., cognitive mapping, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, and the Choquet integral). Based on the insights provided by a panel of experts on vaccination and infectious diseases, a vaccine manufacturer selection mechanism was developed that incorporates the World Health Organizations guidelines. This approach facilitated the identification of multiple selection criteria regarding vaccine manufacturers, their allocation into six major clusters (i.e., soundness of scientific approach and technology used; speed of delivery; cost; liability and risk sharing; ability to supply sufficient quantities through production capacity development; and global solidarity), and subsequent analysis of the respective cause-and-effect relationships. The results of a real-life application of the proposed selection system were further consolidated by a member of Saint Francisco Xavier Hospital Infectious Diseases Unit in Lisbon, Portugal.

METHODS: Rapid review, drawing on the World Health Organization's (WHO) methodology for developing interim guidelines during health emergencies. PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central and Campbell Collaboration searched up to mid-April 2020. Searches were supplemented by reference-searching and expert recommendations. Searches were designed to identify: (1) systematic reviews (<10 years), or (2) primary intervention studies (no date limit) reporting evidence on anti-stigma interventions (in relation to COVID-19 or other infectious/stigmatised conditions) or (3) additional relevant materials. Data were extracted on population, intervention, outcome and results. These data were compiled into evidence summary tables and narrative overviews. Recommendations on strategies for COVID-19 stigma-reduction were developed using the WHO Evidence to Decision framework approach. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42020177677). RESULTS: The searches identified a total of 4150 potentially relevant records, from which 12 systematic reviews and 29 additional articles were included. Overarching considerations and specific recommendations focus on: (1) language/words used in relation to COVID-19 and affected people; (2) media/journalistic practices; (3) public health interventions; (4) targeted public health interventions for key groups and (5) involving communities and key stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations represent the first consolidated evidence-based guidance on stigma and discrimination reduction in relation to COVID-19. Mitigating the impact of stigma is critical in reducing distress and negative experiences, and strengthening communities' resolve to work together during exceptional circumstances. Ultimately, reducing stigma helps addressing structural inequalities that drive marginalisation and exacerbate both health risks and the impact of stigma.

The patients were randomly divided into two groups by receiving either topical tacrolimus 0.1% or cyclosporine 1% respectively. Twenty five patients were treated with topical tacrolimus 0.1% and 24 patients with topical cyclosporine 1%. The traditional baseline management on these two groups were Tobramycin and Dexamethasone eye drops in the first 3 weeks and then tapered off. Clinical procedures and postoperative follow-up were documented. RESULTS: After 6C54 months follow-up, with the average of 24 months, 11 of 24 high-risk patients (11 eyes) had graft rejection, the rejection rate was 45.8% in topical cyclosporine 1% group. The rejections occurred from 35 days to 20 months after PKP. Three patients had irreversible rejection. On topical tacrolimus 0.1% group, the rejection occurred in four patients (four eyes) with rejection rate of 16%, and no irreversible rejection was observed. The graft rejection episodes were documented between 23 days and 24 months.

In this paper, we compute a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to analyze the relationship between tourist departures from Mexico and a modified misery index to measure the effect of the loss of well-being, measured in terms of this index, on the number of outbound tourists. The results indicate that increases in the misery index have negative effects on the number of outbound tourists. Conversely, there is no statistically significant effect of tourist departures on the misery index.

Here we report changes from 2013 to 2018 in PrEP and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) awareness and use among HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and assess predictors of PrEP initiation. METHODS: In the prospective cohort study Attitudes to, and Understanding of Risk of Acquisition of HIV 2 (AURAH2), MSM were recruited from three sexual health clinics in England: two in London and one in Brighton, UK. Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status. Participants self-completed a baseline paper questionnaire at one of the three clinics between July 30, 2013, and April 30, 2016, and were subsequently able to complete 4-monthly and annual online questionnaires, which were available between March 1, 2015, and March 31, 2018, and collected information on sociodemographics, health and wellbeing, HIV status, and sexual behaviours. PrEP and PEP use in the previous 12 months was obtained at baseline and in annual questionnaires. We assessed trends over calendar time in 3-month periods from first enrolment to the end of the study period (JulyCDecember, 2013, was counted as one period) in use of PrEP and PEP using generalised estimating equation logistic models. We used age-adjusted Poisson models to assess factors associated with PrEP initiation among participants who reported never having used PrEP at baseline. FINDINGS: 1162 men completed a baseline questionnaire, among whom the mean age was 34 years (SD 104), and of those with available data, 942 (82%) of 1150 were white, 1076 (94%) of 1150 were gay, and 857 (74%) of 1159 were university educated. 622 (54%) of 1162 men completed at least one follow-up online questionnaire, of whom 483 (78%) completed at least one annual questionnaire. Overall, PrEP use in the past year increased from 0% (none of 28 respondents) in July to December, 2013, to 43% (23 of 53) in January to March, 2018. The corresponding increase in PrEP use among men who reported condomless sex with two or more partners was from 0% (none of 13 respondents) to 78% (21 of 27). PEP use peaked in April to June, 2016, at 28% (41 of 147 respondents), but decreased thereafter to 8% (four of 53) in January to March, 2018. Among 460 men who had never used PrEP at baseline, predictors of initiating PrEP included age 40C44 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 425, 95% CI 114C1579) and 45 years and older (359, 108C1197) versus younger than 25 years; and after adjustment for age, recent HIV test (517, 189C1408), condomless sex (501, 216C1163), condomless sex with two or more partners (543, 299C986), group sex (169, 101C284), and non-injection chemsex-related drugs use (286, 167C491) in the past 3 months, PEP use (469, 283C779) in the past 12 months, and calendar year (Jan 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 vs July 30, 2013, to Dec 31, 2015: 2119, 948C4735). Non-employment (035, 014C091) and unstable or no housing (vs homeowner 013, 002C095) were associated with reduced rates of PrEP initiation after adjustment for age. About half of PrEP was obtained via the internet, even after the PrEP Impact trial had started (11 [48%] of 23 respondents in January to March, 2018).

Sensitization to allergens with the potential for allergic contact dermatitis is a factor associated with cases of recalcitrant atopic dermatitis. Understanding the relationship between atopic dermatitis, allergens, and allergic contact dermatitis is essential. In Brazil, there are no studies on sensitization to allergens found in patch tests with pediatric batteries in patients with atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVES: To verify the main sensitizing agents, the prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis and the epidemiological and clinical profile of children and adolescents with atopic dermatitis. METHODS: Cross-sectional, prospective study in patients between 4 and 18 years of age, with recalcitrant atopic dermatitis, treated at the Sanitary Dermatology Outpatient Clinic (RS). All patients underwent patch tests with a battery of pediatric allergens. RESULTS: The prevalence of sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis in the evaluated patients was 37.07% (20/54) and 27.7% (15/54), respectively. The most frequent allergens were: nickel sulfate (16.7%), disperse blue (5.6%), and fragrance mix I (5.6%). Nickel was associated with the female sex (p = 0.019).

Our study investigates the impacts of a major recall and shortage of valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), in July 2018 in Canada. METHODS: We conducted a time-series analysis of antihypertensive drugs dispensed in Canada between 2015 and 2019 using commercially available retail prescription data. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, we evaluated the change in valsartan use after the recall. We also measured the overall use of ARBs, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other antihypertensive drug classes for the same period. RESULTS: After the recall in July 2018, valsartan use decreased 57.8%, from 362 231 prescriptions dispensed in June 2018 to 152 892 in September 2018 (difference = 209 339, p < 0.0001). Overall use of the ARB drug class decreased 2.0%, from 1 577 509 prescriptions dispensed in June 2018 to 1 545 591 in September 2018 (difference = 31 918, p = 0.0003), but use of non-valsartan ARBs increased 14.6%, from 1 215 278 to 1 392 699 prescriptions dispensed (difference = 177 421, p < 0.0001) in the same time frame. Although use of ACE inhibitors initially declined, this reduction was not sustained. The valsartan recall was not associated with a significant impact on use of other antihypertensive drug classes. INTERPRETATION: Our findings illustrate the impact of a major drug shortage, with the immediate and substantial reduction of valsartan dispensed and cascading effects on other ARBs, though future research is warranted to understand the consequences of such extensive shortages on clinical outcomes and health system costs. Improved policy strategies are needed to address the underlying causes of drug shortages and to mitigate their effects.","output":"Extent of a valsartan drug shortage and its effect on antihypertensive drug use in the Canadian population: a national cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continuous cell lines that originate from mammalian tissues serve as not only invaluable tools for life sciences, but also important animal cell substrates for the production of various types of biological pharmaceuticals.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series of consecutive ARDS COVID-19 patients admitted and treated in our MCCU. SETTING: 36-bed MCCU in referral tertiary hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal/pharyngeal swabs. INTERVENTIONS: None MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. RESULTS: Forty-four ARDS COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Median age was 61.50 (53.25 - 67) years and most of the patients were male (72.7%). Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent co-morbidities (52.3 and 36.4% respectively). Steroids (1mg/Kg/day) and tocilizumab were administered in almost all patients (95.5%). 77.3% of the patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 16 days [11-28]. Prone position ventilation was performed in 33 patients (97%) for a median of 3 sessions [2-5] per patient. Nosocomial infection was diagnosed in 13 patients (29.5%).

METHODS: Through retrospective analysis of the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative national database, we measured the change in each individual component of the HerQLes questionnaire from a pre-operative baseline assessment to one-year postoperatively in VHR patients.

The oncology community has undertaken substantial workflow adaptations to reduce transmission risk for patients and providers. While various control measures have been proposed and implemented, little is known about their impact on safety of the radiation oncology workflow and potential for transmission. The objective of this study was to assess potential safety impacts of control measures employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A multi-institutional study was undertaken to assess the risks of pandemic-associated workflow adaptations using failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). Failure modes were identified and scored using FMEA formalism. FMEA scores were used to identify highest-risk aspects of the radiation therapy process. The impact of control measures on overall risk was quantified. Agreement among institutions was evaluated. RESULTS: 33 failure modes and 22 control measures were identified. Control measures resulted in risk score reductions for 22 of the failure modes, with the largest reductions from screening of patients and staff, requiring use of masks, and regular cleaning of patient areas. The median risk score for all failure modes was reduced from 280 to 168. There was high institutional agreement for 90.3% of failure modes but only 47% of control measures. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-related risks are similar across oncology practices in this study. While control measures can reduce risk, their use varied.

Contact patterns changed over time and by participants' age, personal risk factors, and perception of risk. The mean of reported contacts among adults have reduced compared to previous surveys with adults aged 18 to 59 reporting a mean of 2.39 (95% CI 2.20 - 2.60) contacts to 4.93 (95% CI 4.65 - 5.19) contacts, and the mean contacts for school-age children was 3.07 (95% CI 2.89 - 3.27) to 15.11 (95% CI 13.87 - 16.41). The use of face coverings outside the home has remained high since the government mandated use in some settings in July 2020. Conclusions: The CoMix survey provides a unique longitudinal data set for a full year since the first lockdown for use in statistical analyses and mathematical modelling of COVID-19 and other diseases. Recorded contacts reduced dramatically compared to pre-pandemic levels, with changes correlated to government interventions throughout the pandemic. Despite easing of restrictions in the summer of 2020, mean reported contacts only returned to about half of that observed pre-pandemic.","output":"CoMix: Changes in social contacts as measured by the contact survey during the 1 COVID-19 pandemic in England between March 2020 and March 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (Covid-19) is continuously spreading all over the world now with different variances like alpha, beta, gamma, Epsilon, and Zeta. There are numerous careful steps are taken to minimize the spread of corona virus. Wearing face mask is one among the important measures that people should follow but unfortunately the majority of individuals are not following this safety measure in public spaces. In this paper, we have proposed a novel face mask detection model by cascading three CNN models such as YOLO V3, Facenet and Mobilenet. Here, YOLO V3 model is used for detecting people in a surveillance video data which helps to reduce the search space for face detection techniques. Second CNN model namely Facenet is incorporated to detect the face which is then fed to Mobilenet for mask detection. In the proposed work, mask detection is considered as a binary class problem where a people without mask are discriminated from the people with face mask. A transfer learning is adopted for YOLO V3 and Facenet models. The output layer of Mobilenet is modified for the binary classification.

A total of 458 nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples (426 positive and 32 negative) were tested with the MB assay and the fluorescence levels compared with the cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from a commercial RT-PCR test in terms of test duration, sensitivity, and specificity. Our results show that the samples with higher fluorescence levels correspond to those with low Ct values, suggesting a correlation between viral load and increased MB fluorescence.

In the present review, we look at key differences among importin- isoforms and provide a comprehensive inventory of known viral and cellular cargoes that have been shown to associate preferentially with specific isoforms. We illustrate how the diversification of the adaptor importin  into seven isoforms expands the dynamic range and regulatory control of nucleocytoplasmic transport, offering unexpected opportunities for pharmacological intervention.

Yet, current methods for screening these two issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and blocked by social stigma and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube has undergone drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in depression and anxiety profiles of users in a noninvasive manner. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationships of deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions with the changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. METHODS: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a US college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 features that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the correlations of deteriorating depression and anxiety profiles with each of these features. We finally demonstrated the feasibility of using the proposed features to build predictive machine learning models. RESULTS: Of the 49 participants, 49% (n=24) of them reported an increase in the PHQ-9 depression scores; 53% (n=26) of them reported an increase in the GAD-7 anxiety scores. The results showed that a number of online behavior features were significantly correlated with deteriorations in the PHQ-9 scores (r ranging between -0.37 and 0.75, all P values less than or equal to .03) and the GAD-7 scores (r ranging between -0.47 and 0.74, all P values less than or equal to .03). Simple machine learning models were shown to be useful in predicting the change in anxiety and depression scores (mean squared error ranging between 2.37 and 4.22, R2 ranging between 0.68 and 0.84) with the proposed features. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions have strong correlations with behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite all studies that have described the imaging findings of SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia, pathologic studies remain scarce, and adequate correlation of pathology with imaging features are occasionally reported.Methods: This unicentric retrospective observational study included 46 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent minimally invasive autopsy (MIA). Autopsy was performed prospectively in consecutive patients, while imaging analysis was retrospective, using exams of the clinical routine. All images available were reviewed and classified for the presence and grade of viral pneumonia, as well as disease evolution on imaging. On CT exams, phenotypes were described as consistent with mild, moderate, or severe viral pneumonia, with or without radiological signs of organizing pneumonia(OP). In cases of severe pneumonia, when appropriate, CT phenotype could be classified as a diffuse form of OP or diffuse alveolar damage(DAD).Findings: Only three patients(7%) showed no pulmonary opacities on admission CXR, while 33 patients(72%) presented CXR findings consistent with moderate or severe viral pneumonia. Interestingly, most patients showed stability or improvement (reduction of opacities) on imaging during hospitalization, before death. Consolidations on CT, performed on 15 patients, were found in most patients (87%), more frequently showing features consistent with OP than signs of radiological DAD. Radiological signs of fibro-reparation were also prevalent on CT images. These findings correlate with histopathological features of organizing plugs and/or fibrin balls(87%), indicating OP and/or acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia(AFOP). Also, in the CT exams, interstitial fibrosis was the most prevalent pathological feature and was described as a nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)-simile pattern.Interpretation: The role of imaging as a potential prediction tool of evolution to pulmonary fibrosis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is yet to be established. In this study, a correlation was shown between imaging findings and MIA pathological patterns of lung disease. Signs of organization and fibrosis were prevalent on both imaging and pathology and, differently from what has been described in the majority of previous studies, DAD was not the most important radio-pathological pattern in this study. Based on these findings, authors believe that the report of radiological signs of organization on CT, in the form of OP foci, as a diffuse form of OP or radiological DAD is likely as important as, or even more important than the description and quantification of the burden of opacities. Furthermore, it would be crucial to identify and describe the fibro-reparative radiological signs. This imaging phenotyping, which correlates with the pathological findings, might indicate a higher probability of developing post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis and other complications.Funding: No external funding support.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: This study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee and written informed consent for the use of radiological imaging exams and MIA results was waived.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia Phenotyping on Imaging: Correlation with Minimally Invasive Autopsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a report of a novel coronaviruses which called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from Wuhan, China shocked the world.

We observe that physics constrains decomposition as well as shape in occluded regions and hypothesise that a latent space learned from scenes built under physics simulation can serve as a prior to better predict shape and instances in occluded regions. To this end we propose SIMstack, a depth-conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), trained on a dataset of objects stacked under physics simulation. We formulate instance segmentation as a centre voting task which allows for class-agnostic detection and doesn't require setting the maximum number of objects in the scene.

The virus has already infected more than 44 M people and the number of deaths reported has reached more than 1.1 M which may be attributed to lack of medicine. The traditional drug discovery approach involves many years of rigorous research and development and demands for a huge investment which cannot be adopted for the ongoing pandemic infection. Rather we need a swift and cost-effective approach to inhibit and control the viral infection. With the help of computational screening approaches and by choosing appropriate chemical space, it is possible to identify lead drug-like compounds for Covid-19. In this study, we have used the Drugbank database to screen compounds against the most important viral targets namely 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the spike (S) protein. These targets play a major role in the replication/transcription and host cell recognition, therefore, are vital for the viral reproduction and spread of infection. As the structure based computational screening approaches are more reliable, we used the crystal structures for 3C-like main protease and spike protein. For the remaining targets, we used the structures based on homology modeling. Further, we employed two scoring methods based on binding free energies implemented in AutoDock Vina and molecular mechanicsgeneralized Born surface area approach. Based on these results, we propose drug cocktails active against the three viral targets namely 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp. Interestingly, one of the identified compounds in this study i.e. Baloxavir marboxil has been under clinical trial for the treatment of Covid-19 infection. In addition, we have identified a few compounds such as Phthalocyanine, Tadalafil, Lonafarnib, Nilotinib, Dihydroergotamine, R-428 which can bind to all three targets simultaneously and can serve as multi-targeting drugs.

The antiviral effect of GRFT was evaluated in vitro using the HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) and HCV cell culture (HCVcc) systems. We show here that preincubation of HCVpp and HCVcc with GRFT prevents infection of Huh-7 hepatoma cells. Furthermore, GRFT interferes with direct cell-to-cell transmission of HCV. GRFT acts at an early phase of the viral life cycle by interfering in a genotype-independent fashion with the interaction between the viral envelope proteins and the viral receptor CD81. The capacity of GRFT to prevent infection in vivo was evaluated using uPA(+/+)-SCID mice (uPA stands for urokinase-type plasminogen activator) that harbor human primary hepatocytes in their liver (chimeric mice). In this proof-of-concept trial, we demonstrated that GRFT can mitigate HCV infection of chimeric mice. Treated animals that did become infected demonstrated a considerable delay in the kinetics of the viral infection. Our data demonstrate that GRFT can prevent HCV infection in vitro and mitigate HCV infection in vivo. GRFT treatment of chronically infected HCV patients undergoing liver transplantation may be a suitable strategy to prevent infection of the liver allograft.","output":"Griffithsin has antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, investors need to see and assess the level of risk to determine investment decisions.

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) perform viral genome duplication and RNA synthesis. Therefore, we compared the available RdRp sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates and Wuhan wet sea food market virus sequence to identify, if any, variation between them. We report seven mutations observed in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and three unique mutations that showed changes in the secondary structure of the RdRp protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that these mutations alter the stability of RdRp protein.

Here, a successful approach to control the spread of COVID-19 transmission is described by the engagement of public (university and governance) and private sectors (hospitals and oil companies) in Maca, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a city known as the National Oil Capital. In 2020 between the 17th and 38th epidemiological week, over two percent of the 206,728 citizens were subjected to symptom analysis and RT-qPCR testing by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, with positive individuals being notified up to 48 h after swab collection. Geocodification and spatial cluster analysis were used to limit COVID-19 spreading in Maca. Within the first semester after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil, Maca recorded 1.8% of fatalities associated with COVID-19 up to the 38th epidemiological week, which was at least five times lower than the state capital (10.6%). Overall, considering the successful experience of this joint effort of private and public engagement in Maca, our data suggest that the development of a similar strategy countrywise could have contributed to a better control of the COVID-19 spread in Brazil.

The professional culture of the house of medicine not only mimics society in attributing stigma to people with mental health issues but may also contribute to high rates of suicide in the ranks of health care professionals by leading to a delay in seeking treatment. Acculturation accelerates in the first year of medical school such that medical students experience an increase in burnout and depressive symptoms from prematriculation levels. It follows that faculty have a responsibility to improve the learning environment. Survey data from medical faculty at the authors institution showed that depression decreased respondents willingness to seek mental health treatment because of the stigma and issues of access to help. Faculty attitudes toward mental health issues, including reluctance to admit having such issues, may be conveyed to medical students in the hidden curriculum that teaches them to keep depression hidden. Moreover, the fear of mental disorders is manifested in licensing and privileging applications under the guise of patient safety, contributing to a culture of shame and silence. As creators and guardians of this professional culture, medical faculty and other physicians must be the ones who change it. The same faculty who play a part in causing and perpetuating stigma related to mental health issues have the power to derive and enact some of the solutions. In addition to giving voice to a personal experience of mental health issues, this article offers suggestions for normalizing moderate to severe depression as a medical disorder, decreasing the stigma of mental health issues, and encouraging faculty to seek treatment.","output":"Professional Stigma of Mental Health Issues: Physicians Are Both the Cause and Solution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The use of checkpoint blockade therapy (CBT) has shown impressive results for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). The impact of CBT depends on the reversal of an exhausted T-cell immune phenotype and a consequential increase in the immunological, anti-tumor effect derived from a patient's adaptive immunity. As most patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma will relapse during or after this treatment, clinicians often provide consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is fit patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for CBT efficacy can also be those that increase the risk of immunological complications after alloHCT. AREAS COVERED: We carried out in-depth research on current medical literature to report and discuss the mechanism of action of CBT within a cHL setting; clinical results of CBT in cHL setting pre-alloHCT and post-alloHCT; interactions between CBT and alloHCT; and further clinical considerations. EXPERT OPINION: Checkpoint blockade therapy is an effective strategy for relapsed/refractory cHL. Its use is associated with higher immunological toxicities when administered before or after alloHCT. Whenever alloHCT is planned, clinicians should follow international recommendations such as using post-transplant cyclophosphamide GVHD prophylaxis.","output":"Synchronizing the Use of Allogeneic HCT in the Era of Checkpoint Blockade Therapy in the Management of Hodgkin Lymphoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like most countries globally, COVID-19 continues to have a demonstrable health, economic, and environmental impact on Russia The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible ramifications for environmental quality in Russia during and following the coronavirus pandemic Our work builds on the framework of Elinor Ostrom, as we argue that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown in Russia has highlighted the need for a more polycentric, de-centralized approach to environmental protection We provide evidence for this point using a novel econometric strategy: given the tight centralization of environmental policymaking, we proxy for de facto decentralization using the amount of influence a regional governor has at the federal level Using timely data on pollution in major Russian cities both before and during the pandemic, we employ an instrumental variable analysis which shows that pollution in a particular Russian region is negatively related to the amount of influence a Russian governor has at the federal level Thus, the more powerful a governor is in their ability to set their own course, the better results they have in environmental quality We conclude that Russia's environmental policy needs a fundamental rethink C and extensive decentralization C in a post-COVID-19 world ?

In particular, aged individuals and individuals with comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, have significantly higher risks of hospitalization and death than normal individuals. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), belonging to the RAS family, has received much attention during this COVID-19 pandemic, owing to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry. Additionally, the RAS greatly affects energy metabolism in certain pathological conditions, including cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, and viral infections. This article discusses the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates the RAS and energy metabolism in individuals with obesity and diabetes mellitus. The article aims to highlight the appropriate strategies for combating the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical setting and emphasize on the areas that require further investigation in relation to COVID-19 infections in patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus from the viewpoint of endocrinology and metabolism.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 perturbs the renin-angiotensin system and energy metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, to get a better understanding in characterizing groundwater and ensure its effective management, the radon concentrations in water samples were measured through Ryukyu limestone in southern Okinawa Island, Japan.

The radon concentrations in the samples from the Gyokusendo cave, and Ukinju and Komesu springs were 10  1.3 Bq L-1, 3.2  1.0 Bq L-1, and 3.1  1.1 Bq L-1, respectively. The radon concentrations showed a gradually increasing trend from summer to autumn and decreased during winter. The variation of radon concentrations in the dripping water sample from the Gyokusendo cave showed a lagged response to precipitation changes by approximately 2-3 months. The estimated radon concentrations in the dripping water sample were calculated with the measured radon concentrations from the dripping water obtained during the study period. Based on our results, groundwater in the Gyokusendo cave system was estimated to percolate through the Ryukyu limestone in 7-10 days, and the residence time of groundwater in the soil above Gyokusendo cave was estimated to be approximately 50-80 days.

In this paper, using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework, we examine differences in time spent in major activities between individuals who worked from home and away from home. We use data on prime working-age adults (age 25-54 years old) who participated in the 2017-18 Leave and Job Flexibilities Module of the American Time Use Survey. Results show that prime working-age American adults who worked from home during their diary day spent less time working and on personal care, but more time on leisure, sleeping, and on food production and consumption than those who worked away from home. For instance, among individuals with a spouse or partner present, those who worked from home spent 25 more minutes engaged in food production and 48 more minutes eating and drinking at home than did individuals who worked away from home, which are large relative to the sample averages of 33 and 31 min, respectively. These results show that there is important variation in the daily time allocation of workers in their prime working years and suggest in particular that working from home may allow for substantially more time to produce food and consume food at home, which may provide teleworkers with health benefits since home-produced meals tend to be lower in calories and higher in nutrients than meals prepared away from home.","output":"The effect of working from home on major time allocations with a focus on food-related activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preterm infants with antenatal absent or reversed end diastolic flow (AREDF) in umbilical arteries are at major risk for gastrointestinal (GI) complications, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal perforation and feeding intolerance.

Covid-19 may cause fatality especially among elderly, and people with chronic health problems. After human to human transmissions of the disease, it has rapidly spread throughout China, and then the outbreak has reached to neighboring countries in Asia. Now, the spread of the virus is accelerating in the world, and increasing number of new cases has been reported daily in Europe, Middle East, Africa and America regions. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) also announced Covid-19 as a Pandemic. As of 3 April, worldwide around more than 1 million cases and around 60,000 fatalities are reported. Thus, forecasting regional and worldwide outbreak size of Covid-19 is important in order to take necessary actions regarding to preparedness plans and mitigation interventions. In this work, we design a deep learning model, which is an effective artificial intelligence method, to provide regional and worldwide forecasts. Particularly for worldwide, our approach predicts the cumulative number of cases, cumulative number of deaths and daily new cases. For Europe and Middle East regions, we predict the cumulative number of cases, and for Mainland China we predict daily new cases and the cumulative number of deaths. We predict the next 10 days based on the previously reported actual time series data of Covid-19. For worldwide forecasts, we use the data provided by Worldometers. For Europe and Middle East forecasts, we use the data provided by World Health Organization, and for China Mainland forecasts, the data is obtained from Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that a deep learning model has been employed for Covid-19 spread prediction, solely based on the known reported cases of Covid-19. The proposed deep learning architecture consists of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layers to predict regional and worldwide forecasts. We evaluate our approach with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. For forecasting, we use the network models that give the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days of actual data. Networks, which achieves the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days, are used to predict the next 10 days. Every day, the spread and situations are changing. Our approach can take into account these real-time changes; the deep learning model can be re-trained with new daily data and perform real-time forecasting. Results show that the proposed deep learning model is promising, it can predict possible scenarios regionally and globally for the spread of Covid-19.","output":"Worldwide and Regional Forecasting of Coronavirus (Covid-19) Spread using a Deep Learning Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, including Kawasaki disease (KD), emerged during COVID-19 pandemic. We explored whether Kawasaki-like disease (KD), when associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, has specific characteristics. METHODS: We included children and adolescents with KD criteria admitted in the department of general pediatrics of a university hospital in Paris, France, between January 1, 2018, and May 26, 2020. The incidence of KD was compared between the outbreak and a pre-outbreak control period (January 1, 2018, to April 25). Characteristics of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing (KD-SARS-CoV-2) were compared to those of the pre-outbreak period (classic KD). RESULTS: A total of 30 and 59 children with KD were admitted during the outbreak and pre-outbreak periods, respectively (incidence ratio 13.2 [8.3C21.0]). During the outbreak, 23/30 (77%) children were diagnosed as KD-SARS-CoV-2. When compared with patients with classic KD, those with KD-SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently of sub-Saharan African ancestry (OR 4.4 [1.6C12.6]) and older (median 8.2 vs. 4.0 years, p < 0.001), had more often initial gastrointestinal (OR 84 [4.9C1456]) and neurological (OR 7.3 [1.9C27.7] manifestations, and shock syndrome (OR 13.7 [4.2C45.1]). They had significantly higher CRP and ferritin levels. Noticeably, they had more frequently myocarditis (OR 387 [38C3933]).

This study aimed to describe two clinical case reports of patients with no prior history of psychiatric illnesses admitted to the psychiatric inpatient unit with acute onset of psychosis. A 49-year-old woman with no past medical history and no past psychiatric history was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit with suicidal ideation and was noted to have acute psychosis. A 56-year-old woman with a history of hypertension with no past psychiatric history was admitted to the hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia and was noted to have acute psychosis.

However, the pathophysiology, direct biological effects of the disease, treatment modalities, worsening of symptoms due to various medications, and other long-term sequelae are not fully understood. Therefore, clinicians should be mindful of neuropsychiatric symptoms and conduct a detailed history and physical examination on all patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms in the context of COVID-19. It is also essential to assess for signs and symptoms of delirium in patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1-dependent manner by an unconventional route. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA and is responsible for the cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate cells, NS1 associates with and relies on the CCC for secretion. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors, such as brefeldin A, Golgicide A, and Fli-06, showed no effect on NS1 secretion but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV-1 or FKBP52 with short interfering RNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion, again without affecting virion release. Colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays indicated that NS1 colocalizes and interacts with all proteins of the CCC. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV-infected cells. Results obtained with Zika virus-infected cells suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway as that observed for DENV NS1. These results uncover important differences in the dengue virus-cell interactions between the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector as well as novel functions for the chaperone caveolin complex.IMPORTANCE The dengue virus protein NS1 is secreted efficiently from both infected vertebrate and mosquito cells. Previously, our group reported that NS1 secretion in mosquito cells follows an unconventional secretion pathway dependent on caveolin-1. In this work, we demonstrate that in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate cells, NS1 secretion takes place in association with the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, CyA, and Cy40, which are in charge of cholesterol transport inside the cell. Results obtained with ZIKV-infected mosquito cells suggest that ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. These results uncover important differences in the virus-cell interactions between the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector, as well as novel functions for the chaperone caveolin complex. Moreover, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy to combat these two mosquito-borne diseases.","output":"The Dengue Virus Nonstructural Protein 1 (NS1) Is Secreted from Mosquito Cells in Association with the Intracellular Cholesterol Transporter Chaperone Caveolin Complex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Due to global trade and transportation, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly reached all corners of the world;it has most impacted the poor communities and rural areas with limited or no access to recovery. This paper aims to understand the pandemic's impact on the market supply of vegetables (agrifood) in Ethiopia and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and to implement scientifically based recommendations that can improve the challenges caused by the pandemic and improve the livelihoods of vegetable producers. Design/methodology/approach This study assessed the major incidents that follow the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia with the factors that significantly influence onion market supply in the Mecha district of Northwestern Ethiopia using linear multiple regression. Findings The study revealed that producers, processors, local collectors, cooperatives, wholesalers, retailers and consumers are the main actors. The most important difference that happened on the onion market channel after the outbreak of coronavirus was brokers were removed from the market channel after the pandemic and this saved the cost producers pay as a commission. The pandemic disrupted input distribution, extension and cooperative services and created labor scarcity. Access to market, postharvest value addition, price and marketing contract were significant factors that influence the market supply of onion. The study identified the need for policy interventions by the government to overcome the postpandemic challenges and ensure the sustainable development of onion production and marketing in the Mecha district. Research limitations/implications The limitations of the study are primarily related to the methodology as data are collected at a single moment in time.

Digital mental health (DMH), the use of technologies to deliver services, have been touted as a way to expand access to care and reduce disparities. However, many DMH fail to mitigate the persistent disparities associated with structural racism that impact delivery (e.g., costs, dependable internet access)Cand may even exacerbate them. Human-centered design (HCD) may be uniquely poised to design and test interventions alongside, rather than for, marginalized individuals. In employing HCD methodologies, developers may proceed with a vested interest in understanding and establishing empathy with users and their needs, behaviors, environments, and constraints. As such, HCD used to mindfully address structural racism in behavioral health care may address shortcomings of prior interventions that have neglected to elevate the voices of marginalized individuals. We argue that a paradigm shift in behavioral health services research is critically neededCone that embraces HCD as a key methodological framework for developing and evaluating interventions with marginalized communities, to ultimately promote more accessible, useful, and equitable care. The current commentary illustrates practical examples of the use of HCD methodologies to develop and evaluate DMH designed with marginalized populations, while also highlighting its limitations and need for even greater inclusivity. Following this, calls to action to learn from and improve upon HCD methodologies will be detailed. Acknowledging potential limitations of current design practices, methodologies must ultimately engage representative voices beyond research participation and invest in their active role as compensated and true collaborators to intervention design.","output":"A Call to Action: Using and Extending Human-Centered Design Methodologies to Improve Mental and Behavioral Health Equity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increase in peoples use of mobile messaging services has led to the spread of social engineering attacks like phishing, considering that spam text is one of the main factors in the dissemination of phishing attacks to steal sensitive data such as credit cards and passwords. In addition, rumors and incorrect medical information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic are widely shared on social media leading to peoples fear and confusion. Thus, filtering spam content is vital to reduce risks and threats. Previous studies relied on machine learning and deep learning approaches for spam classification, but these approaches have two limitations. Machine learning models require manual feature engineering, whereas deep neural networks require a high computational cost. This paper introduces a dynamic deep ensemble model for spam detection that adjusts its complexity and extracts features automatically. The proposed model utilizes convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction along with base classifiers such as random forests and extremely randomized trees for classifying texts into spam or legitimate ones. Moreover, the model employs ensemble learning procedures like boosting and bagging. As a result, the model achieved high precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy of 98.38%.","output":"Deep convolutional forest: a dynamic deep ensemble approach for spam detection in text"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Karnataka imposed weeknight and weekend curfews to mitigate the spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.

The simulation outcomes suggest that Omicron eventually spreads and affects nearly as much of the population as it would have without the restrictions. Further, if Karnataka cases trajectory follows the South African Omicron wave trend and the hospitalisation is similar to that observed in well-vaccinated countries (2% of the confirmed cases), then the healthcare requirement is likely within the capacity of Bengaluru Urban when the caseload peaks, with or without the mobility restrictions.

More than half of critically ill patients may experience cognitive impairment after hospital discharge. There is limited information on cognitive impairment surrounding PICS in COVID-19 survivors. This study aims to evaluate the impact anticholinergic cognitive burden has on cognitive function in the COVID-19 survivor patient population. METHODS: This retrospective, observational cohort study included patients from the post-intensive care survivor clinic at Indiana University Health that were discharged from April 2020 to March 2021. Patients were excluded if they did not have an admitting diagnosis of respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 or did not have discharge documentation. Cognitive impairment was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographics and anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scores were compared between patients with cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26) versus those without cognitive impairment (MoCA > 26). RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in this evaluation. Twelve patients had cognitive impairment and fourteen patients did not have cognitive impairment. ACB score at discharge for those with and without cognitive impairment had a median (IQR) score of 2.5 (0.75-4.25) and 1 (0.25-2), respectively (p=0.208). The patients with cognitive impairment had a median (IQR) ACB score at the start and end of the initial appointment of 1.5 (0.75-2.5) and 1.5 (0.75-2.25), respectively. The median (IQR) ACB score at the start and end of the initial appointment for patients without cognitive impairment was 1 (0-1.75). Delirium was reported 7 patients (58%) with cognitive impairment compared to 5 patients (36%) without cognitive impairment (p=0.431). The Charlston comorbidity score was higher in those with cognitive impairment, with a median (IQR) score of 3.5 (2.75-5) compared to 0 (0-2) for those without cognitive impairment (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in ACB scores at discharge was not statistically different between patients with and without cognitive impairment.

Compared with people without HIV, people with HIV (PWH) could be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or experience worse COVID-19-related clinical outcomes. New York City (NYC) has been hard-hit by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and is also home to a large population of PWH.Methods: We matched lab-confirmed COVID-19 case and death data reported to the NYC Health Department as of June 2, 2020, against the NYC HIV surveillance registry. We describe and compare the characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes of PWH diagnosed with COVID-19 to all NYC PWH and to all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19.Findings: Through June 2, 204,583 NYC COVID-19 cases were reported. The registry match identified 2,410 PWH with diagnosed COVID-19 eligible for analysis (1.2% of all COVID-19 cases). Compared with all NYC PWH and all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 were older, male, Black or Latino/Hispanic, and living in high-poverty neighborhoods. At least one non-immunodeficiency-related underlying condition was reported for 58.9% of PWH with COVID-19. Compared with all NYC COVID-19 cases, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 experienced COVID-19-related hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death during this period. Most PWH with COVID-19 were HIV virally suppressed.Interpretation: New Yorkers with HIV comprised 1.2% of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases. This aligns with the general prevalence of HIV in NYC (1.5%), suggesting that PWH are not overrepresented among COVID-19 cases. However, compared with NYC COVID-19 cases overall, PWH experienced worse COVID-19-related outcomes.

Here we aimed at analysing the role of CD81 in Herpes simplex virus 1 infectivity using a neuroblastoma cell model. For this purpose, we generated a CD81 KO cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Despite being CD81 a plasma membrane protein, CD81 KO cells showed no defects in viral entry nor in the expression of early protein markers. In contrast, glycoprotein B and C, which require viral DNA replication for their expression, were significantly reduced in CD81 KO infected cells. Indeed, HSV-1 DNA replication and the formation of new infectious particles were severely compromised in CD81 KO cells. We could not detect significant changes in SAMHD1 total expression levels, but a relocalization into endosomal structures was observed in CD81 KO cells. In summary, CD81 KO cells showed impaired viral DNA replication and produced greatly diminished viral titers.","output":"Tetraspanin CD81 regulates HSV-1 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dunia saat ini sedang dilanda pandemi COVID-19 atau dikenal dengan Coronavirus 2019.

Viruses giving rise to the different 501Y lineages have, presumably under intense natural selection following a shift in host environment, independently acquired multiple unique and convergent mutations. As a consequence, all have gained epidemiological and immunological properties that will likely complicate the control of COVID-19. Here, by examining patterns of mutations that arose in SARSCoV-2 genomes during the pandemic we find evidence of a major change in the selective forces acting on various SARS-CoV-2 genes and gene segments (such as S, nsp2 and nsp6), that likely coincided with the emergence of the 501Y lineages. In addition to involving continuing sequence diversification, we find evidence that a significant portion of the ongoing adaptive evolution of the 501Y lineages also involves further convergence between the lineages. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring how members of these known 501Y lineages, and others still undiscovered, are convergently evolving similar strategies to ensure their persistence in the face of mounting infection and vaccine induced host immune recognition.","output":"The emergence and ongoing convergent evolution of the N501Y lineages coincides with a major global shift in the SARS-CoV-2 selective landscape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this issue, Fisher and colleagues report the results of a nationally representative U.S. survey that found that only approximately 6 in 10 respondents said that they will get vaccinated when a vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 becomes available.

Clinical evaluations of spasticity (Ashworth scale), manual muscle testing (Lovett scale), and surface electromyography recordings at rest (rEMG) and during attempts of maximal muscle contraction (mcEMG) were performed three times in 120 post-stroke patients (T0: up to 7 days after the incidence; T1: after 21 days of treatment; T2: after 60 days of treatment). Patients (N = 120) were divided into two subgroups60 patients received personalized NMFES and PNF treatment (NMFES+K), and the other 60 received only PNF (K). The NMFES+K therapy resulted in a decrease in spasticity and an increase in muscle strength of mainly flexor muscles, in comparison with the K group. A positive correlation between the increase of rEMG amplitudes and high Ashworth scale scores and a positive correlation between low amplitudes of mcEMG and low Lovett scale scores were found in the wrist flexors and calf muscles on the paretic side. Negative correlations were found between the rEMG and mcEMG amplitudes in the recordings. The five-grade alternate activity score of the antagonists actions improved in the NMFES+K group. These improvements in the results of controlled NMFES treatment combined with PNF in patients having experienced an ischemic stroke, in comparison to the use of kinesiotherapy alone, might justify the application of conjoined rehabilitation procedures based on neurophysiological approaches. Considering the results of clinical and neurophysiological studies, we suppose that NMFES of the antagonistic muscle groups acting at the wrist and the ankle may evoke its positive effects in post-stroke patients by the modulation of the activity more in the spinal motor centers, including the level of Ia inhibitory neurons, than only at the muscular level.","output":"Post-Stroke Treatment with Neuromuscular Functional Electrostimulation of Antagonistic Muscles and Kinesiotherapy Evaluated with Electromyography and Clinical Studies in a Two-Month Follow-Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient Portal represents a connecting service for the Slovenian eHealth solutions and enables patients with effective and secure access to their medical documentation.

Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from including hydrogel dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of hydrogel wound dressings compared with alternative dressings or none on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH METHODS For this first update, in April 2013, we searched the following databases the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared the effects on ulcer healing of hydrogel with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included five studies (446 participants) in this review. Meta analysis of three studies comparing hydrogel dressings with basic wound contract dressings found significantly greater healing with hydrogel: risk ratio (RR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 2.56. The three pooled studies had different follow-up times (12 weeks, 16 weeks and 20 weeks) and also evaluated ulcers of different severities (grade 3 and 4; grade 2 and grade unspecified). One study compared a hydrogel dressing with larval therapy and found no statistically significant difference in the number of ulcers healed and another found no statistically significant difference in healing between hydrogel and platelet-derived growth factor. There was also no statistically significant difference in number of healed ulcers between two different brands of hydrogel dressing. All included studies were small and at unclear risk of bias and there was some clinical heterogeneity with studies including different ulcer grades. No included studies compared hydrogel with other advanced wound dressings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence to suggest that hydrogel dressings are more effective in healing (lower grade) diabetic foot ulcers than basic wound contact dressings however this finding is uncertain due to risk of bias in the original studies. There is currently no research evidence to suggest that hydrogel is more effective than larval therapy or platelet-derived growth factors in healing diabetic foot ulcers, nor that one brand of hydrogel is more effective than another in ulcer healing.

In this paper, we are addressing the issue of spreading public concern about epidemics. Public concern about a communicable disease can be seen as a problem of its own. Keeping track of trends in concern about public health and identifying peaks of public concern are therefore crucial tasks. However, monitoring public health concerns is not only expensive with traditional surveillance systems, but also suffers from limited coverage and significant delays. To address these problems, we are using Twitter messages, which are available free of cost, are generated world-wide, and are posted in real time. We are measuring public concern using a two-step sentiment classification approach. In the first step, we distinguish Personal tweets from News (i.e., Non-Personal) tweets. In the second step, we further separate Personal Negative from Personal Non-Negative tweets. Both these steps consist themselves of two sub-steps. In the first sub-step (of both steps), our programs automatically generate training data using an emotion-oriented, clue-based method. In the second sub-step, we are training and testing three different Machine Learning (ML) models with the training data from the first sub-step; this allows us to determine the best ML model for different datasets. Furthermore, we are testing the already trained ML models with a human annotated, disjoint dataset. Based on the number of tweets classified as Personal Negative, we compute a Measure of Concern (MOC) and a timeline of the MOC. We attempt to correlate peaks of the MOC timeline to peaks of the News (Non-Personal) timeline.

Pyeongtaek St. Mary Hospital, where a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) index patient infected several patients on the same floor, was used for a case study. We compared the dispersion characteristics of various particle sizes and validated results by comparing infection rates in different ward. Results indicated that droplets spread across the corridor and dispersed to wards that were more than 17 m apart from the index patient by natural ventilation. Droplets from exhaled breath under steady-state simulation showed a wider range of dispersion than cough droplets under transient simulation, but cough droplet dispersion was more consistent with the actual infection rate in each ward. Cough droplets sized under 75 m evaporated to 26% of the initial size and started to disperse into the corridor within one minute; in nine minutes, droplets dispersed throughout every ward.

Because of a decreased affinity for the ACE-2 receptor and a geometric reorganization of the S1-S2 cleavage site, the Omicron variant is predicted to not have a significant infectivity advantage over the delta variant and to be less pathogenic than Delta. However, in Omicron, neutralizing epitopes are greatly affected, suggesting that current vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies might confer reduced protection against this variant. In contrast, we and others previously demonstrated that polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD obtained from hyperimmunized animal hosts do maintain their neutralizing properties against Alpha to Delta.

Factors involved in the vulnerability to stressful events have been under-investigated in this population. We aimed to assess which factors contributed to COVID-19-induced worsening in both general and specific psychopathology. Methods: Three-hundred and twelve people with a clinically defined diagnosis of an ED and undergoing a specialist ED treatment in different Italian ED services before the spreading of COVID-19 pandemic filled in an online survey. ED specific and general psychopathology changes after COVID-19 quarantine were retrospectively evaluated. Factors related to COVID-19 concerns (financial condition, fear of contagion, perceived social isolation/support, satisfaction in peer, family or sentimental relationships), illness duration and treatment-related variables (type of treatment provided, type of access to care, satisfaction with therapeutic relationships) were included as predicting factors in a structural equational model, which included latent variables consisting of general and ED psychopathology items as outcomes. Results: A perceived low quality of therapeutic relationships, fear of contagion and increased isolation were positively associated with psychopathology worsening. Reduced satisfaction with family and with friends' relationships and reduced perceived social support were associated with ED and general symptoms deterioration, respectively. No significant effect emerged for intimate relationships, illness duration, economic condition and type of treatment.

Organ dysfunction scores can serve this essential role, but their evaluation in this context has been limited so far. In this study, we sought to assess the performance of three organ dysfunction scores in both critically ill adults and children at clinically relevant mortality thresholds and timeframes for resource allocation and compare it with two published prioritization schemas. DESIGN Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING Three large academic medical centers in the United States. PATIENTS Critically ill adults and children. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We calculated the daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in adults and the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 score and the Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in children. There were 49,290 (11.6% mortality) and 19,983 children (2.5% mortality) included in the analysis. Both the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores had adequate discrimination across relevant timeframes and adequate distribution across relevant mortality thresholds. Additionally, we found that the only published state prioritization schema that includes pediatric and adult patients had poor alignment of mortality risks, giving adults a systematic advantage over children. CONCLUSIONS In the largest analysis of organ dysfunction scores in a general population of critically ill adults and children to date, we found that both the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores had adequate performance across relevant mortality thresholds and timeframes for resource allocation. Published prioritization schemas that include both pediatric and adult patients may put children at a disadvantage. Furthermore, the distribution of patient and mortality risk in the published schemas may not adequately stratify patients for some high-stakes allocation decisions. This information may be useful to bioethicists, healthcare leaders, and policy makers who are developing resource allocation policies for critically ill patients.","output":"Evaluation of Organ Dysfunction Scores for Allocation of Scarce Resources in Critically Ill Children and Adults During a Healthcare Crisis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Notre h?pital a pris en charge ds janvier 2020 des patients infects par le SARS-CoV-2 et organis une prise en charge (PEC) des cas possibles en ambulatoire Nous rapportons ici lorganisation paramdicale, centre sur le principe de la supervision Matriels et mthodes Trois patients ont t hospitaliss en maladies infectieuses (SMIT) et 1 en ranimation mdicale Un patient du SMIT a t secondairement transfr en ranimation Au SMIT les patients sont dans lunit de risque pidmique et biologique (REB) dans des chambres  pression ngative avec sas et, en ranimation dans une partie cloisonne, avec pression ngative ou traitement dair mobile La supervision a t dveloppe en 2014 avec les alertes Ebola, elle consiste  former les cadres des 3 services concerns (EOH, SMIT, ranimation) pour : anticiper larrive des cas, vrifier lhabillage et le dshabillage, suivre la PEC et les examens biologiques, veiller  lorganisation logistique, transport des patientsLes alertes Ebola puis MERS-CoV, avec une vingtaine de patients admis par an, ont permis damliorer la supervision Lensemble des services de 1re ligne (SMIT, SAU et ranimation) est rgulirement form aux mesures de prvention Des exercices avec le SMIT, la ranimation et le SAMU ont t organiss pour tester les circuits et les procdures Rsultats En situation de crise, un superviseur est mobilisable 24h/24 Il accompagne les quipes dans la PEC des patients, de laccueil  la sortie ou dcs Il sassure du bon fonctionnement des circuits logistiques, de la mise  disposition du matriel et de la gestion des stocks Il coordonne et accompagne la ralisation des examens hors du service (5 scanners pour le SARS-CoV-2) en collaboration avec les services de brancardage et de scurit Il encadre les visites auprs des patients infects Il participe aussi  linformation des services de 2e ligne Cette organisation est trs rassurante pour les quipes soignantes, le superviseur servant de ? tour de contr?le ? du dispositif, et assurant la liaison oprationnelle entre tous les partenaires Comme pour les autres acteurs impliqus dans cette pidmie, se pose la question de la prennit de cette organisation en situation de crise prolonge, compte tenu de la charge technique et psychologique quil supporte Conclusion Les organisations de PEC des patients REB sont variables dun tablissement  lautre La supervision, mene par un cadre qui ma?trise les procdures REB, semble tre de nature  assurer la scurit et la coordination entre tous les partenaires pour une prise en charge optimale des patients et la protection des personnels","output":"La supervision, un lment central pour la scurisation de la prise en charge des patients infects par le SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The subject of the current study is the process of implementing the social housing policy and its impact on increasing the quality of life (QOL) of vulnerable people.

Within the spectrum of observed thrombotic events, pulmonary embolism seems to prevail. These trends are concerning and reinforce current recommendations on anticoagulation in critically ill with the virus. To illustrate the variety of possible presentations of pulmonary emboli in COVID-19 population, two cases of patients in their sixties are described, one without any predisposing risk factors and one with history of asthma and obesity. These patients developed pulmonary emboli at different points during their hospital course, were treated differently, and had different outcomes. Important observations are made that may shed some light on possible etiology of pulmonary emboli. One of the patients presented still developed pulmonary embolism despite being on full dose anticoagulation. Literature review suggests that pulmonary clot burden in COVID-19 patients could be due to pulmonary thrombus rather than pulmonary embolism and is triggered by profuse vascular damage and severe inflammatory response.

National biosecurity standards have been developed for Canadian mink farms, but it is unclear how well these standards have been implemented as there are no studies correlating management practices of mink producers with causes of death in mink kits. To that end, we surveyed Ontario mink producers on their biosecurity and management practices and conducted almost 5660 post mortem examinations on found-dead, preweaned kits to characterize mink farm biosecurity practices and causes of death in preweaned kits. RESULTS: We found that very few biosecurity and management practices were uniformly used by producers, despite good awareness of appropriate practices. Use of personal protective equipment was implemented by fewer than 50% of respondents, while control of mink shed access, disinfection of feed containers after use, and use of a rodent control program were the only practices implemented by greater than 70% of respondents. Only 18% of producers reported regular use of antimicrobials in feed or water, although 91% stated they used antimicrobials for treatment of bacterial diseases on a regular basis. On post mortem examination, no gross abnormalities were noted in 71% of the kits, 45% were thought to be stillborn or aborted, 27% had some form of abnormal fluid distribution in the body, and 2% had a congenital malformation. A subset of 69 gastrointestinal tract samples was submitted for bacterial culture, of which 45 samples yielded sufficient growth. Most interesting was the identification of Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg in 11% of samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will provide a benchmark for Canadian mink producers and their veterinarians, defining the areas to which greater attention should be given to ensure more rigorous biosecurity practices are in place. Ultimately, these improvements in practices may contribute to increased mink production and animal well-being.

A major step in control of viral gene expression is the regulation of sgRNA synthesis by specific promoter elements. We used barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) as a model system to study transcriptional control in a virus with multiple sgRNAs. BYDV generates three sgRNAs during infection. The sgRNA1 promoter has been mapped previously to a 98-nucleotide (nt) region which forms two stem-loop structures. It was determined that sgRNA1 is not required for BYDV RNA replication in oat protoplasts. In this study, we show that neither sgRNA2 nor sgRNA3 is required for BYDV RNA replication. The promoters for sgRNA2 and sgRNA3 synthesis were mapped by using deletion mutagenesis. The minimal sgRNA2 promoter is approximately 143 nt long (nt 4810 to 4952) and is located immediately downstream of the putative sgRNA2 start site (nt 4809). The minimal sgRNA3 core promoter is 44 nt long (nt 5345 to 5388), with most of the sequence located downstream of sgRNA3 start site (nt 5348). For both promoters, additional sequences upstream of the start site enhanced sgRNA promoter activity. These promoters contrast to the sgRNA1 promoter, in which almost all of the promoter is located upstream of the transcription initiation site. Comparison of RNA sequences and computer-predicted secondary structures revealed little or no homology between the three sgRNA promoter elements. Thus, a small RNA virus with multiple sgRNAs can have very different subgenomic promoters, which implies a complex system for promoter recognition and regulation of subgenomic RNA synthesis.","output":"A positive-strand RNA virus with three very different subgenomic RNA promoters."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide the latest evidence for delivering safe and effective anesthesia care for pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to highlight continuing gaps in the literature.

From the start of the pandemic, pediatric anesthesiologists from around the world contributed important insights and shared experience as to how best to adapt anesthesia care for children with COVID-19 requiring general anesthesia and sedation. Although initial efforts focused on creating safe airway management processes, the role of anesthesiologists as perioperative leaders quickly extended to ensuring well-coordinated management of COVID-19 patients throughout the hospital for procedures, including preprocedure testing, patient transport, operating room setup, and ensuring the safety of staff.

Advances in facile and rapid production technologies make IVT-mRNA an appealing alternative to protein- or virus-based medicines. Robust expression levels, lack of genotoxicity, and their manageable immunogenicity benefit its clinical applicability. We postulated that innate immune responses of therapeutically relevant human cells can be tailored or abrogated by combinations of 5-end and internal IVT-mRNA modifications. Using primary human macrophages as targets, our data show the particular importance of uridine modifications for IVT-mRNA performance. Among five nucleotide modification schemes tested, 5-methoxy-uridine outperformed other modifications up to 4-fold increased transgene expression, triggering moderate proinflammatory and non-detectable antiviral responses. Macrophage responses against IVT-mRNAs exhibiting high immunogenicity (e.g., pseudouridine) could be minimized upon HPLC purification. Conversely, 5-end modifications had only modest effects on mRNA expression and immune responses. Our results revealed how the uptake of chemically modified IVT-mRNA impacts human macrophages, responding with distinct patterns of innate immune responses concomitant with increased transient transgene expression. We anticipate our findings are instrumental to predictively address specific cell responses required for a wide range of therapeutic applications from eliciting controlled immunogenicity in mRNA vaccines to, e.g., completely abrogating cell activation in protein replacement therapies.","output":"Chemical modification of uridine modulates mRNA-mediated proinflammatory and antiviral response in primary human macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ex-vivo normothermic perfusion (EVNP) is an emerging strategy in kidney preservation that enables resuscitation and viability assessment under pseudo-physiological conditions prior to transplantation.

We identified 1,811 unique articles dating from January 1956 to July 2021, from which 24 studies were deemed eligible for qualitative analysis. The perfusate commonly used in clinical practice consisted of leukocyte-depleted, packed red blood cells suspended in Ringers lactate solution with Mannitol, dexamethasone, heparin, sodium bicarbonate and a specific nutrient solution supplemented with insulin, glucose, multivitamins and vasodilators. There is increasing support in preclinical studies for non-blood cell-based perfusates, including Steen solution, synthetic haem-based oxygen carriers and acellular perfusates with supraphysiological carbogen mixtures that support adequate oxygenation whilst also enabling gradual rewarming. Extended durations of perfusion (up to 24 h) were also feasible in animal models. Direct comparison between studies was not possible due to study heterogeneity.

The duration of quarantine impacts the psychological status of the general population. However, until now no study has explored the psychological impact of the pandemic and quarantine together with longitudinal changes in the mental health status of Italian elderly. METHODS: An online questionnaire including an assessment of depression, anxiety, anger, post-traumatic stress, subjective cognitive failures, resilience, coping style, and other dimensions related to the pandemic was completed by participants during (T0) and two months after the end (T1) of the quarantine. RESULTS: The sample recruited at T0 included 334 elderly participants. About 45% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, or anger. Moreover, more fear of getting infected was related to more severe depression, anxiety, and anger, but resilience was found to mediate these relationships. More severe depressive and anger symptoms were related to more severe cognitive failures. No significant difference was observed in mental health scores between T0 and T1. Finally, more severe depression at T0 was associated with the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms at T1. CONCLUSIONS: The fear of getting infected, probably due to perceived vulnerability to disease, seems to play a crucial role in the development of psychological symptoms in the elderly, but resilience seems to mediate the impact of fear. The presence of long-term psychological consequences and the possible risk of developing PTS symptoms in the elderly suggest the need for targeted interventions to reduce possible long-term psychological and cognitive consequences.","output":"Mental health status of Italian elderly subjects during and after quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interleukin (IL)-18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family, first identified for its interferon-?3-inducing properties. IL-18 regulates both T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 responses. It acts synergistically with IL-12 in the Th1 paradigm, whereas with IL-2 and without IL-12 it can induce Th2 cytokine production from cluster of differentation (CD)4+ T cells, natural killer (NK cells, NKT cells, as well as from Th1 cells. IL-18 also plays a role in the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a cytokine storm that can be secondary to infections. IL-18-mediated inflammation was largely studied in animal models of bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. These studies highlight the contribution of either IL-18 overproduction by the host or overresponsiveness of the host to IL-18 causing an exaggerated inflammatory burden and leading to tissue injury. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The damage in the later phase of the disease appears to be driven by a cytokine storm, including interleukin IL-1 family members and secondary cytokines like IL-6.

IL-18 blockade has become an appealing therapeutic target and has been tested in some IL-18-mediated rheumatic diseases and infantile-onset macrophage activation syndrome.

The current COVID-19 and previous emerging virus outbreaks highlight the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we showed that a defensin-like peptide P9R exhibited potent antiviral activity against pH-dependent viruses that require endosomal acidification for virus-host membrane fusion, including the enveloped coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), the pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, and the non-enveloped rhinovirus. P9R could significantly protect mice from lethal challenge by A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and showed low possibility to cause drug-resistance virus. Mechanistic studies indicated that the antiviral activity of P9R depended on the direct binding to viruses and the inhibition of virus-host endosomal acidification, which provides a new concept that virus-binding alkaline peptides could broadly inhibit pH-dependent viruses. These results suggest that the dual-functional virus- and host-targeting P9R could be a promising candidate for combating pH-dependent respiratory viruses.Authors Hanjun Zhao, Kelvin K. W.

In recent years, the rise of video gameplay is unprecedented, further triggered by the lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents an end-to-end stress analysis for video gaming stimuli using EEG. The PSD value of the Alpha and Beta bands is computed to calculate the Beta-to-Alpha ratio (BAR). In this article, BAR is used to denote mental stress. Subjects are chosen based on various factors such as gender, gameplay experience, age, and BMI. EEG is recorded using Scan SynAmps2 Express equipment. There are three types of video gameplay: strategic, puzzle, and combinational. Relaxation is accomplished in this study by the use of music of various pitches. Two types of regression analysis are done to mathematically model stress and relaxation curve. Brain topography is rendered to indicate the stressed and relaxed region of the brain. In the relaxed state, the subjects have BAR 0.701, which is considered the baseline value. Non-gamer subjects have an average BAR of 2.403 for 1 hour of strategic video gameplay, whereas gamers have 2.218 BAR concurrently. After 12 minutes of listening to low-pitch music, gamers achieved 0.709 BAR, which is nearly the baseline value.

For non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of our study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients. METHODS: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, the deep venous system of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurovascular diseases and non-severe COVID-19 was investigated with a systematic bedside DUS. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study including 9 acute ischaemic strokes, 1 occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis and 1 haemorrhagic stroke. On admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was of 6 (IQR, 0-20). During the first week after admission, and despite thromboprophylaxis, we found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves' DVT (n = 5). One patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism and 2 other patients died during hospitalization. The outcome was positive for the other patients with a discharge median NIHSS score of 1 (IQR, 0-11). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence (38.5%) of asymptomatic DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients suffering from a neurovascular disease. In the absence of a reliable marker of DVT, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation could be an interesting tool to monitor peripheral venous thrombotic complications in such patients.","output":"High Prevalence of Deep Venous Thrombosis in Non-Severe COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized for a Neurovascular Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Feline coronavirus (FCoV) persistence and evolution were studied in a closed cat-breeding facility with an endemic serotype I FCoV infection. Viral RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the feces and/or plasma of 36 of 42 cats (86%) tested. Of 5 cats, identified as FCoV shedders during the initial survey, 4 had detectable viral RNA in the feces when tested 111 days later. To determine whether this was due to continuous reinfection or to viral persistence, 2 cats were placed in strict isolation and virus shedding in the feces was monitored every 2C4 days. In 1 of the cats, virus shedding continued for up to 7 months. The other animal was sacrificed after 124 days of continuous virus shedding in order to identify the sites of viral replication. Viral mRNA was detected only in the ileum, colon, and rectum. Also in these tissues, FCoV-infected cells were identified by immunohistochemistry. These findings provide the first formal evidence that FCoV causes chronic enteric infections. To assess FCoV heterogeneity in the breeding facility and to study viral evolution during chronic infection, FCoV quasispecies sampled from individual cats were characterized by RT-PCR amplification of selected regions of the viral genome followed by sequence analysis. Phylogenetic comparison of nucleotides 7C146 of ORF7b to corresponding sequences obtained for independent European and American isolates indicated that the viruses in the breeding facility form a clade and are likely to have originated from a single founder infection. Comparative consensus sequence analysis of the more variable region formed by residues 79C478 of the S gene revealed that each cat harbored a distinct FCoV quasispecies. Moreover, FCoV appeared to be subject to immune selection during chronic infection. The combined data support a model in which the endemic infection is maintained by chronically infected carriers. Virtually every cat born to the breeding facility becomes infected, indicating that FCoV is spread very efficiently. FCoV-infected cats, however, appear to resist superinfection by closely related FCoVs.","output":"Persistence and Evolution of Feline Coronavirus in a Closed Cat-Breeding Colony"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to effectively contribute to scientific knowledge, biomedical observations have to be validated and debated by scientists in the relevant field.

Existing interventions to reduce overweight, obesity and unemployment have addressed these challenges independent of each other with limited success. The Adding to Social capital and individual Potential In disadvantaged REgions (ASPIRE) project will develop an innovative model using a combination of skills training and health and wellbeing interventions to improve health, wellbeing, quality of life and reduce overweight, obesity and unemployment in England and France. The aim of this paper is to outline the protocol for evaluating the ASPIRE project to examine the effectiveness of the intervention and clarify the mechanisms and contextual factors which interact to achieve outcomes. METHODS: A mixed-method realist evaluation using a single-group before-and-after design will be used. The evaluation will consist of development of an initial programme theory, theory validation and refinement using quantitative and qualitative data to understand the causal mechanisms, contexts of implementation and their interactions that result in outcomes observed in ASPIRE. Primary outcomes that will be assessed are change in body weight and body mass index, reemployment and a rise on the ASPIRE participation ladder. The ASPIRE participation ladders consists of a series of 5 steps to engage participants in the project. The first step on the ladder is joining an ASPIRE hub with paid employment as the final step on the ladder. Secondary outcomes will be physical activity, diet quality, self-efficacy and health-related quality of life. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are appropriate in this study because the use of validated questionnaires and objective measures will demonstrate how much the intervention addressed outcomes related to weight loss and reemployment and the qualitative data (photovoice) will provide insights into the contexts and experiences that are unique to participants in the project. DISCUSSION: The results from this evaluation will provide an understanding of how a model of health-related interventions which improve health, wellbeing and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle could reduce overweight, obesity and unemployment. The findings will enable the adaptation of this model for effective implementation in different contexts and circumstances.

Due to factors such as the current quarantine, this type of violence has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed to assess the frequency of domestic violence against women and identify the risk factor among Iranian women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This online cross-sectional study was conducted on 203 Iranian women during MayCJune 2020. Data were collected using a domestic violence questionnaire, which measured three forms of violence, including physical, emotional, and sexual violence. A link of the questionnaire was distributed among anonymous subjects through social networking apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. The subjects were asked to complete the questionnaire based on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and a regression model. RESULTS: The descriptive results showed that the mean domestic violence against women in all the participants was 34.9 (SD: 17.28). In addition, 26.6% (n = 84), 26.1% (n = 53), and 21.2% of the subjects (n = 43) experienced high levels of physical, emotional, and sexual violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The regression model also indicated that lower age, illiteracy/primary education, previous marriage(s), and unwanted/unwise marriage were the significant risk factors for domestic violence against women. CONCLUSION: According to the results, domestic violence against women is common among Iranian women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, strategies are urgently needed to prevent and minimize such domestic violence, and such strategies could be adopted through providing educational opportunities, raising awareness, promoting wanted/wise marriage, and providing social support and rehabilitation opportunities to vulnerable social groups, especially vulnerable women.

Nevertheless, little is known about possible differences between patients with diabetes and without diabetes in this regard. So the aim of the study was to investigate the association between 28-day case fatality according to certain ECG changes comparing AMI cases with and without diabetes from the general population. From 2000 until 2017 a total of 9756 AMI cases was prospectively recorded in the study Area of Augsburg, Germany. Each case was assigned to one of the following groups according to admission ECG: 'ST-elevation', 'ST-depression', 'only T-negativity', 'predominantly bundle branch block', 'unspecific changes' and 'normal ECG' (the last two were put together for regression analyses). Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models were calculated to compare 28-day case-fatality between the ECG groups for the total sample and separately for diabetes and non-diabetes cases. For the non-diabetes group, the parsimonious logistic regression model revealed significantly better 28-day-outcome for the 'normal ECG / unspecific changes' group (OR: 0.47 [0.29-0.76]) compared to the reference group (STEMI). Contrary, in AMI cases with diabetes the category 'normal ECG / unspecific changes' was not significantly associated with lower short-term mortality (OR: 0.87 [0.49-1.54]). Neither of the other ECG groups was significantly associated with 28-day-mortality in the parsimonious logistic regression models. Consequently, the absence of AMI-typical changes in the admission ECG predicts favorable short-term mortality only in non-diabetic cases, but not so in patients with diabetes.","output":"Admission ECG changes predict short term-mortality after acute myocardial infarction less reliable in patients with diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate-resilient crops and crop varieties have been recommended as a way for farmers to cope with or adapt to climate change, but despite the apparent benefits, rates of adoption by smallholder farmers are highly variable.

The most prevalent trait in our dataset was drought tolerance, followed by water-use efficiency. Our analysis found that the most important determinants of adoption of climate-resilient crops were the availability and effectiveness of extension services and outreach, followed by education levels of heads of households, farmers' access to inputs-especially seeds and fertilizers-and socio-economic status of farming families. About 53% of studies reported that social differences such as sex, age, marital status and ethnicity affected the adoption of varieties or crops as climate change-adaptation strategies.

Our two research questions are (1) what are the users experience and satisfaction levels with the three apps? and (2) what are the main issues (problems) that users have reported about the apps? METHODS: We assess the popularity of the apps and end users perceptions based on user reviews in app stores. We conduct three types of analysis (data mining, sentiment analysis and topic modelling) to derive insights from the combined set of 25 583 user reviews of the aforementioned three apps (submitted by users until the end of 2020). RESULTS: Results show that end users have been generally dissatisfied with the apps under study, except the Scottish app. Some of the major issues that users have reported are high battery drainage and doubts on whether apps are really working. DISCUSSION: Towards the end of 2020, the much-awaited COVID-19 vaccines started to be available, but still, analysing the users feedback and technical issues of these apps, in retrospective, is valuable to learn the right lessons to be ready for similar circumstances in future. CONCLUSION: Our results show that more work is needed by the stakeholders behind the apps (eg, apps software engineering teams, public-health experts and decision makers) to improve the software quality and, as a result, the public adoption of these apps. For example, they should be designed to be as simple as possible to operate (need for usability).","output":"What do users think of the UKs three COVID-19 contact-tracing apps?

This study aims to assess the impact of pharmacist-conducted medication reconciliation performed within 48 h of hospital admission to the orthopedic surgical department. METHODS: This was a prospective single-arm study conducted in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Lebanon between October 2019 and April 2020. Participants were adult inpatients hospitalized for orthopedic surgeries with  1 outpatient medications. Properly trained pharmacy resident obtained the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) and led the reconciliation process. The primary endpoint was the number of reconciliation errors (REs) identified. Descriptive statistics were used to report participants responses and relevant findings. Linear regression was performed with the number of REs as a continuous dependent variable using backward method. Results were assumed to be significant when p was < 0.05. RESULTS: The study included 100 patients with a mean age of 73.8 years, admitted for elective (54%) or emergency (46%) surgeries. Half of the study population had  5 home medications. The mean time for taking BPMH was around 8 min. A total of 110 REs were identified in 74 patient cases. The most common discrepancies consisted of medication omission (89.1%) and the most common medications involved were antihyperlipidemic agents. Twenty-four REs were judged as clinically significant, and four as serious. The most common interventions included the addition of a medication (71.9%). Most of the relayed interventions (84.5%) were accepted. The number of home medications was the only variable significantly associated with the number of REs ( 0.492; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pharmacy-led medication reconciliation upon admission to orthopedic surgery department can reduce reconciliation errors and improve medication safety.

Crowded indoor environments, such as schools, represent possible hotspots for virus transmission since the basic non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures applied so far (e.g. social distancing) do not eliminate the airborne transmission mode. There is widespread consensus that improved ventilation is needed to minimize the transmission potential of airborne viruses in schools, whether through mechanical systems or ad-hoc manual airing procedures in naturally ventilated buildings. However, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding exactly what ventilation rates are required, and how to best achieve these targets with limited time and resources. This paper uses a mass balance approach to quantify the ability of both mechanical ventilation and ad-hoc airing procedures to mitigate airborne transmission risk in the classroom environment. For naturally-ventilated classrooms, we propose a novel feedback control strategy using CO2 concentrations to continuously monitor and adjust the airing procedure. Our case studies show how such procedures can be applied in the real world to support the reopening of schools during the pandemic. Our results also show the inadequacy of relying on absolute CO2 concentration thresholds as the sole indicator of airborne transmission risk.","output":"Ventilation procedures to minimize the airborne transmission of viruses at schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Se presenta una visin, desde Cienfuegos, sobre la marcha de la pandemia de COVID-19, despus de algo ms de dos meses de identificado el primer caso en Cuba.

To test the hypothesis that the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit the perforin expression, we determined the kinetics of immune responses of CD8+ T cells to low dose (LD) or high dose (HD) of S1 stimulation through an in vitro dendritic cell (DC)-T cell model over seven days of incubation. The cytotoxic activity and intracellular perforin expression of CD8+ T cells induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were aberrantly lower than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day three of incubation. Discrepantly, the levels of lymphoproliferation and cytokine (interferon- and tumor necrosis factor-) production induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were significantly higher than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day four. The dose-related responses between doses of S1 and intracellular perforin expression showed a significant linear correlation with a negative slope. In conclusion, the S1 subunit may suppress the perforin expression in CD8+ T cells to decrease the cytotoxic capacity to kill spike-presenting cells in a dose-dependent manner;the persistence of antigen presentation may result in an overproduction of interferon- and subsequent proinflammatory cytokines. That may help explain the insufficient cytotoxicity against high quantities of viruses or highly replicated strains of SARS-CoV-2 in severe cases of COVID-19.","output":"Dose-Related Aberrant Inhibition of Intracellular Perforin Expression by S1 Subunit of Spike Glycoprotein That Contains Receptor-Binding Domain from SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sources of natural threats include weather extremes, tectonic and soil movements, diseases, and other natural hazards Epidemics, epiphytes, epizootics, and pandemics can be included in the section of diseases It is the pandemic that became the biggest threat to the whole world in 2020 Everyone knows that it is a coronavirus infection - COVID-19 This epidemic had spread from China since the end of 2019 when it gradually affected the whole world from Australia and Europe to America This threat affects all areas of life for each of us It is the area of the economy, the environment, the restriction of citizens' rights, and others Our article will aim to focus on the economic impacts of this pandemic mainly from SME (Small and medium enterprises) point of view Each company seldom finds itself in a situation where it has to deal with a crisis Each crisis has its specifics, and have the negative impact on profit of companies However, the crisis in 2020 is something specific It is not caused by the collapse of banks or the country's unfortunate economic or political situation The coronavirus crisis has affected the all sized companies (as Large as SME), thanks to limited opportunities to leave home, a ban on traveling to foreign countries, and, in essence, a slowdown in the entire economic cycle The financial crisis with coronavirus is further divided into two types Firstly, there is the crisis of companies that could not produce during a state of emergency (i e , at the time of the greatest threat to the population from coronavirus) Secondly, these are companies that operated during the crisis, thanks to the running-up contracts, but the crisis came later, after the state of emergency For example, it is due to the low number of orders for a given product due to limitations in times of emergency The aim of the article is to point out not only the economic but also the environmental impacts of the coronavirus crisis on the SME Mainly because of the reduction in the production and operation of companies that had a significant impact on the environment worldwide Based on the analysis performed in this article, will be proposed measures aimed to mitigating negative impact of the crisis, mainly by implementation of project management tools in the SME ? 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference All rights reserved","output":"COVID-19 and the project management in SME"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: More than 200 million people live in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission where Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ) was recommended in 2012 by WHO. This strategy is now implemented widely and protected more than 19 million children in 2018. It was previously reported that exposure to SMC reduced antibody levels to AMA1, MSP-1(42) and CSP, but the duration of exposure to SMC up to three 3 years, had no effect on antibody levels to MSP-1(42) and CSP. METHODS: In 2017, a cross-sectional survey was carried out 1 month after the last dose of SMC had been given to children aged 4C5 years randomly selected from areas where SMC had been given for 2 or 4 years during the malaria transmission season. A total of 461 children were enrolled, 242 children in areas where SMC had been implemented for 4 years and 219 children in areas where SMC had been implemented for 2 years. Antibody extracted from dry blood spots was used to measure IgG levels to the malaria antigens CSP, MSP-1(42) and AMA1 by ELISA. RESULTS: The prevalence of antibodies to MSP-1(42) was similar in children who had received SMC for 4 years compared to those who had received SMC for only 2 years (85.1 vs 86.0%, ajusted odd ratio (aOR) = 1.06, 95% confidence intervals (CI 0.62C1.80), p = 0.80). The prevalence of antibodies to AMA-1 and to CSP was not lower in children who received SMC for 4 years compared to those who had received SMC for only 2 years (95.3 vs 88.8%, aOR = 3.16, 95% CI 1.44C6.95, p = 0.004 for AMA-1; and 91.2 vs 81.9%, aOR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.70C5.76, p < 0.001 for CSP). Median antibody levels for anti-MSP-1(42) IgG were not significatively inferior in children who had received SMC for four rather than 2 years (0.88 (IQR: 0.64C1.15) and 0.95 ((0.68C1.15), respectively), anti-CSP (1.30 (1.00C1.56) and 1.17 (0.87C1.47)), and anti-AMA-1 (1.45 (1.24C1.68) and 1.41 (1.17C1.64)). CONCLUSION: In an area of high seasonal malaria transmission, children who had received SMC for 4 years did not had lower seropositivity or antibody levels to AMA1, MSP-1(42) and CSP compared to children who had received SMC for only 2 years suggesting that children who have received SMC for 4 years may not be more at risk of malaria after the cessation of SMC than children who have received SMC for a shorter period.","output":"Effect of 4 years of seasonal malaria chemoprevention on the acquisition of antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum antigens in Ouelessebougou, Mali"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 2 leprosy reaction, or erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), involves a complex interaction between the host's immune system and Mycobacterium leprae.

The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria. In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations. We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The studies on \\"COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus. In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries. The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020.

We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro. The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.

In May, the infection numbers registered a fall followed by a second new rise, not proportionally reflected by an increase in the number of deaths. We aimed to investigate the relationship between disease prevalence and infection fatality rate (IFR), and the number of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital admissions over time, to develop a predictive model, as well as appraising the potential contributing factors underpinning this complex relationship. METHODS: A prospective epidemiological study using data from six countries collected between 10 March and 4 September 2020. Data on the number of daily hospital and ICU admissions with COVID-19 were gathered, and the IFR and the prevalence were calculated. Trends over time were analysed. A linear regression model was used to determine the association between the fatality rates and the number of admissions. FINDINGS: The prediction model confirmed the linear association between the fatality rates and the numbers of ICU and hospital admissions. The exception was during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the model underestimated the fatalities indicating that a substantial number of deaths occurred outside of the hospitals. The fatality rates decreased in all countries from May until September regardless of the trends in prevalence, differences in healthcare systems or strategic variations in handling the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: The observed gradual reduction in COVID-19 fatality rates over time despite varying disease prevalence and public health measures across multiple countries warrants search for a biological explanation. While our understanding of this novel virus grows, hospital and ICU admission rates remain effective predictors of patient outcomes which can be used as early warning signs for escalation of public health measures.","output":"Epidemiological trends in COVID-19 pandemic: prospective critical appraisal of observations from six countries in Europe and the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this study was to reveal the impacts of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the functioning of neurosurgery clinics and to determine the anxiety levels and attitudes of Turkish neurosurgeons towards their profession during the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to generate knowledge concerning challenges and strategies in operationalizing the ISN framework in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. METHODS: The ISN framework was operationalized in partnership with country teams in Kenya and Uganda over a 3-y period as part of the Implementation Science Initiative. An action research methodology (developmental evaluation) was used to provide timely feedback to the country teams, facilitate adaptations and adjustments, and generate the data presented in this article concerning challenges and strategies. RESULTS: Operationalization of the ISN framework proceeded by first articulating a set of guiding principles as touchstones for the country teams and further articulating 6 components of an IS system to facilitate development of work streams. Challenges and strategies in implementing these 6 components were then documented. The knowledge gained through this experience led to the development of an IS system operational model to assist the application of IS in other LMIC settings. CONCLUSIONS: Future investments in IS should prioritize a system- and capacity-building approach in order to realize its full potential and become institutionalized at country level. The operational model can guide others to improve the implementation of IS within a broad range of programs.","output":"Operationalizing Implementation Science in Nutrition: The Implementation Science Initiative in Kenya and Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Because breastfeeding offers short- and long- term health benefits to mothers and children, breastfeeding promotion and support is a public health priority. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to be transmitted via breastmilk. Moreover, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be contained in breastmilk of mothers with history of COVID-19 infection or vaccination. WHO recommends direct breastfeeding as the preferred infant feeding option during the COVID-19 pandemic, even among women with COVID-19; but conflicting practices have been adopted, which could widen existing inequities in breastfeeding. This study aims to describe how information about breastfeeding was communicated in Mexican media during the pandemic and assess Mexican adults beliefs regarding breastfeeding among mothers infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective content analysis of media coverage on breastfeeding in Mexico between March 1 and September 24, 2020, excluding advertisements. For the content analysis, we performed both a sentiment analysis and an analysis based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) for breastfeeding promotion. Additionally, we conducted a descriptive analysis of nationally representative data on adults beliefs about breastfeeding from the July 2020 round of the ENCOVID-19 survey in Mexico and stratified the results by gender, age, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: A total of 1014 publications on breastfeeding were identified on the internet and television and in newspapers and magazines. Most information was published during World Breastfeeding Week, celebrated in August. The sentiment analysis showed that 57.2% of all information was classified as positive. The SWOT analysis indicated that most information focused on current actions, messages, policies, or programs that enable breastfeeding (i.e., strengths) or those not currently in place but that may enable breastfeeding (i.e., opportunities) for breastfeeding promotion. However, ENCOVID-19 survey results showed that 67.3% of adults living in households with children under 3 years of age believe that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed, and 19.8% do not know whether these mothers should breastfeed. These beliefs showed differences both by gender and by socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: While the Mexican government endorsed the recommendation on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, communication was sporadic, inconstant and unequal across types of media. There was a widespread notion that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed and due to differences on beliefs by socioeconomic status, health inequities could be exacerbated by increasing the risk of poorer breastfeeding practices and preventing vulnerable groups from reaping the short and long-term benefits of breastfeeding.","output":"Breastfeeding media coverage and beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico: implications for breastfeeding equity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperinflammation contributes to lung injury and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To understand the underlying mechanisms involved in lung pathology, we investigated the role of the lung-specific immune response.

By tracking T cell clones across tissues, we identified clonally expanded tissue-resident memory-like Th17 cells (Trm17 cells) in the lungs even after viral clearance. These Trm17 cells were characterized by a a potentially pathogenic cytokine expression profile of IL17A and CSF2 (GM-CSF). Interactome analysis suggests that Trm17 cells can interact with lung macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which have been associated with disease severity and lung damage. High IL-17A and GM-CSF protein levels in the serum of COVID-19 patients were associated with a more severe clinical course. Collectively, our study suggests that pulmonary Trm17 cells are one potential orchestrator of the hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","output":"Clonal expansion and activation of tissue-resident memory-like Th17 cells expressing GM-CSF in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The damage inflicted by the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic upon humanity is and will continue to be considerable. Unprecedented progress made in global health over the past 20 years has reverted and economic growth has already evaporated, giving rise to a global recession, the likes of which we may not have experienced since the Second World War. Our aim is to draw the attention of the neglected tropical disease (NTD) community towards some of the major emerging economic opportunities which are quickly appearing on the horizon as a result of COVID-19. MAIN TEXT: This scoping review relied on a literature search comprised of a sample of articles, statements, and press releases on initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19, while supporting economic recovery. Of note, the donor scenario and economic development agendas are highly dynamic and expected to change rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, as are donor and lender priorities. CONCLUSIONS: The NTD community, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), will need to work quickly, diligently, and in close collaboration with decision-makers and key stakeholders, across sectors at national and international level to secure its position. Doing so might enhance the odds of grasping potential opportunities to access some of the massive resources that are now available in the form of contributions from corporate foundations, trust funds, loans, debt relieve schemes, and other financial mechanisms, as part of the ongoing and future economic development agendas and public health priorities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper should serve as a starting point for the NTD community to seek much needed financial support in order to sustain and revitalize control and elimination efforts pertaining to NTDs in LMICs.","output":"Efforts to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: potential entry points for neglected tropical diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The management of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), caused by a new human virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), is challenging. Recently, there have been several reports with inconsistent results after treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) on critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19, which was produced with a neutralizing antibody titer and tested in a P3 or P4 laboratory. However, due to the limitation of the conditions on mass production of plasma, most producers hardly had the capability to isolate the neutralizing antibody. Here, we report the clinical courses of three critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19 receiving CP treatments by total immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer collection. METHODS: Three patients with COVID\\\\19 in this study were laboratory confirmed to be positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, with radiographic and clinical features of pneumonia. CP was collected by total IgG titer of 160 (range, 200\\\\225 mL), and patients were transfused between 20 and 30 days after disease onset at the critical illness stage as a trial in addition to standard care. The clinical courses of these patients, including laboratory results and pulmonary functional and image studies after receiving convalescent plasma infusions, were reviewed. RESULTS: No therapeutic effect of CP was observed in any of the patients; instead, all three patients deteriorated and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. A potential cytokine storm 4 hours after infusion of CP in Patient 2 was observed. No more patients were put on the trial of CP transfusion.

The aim of this study was to investigate the method used by the Imperial College COVID-19 Research Team (ICCRT) for estimation of NPI effects from the system theoretical viewpoint of model identifiability. Methods: An input-sensitivity analysis was performed by running the original software code of the systems model that was devised to estimate the impact of NPIs on the reproduction number of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and presented online by ICCRT in Report 13 on March 30 2020. An empirical investigation was complemented by an analysis of practical parameter identifiability, using an estimation theoretical framework. Results: Despite being simplistic with few free parameters, the system model was found to suffer from severe input sensitivities. Our analysis indicated that the model lacks practical parameter identifiability from data. The analysis also showed that this limitation is fundamental, and not something readily resolved should the model be driven with data of higher reliability. Discussion: Reports based on system models have been instrumental to policymaking during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. With much at stake during all phases of a pandemic, we conclude that it is crucial to thoroughly scrutinise any SARS-CoV-2 effect analysis or prediction model prior to considering its use as decision support in policymaking.

Although this global variation is largely affected by socio-medical situations in each country, there is also high individual-level variation attributable to elderliness and certain underlying medical conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. As both elderliness and the aforementioned chronic conditions are often associated with an altered gut microbiota, resulting in disrupted gut barrier integrity, and gut symptoms have consistently been associated with more severe illness in COVID-19 patients, it is possible that dysfunction of the gut as a whole influences COVID-19 severity. This article summarizes the accumulating evidence that supports the hypothesis that an altered gut microbiota and its associated leaky gut may contribute to the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms and occasionally to additional multiorgan complications that may lead to severe illness by allowing leakage of the causative coronavirus into the circulatory system.","output":"Do an Altered Gut Microbiota and an Associated Leaky Gut Affect COVID-19 Severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cell nuclear architecture has been explored in cancer and laminopathies but not in neurodegenerative disorders. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to neuronal death. Chromosome-wide changes in gene expression have been reported in HD, not only in the brain but also in peripheral blood cells, but whether this translates into nuclear and chromosome architecture alterations has not yet been studied. METHODS: We investigate nuclear structure and chromosome organization in HD blood cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization in ultrathin cryosections (cryoFISH), coupled with machine learning image analysis to evaluate size, distribution, and morphology of nuclei and chromosomes. Four chromosomes were analyzed based on up- or downregulation of gene expression in HD. RESULTS: We show that blood cells from HD patients display increased nuclear size and filamentary shape, increased size of gene-rich chromosome 19, decreased filamentary shape of gene-rich chromosome 22, and a more radially centralized position for chromosome 19, whereas chromosomes 4 and 5 do not show detectable differences.

METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study on 520 consecutive patients with essential hypertension taking a stable triple therapy in whom 24-h ambulatory BP was evaluated. Both number of pills and antihypertensive treatment intensity (ATI), as possible pharmacological predictors of ambulatory BP control, were taken into account. RESULTS: A total of 189 (36.3%) patients were taking triple therapy with ACEi and 331 (63.7%) patients were taking triple therapy with ARB. Mean age was 62.7  12.2 years. Patients on triple therapy with ACEi had a significantly lower ATI and took fewer antihypertensive pills than patients on triple therapy with ARB (22.2% of patients took a single-pill triple fixed-dose combination). Patients taking triple therapy with ACEi had higher prevalence of both 24-h (54.8% vs 44.0%; p = 0.019) and daytime BP control (61.8% vs 49.2%; p = 0.006) than patients taking triple therapy with ARB, even after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking habit, type 2 diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and ATI [OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.1C2.2) and OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1C2.4), respectively]. However, these independent associations with ambulatory BP control were lost when the number of antihypertensive pills was included in the model. CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of ambulatory BP control found in patients taking a triple therapy with ACEi was affected by the lower number of antihypertensive pills taken, which was also the key predictor of ambulatory BP control in our study. This confirms the importance of fixed-dose combinations in the management of essential hypertension.","output":"The Number of Pills, Rather Than the Type of ReninCAngiotensin System Inhibitor, Predicts Ambulatory Blood Pressure Control in Essential Hypertensives on Triple Therapy: A Real-Life Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The optimal revascularization strategy remains uncertain in multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD). The durability of the surgical grafts should be weighed against the decreased invasiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR), a combination of PCI and surgery, could be a feasible alternative. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and all-cause mortality after both endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting (Endo-CABG) and the HCR procedure. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, 347 consecutive patients have been subjected to an Endo-CABG procedure, of which 103 underwent HCR between January 2016 and January 2018. A propensity score matching analysis was performed to match 103 Endo-CABG alone patients to the 103 HCR patients. The Endo-CABG procedure was performed through 3 endoscopic ports (5 mm) in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th intercostal space and a utility port of 3 cm. RESULTS: In both the HCR and matched endo-CABG alone group, the 30-day mortality was acceptable (0% in the HCR group and 1.94% in the matched Endo-CABG alone group, p = 0.155). Additionally, the occurrence of MACCE after a mean follow-up of 1188  538 days was similar in both groups (9.71% and 11.65% for the HCR and matched Endo-CABG alone group, respectively, p = 0.652). Still, the long-term all-cause mortality over this period was significantly higher in the matched Endo-CABG alone group (2.91% after the HCR procedure and 11.65% after matched Endo-CABG alone, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: HCR has some advantages over Endo-CABG alone regarding the all-cause mortality, cross-clamping time, intensive care unit, and hospital length of stay. Therefore, HCR may be a suitable alternative therapy for patients with MVCAD.","output":"Clinical results after hybrid coronary revascularization with totally endoscopic coronary surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pain in response to various types of acute injury can be a protective stimulus to prevent the organism from using the injured part and allow tissue repair and healing. On the other hand, neuropathic pain, defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, is a debilitating pathology. The TRPA1 neurons in the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) respond to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce pain. In acute nerve injury and inflammation, macrophages infiltrating the site of injury undergo an oxidative burst, and generate ROS that promote tissue repair and induce pain via TRPA1. The latter discourages using the injured limb, with a lack of movement helping wound healing. In chronic inflammation caused by diabetes, cancer etc., ROS levels increase systemically and modulate TRPA1 neuronal functions and cause debilitating neuropathic pain. It is important to distinguish between drug targets that elicit protective vs. debilitating pain when developing effective drugs for neuropathic pain. In this context, the connection of the Angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT(2)R) to neuropathic pain presents an interesting dilemma. Several lines of evidence show that AT(2)R activation promotes anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive signaling, tissue repair, and suppresses ROS in chronic inflammatory models. Conversely, some studies suggest that AT(2)R antagonists are anti-nociceptive and therefore AT(2)R is a drug target for neuropathic pain. However, AT(2)R expression in nociceptive neurons is lacking, indicating that neuronal AT(2)R is not involved in neuropathic pain. It is also important to consider that Novartis terminated their phase II clinical trial (EMPHENE) to validate that AT(2)R antagonist EMA401 mitigates post-herpetic neuralgia. This trial, conducted in Australia, United Kingdom, and a number of European and Asian countries in 2019, was discontinued due to pre-clinical drug toxicity data. Moreover, early data from the trial did not show statistically significant positive outcomes. These facts suggest that may AT(2)R not be the proper drug target for neuropathic pain in humans and its inhibition can be harmful.","output":"Angiotensin Type 2 Receptors: Painful, or Not?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to social and economic disruption globally It is urgently needed to understand the structure and function of the viral proteins for understanding of the viral infection and pathogenesis and development of prophylaxis and treatment strategies Coronavirus non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) is a notable virulence factor with versatile roles in virus-host interactions and exhibits unique characteristics on sequence, structure, and function mode However, the roles and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 are currently unclear Here, we analyze the nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 from the following perspectives: (1) bioinformatics analysis reveals that the novel nsp1 is conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains and shares significant sequence identity with SARS-CoV nsp1;(2) structure modeling shows a 3D /-fold of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 highly similar to that of the SARS-CoV homolog;(3) by detailed, functional review of nsp1 proteins from other coronaviruses (especially SARS-CoV) and comparison of the protein sequence and structure, we further analyzed the potential roles of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 in manipulating host mRNA translation, antiviral innate immunity and inflammation response and thus likely promoting viral infection and pathogenesis, which are merited to be tested in the future Finally, we discussed how understanding of the novel nsp1 may provide valuable insights into the designs of drugs and vaccines against the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic","output":"SARS-CoV-2 nsp1: Bioinformatics, Potential Structural and Functional Features, and Implications for Drug/Vaccine Designs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nebulised medical aerosols are designed to deliver drugs to the lungs to aid in the treatment of respiratory diseases. However, an unintended consequence is the potential for fugitive emissions during patient treatment, which may pose a risk factor in both clinical and homecare settings. Methods: The current study examined the potential for fugitive emissions, using albuterol sulphate as a tracer aerosol during high-flow therapy. A nasal cannula was connected to a head model or alternatively, a interface was connected to a tracheostomy tube in combination with a simulated adult and paediatric breathing profile. Two aerodynamic particle sizers (APS) recorded time-series aerosol concentrations and size distributions at two different distances relative to the simulated patient. Results: The results showed that the quantity and characteristics of the fugitive emissions were influenced by the interface type, patient type and supplemental gas-flow rate. There was a trend in the adult scenarios; as the flow rate increased, the fugitive emissions and the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol both decreased. The fugitive emissions were comparable when using the adult breathing profiles for the nasal cannula and tracheostomy interfaces; however, there was a noticeable distinction between the two interfaces when compared for the paediatric breathing profiles. The highest recorded aerosol concentration was 0.370  0.046 mg m(?3) from the tracheostomy interface during simulated paediatric breathing with a gas-flow rate of 20 L/min. The averaged MMAD across all combinations ranged from 1.248 to 1.793 m by the APS at a distance of 0.8 m away from the patient interface. Conclusions: Overall, the results highlight the potential for secondary inhalation of fugitive emissions released during simulated aerosol treatment with concurrent high-flow therapy.

Hospital systems must be efficient to prevent loss of human life. Smart hospitals promise a health revolution by capturing and transmitting patient data to doctors in real-time via a wireless sensor network. However, there is a significant difficulty in assessing the performance and availability of such systems in real contexts due to failures not being tolerated and high implementation costs. This paper adopts analytical models to assess the performance and availability of intelligent hospital systems without having to invest in real equipment beforehand. Two Stochastic Petri Net models were proposed to represent intelligent hospital architectures. One model is used to assess performance, and another to assess availability. The models are pretty parametric, making it possible to calibrate the resources, service times, times between failures, and times between repairs. The availability model, for example, allows you to define 48 parameters, allowing you to evaluate a large number of scenarios. The analysis showed that the arrival rate in the performance model is an impacting parameter. It was possible to observe the close relationship between MRT, resource utilization, and discard rate in different scenarios, especially for high arrival rates. Three scenarios were explored considering the second model. The highest availability results were observed in scenario A, composed of server redundancy (local and remote). Such scenariowith redundancypresented an availability of 99.9199%, that is, 7.01 h/year of inactivity. In addition, this work presents a sensitivity analysis that identifies the most critical components of the architecture.

The aim of the study was to conduct qualitative research involving multiple stakeholders to explore the perceived effectiveness and shortcomings of the CME system in Georgia, its place in the health system and potential means of improving it. DESIGN: This is a qualitative study. All data were collected using semistructured individual interviews. The questions were derived from the relevant literature. Data analysis was conducted using comparative strategy. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed individuals from CME providers, medical establishments, the professional development board (PDB), and the Regulatory Agency for Medical and Pharmaceutical Activities. We thus interviewed 23 people (11 people from CME providers, 8 people from medical establishments, 3 PDB members and 1 person from Legal Entity under Public Law Regulatory Agency for Medical and Pharmaceutical Activities). RESULTS: Georgia has had experience of mandatory CME in the past, which had been criticised for its poor quality and bureaucratic processes. CME is viewed as an essential developmental process for medical professionals, the outcome of which is to deliver high-quality medical care. Our interviewees identified a clear need for high-quality CME courses. However, significant challenges that need to be overcome include financial barriers, doctors attitudes to CME, a lack of CME courses in all medical specialties and relatively weak professional associations.

Reports further indicate that COVID-19 patients may develop a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases due to reasons not fully understood. Even so, the landscape of autoantibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection remains uncharted territory. To gain more insight, we carried out a comprehensive assessment of autoantibodies known to be linked to diverse autoimmune diseases observed in COVID-19 patients, in a cohort of 248 individuals, of which 171 were COVID-19 patients (74 with mild, 65 moderate, and 32 with severe disease) and 77 were healthy controls. Dysregulated autoantibody serum levels, characterized mainly by elevated concentrations, occurred mostly in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 infection, and was accompanied by a progressive disruption of physiologic IgG and IgA autoantibody signatures. A similar perturbation was found in patients with anosmia.

Moreover, higher levels of autoantibodies (mainly IgGs) were seen in the elderly with severe disease compared with young COVID-19 patients with severe disease.

The effects of SARS and human deaths from Avian Flu are compared directly according to the number of human deaths. The nature of the short run and long run relationship is examined empirically by estimating a static line fixed effect model and a difference transformation dynamic model, respectively. Empirical results from the static fixed effect and difference transformation dynamic models are consistent, and indicate that both the short run and long run SARS effect have a more significant impact on international tourist arrivals than does Avian Flu. In addition, the effects of deaths arising from both SARS and Avian Flu suggest that SARS is more important to international tourist arrivals than is Avian Flu.

The resultant disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic, leading to severe health and economic burdens. Although the recently announced vaccines against COVID-19 has rekindled hope, there is still a major challenge to urgently meet the global need for rapid treatment of the pandemic. Given the urgency of the CoV outbreak, we propose a strategy to screen potential broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Since the essential functional domains of CoV are extensively homologous, the availability of two types of mild CoV, HCoV-OC43 and MHV, should provide a valuable tool for the rapid identification of promising drugs against CoV without the drawbacks of level three biological confinements. The luciferase reporter gene is introduced into HCoV-OC43 and MHV to indicate viral activity, and hence the antiviral efficiency of screened drugs can be quantified by luciferase activity. Compounds with antiviral activity against both HCoV-OC43 and MHV are further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 after structural optimizations. This system allows large-scale compounds to be screened to search for broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, providing potential alternatives for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV.","output":"A high-throughput drug screening strategy against coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tacaribe virus (TCRV) is a mammalian arenavirus that was first isolated from artibeus bats in the 1950s. Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) caused a disease similar to that of naturally infected bats. Although substantial attention has focused on bats as reservoir hosts of viruses that cause human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and their pathogens. We performed a transcriptome-wide study to illuminate the response of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV. Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues revealed global and organ-specific responses associated with innate antiviral responses, including interferon alpha/beta and Toll-like receptor signaling, activation of complement cascades, and cytokine signaling, among others. Genes encoding proteins involved in adaptive immune responses, such as gamma interferon signaling and costimulation of T cells by the CD28 family, were also altered in response to TCRV infection. Immunoglobulin gene expression was also elevated in the spleens of infected bats, including IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. These results indicate an active innate and adaptive immune response to TCRV infection occurred but did not prevent fatal disease. This de novo assembly provides a high-throughput data set of the Jamaican fruit bat and its host response to TCRV infection, which remains a valuable tool to understand the molecular signatures involved in antiviral responses in bats. IMPORTANCE As reservoir hosts of viruses associated with human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and viruses. Using Jamaican fruit bats infected with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) as a model, we characterized the gene expression responses to infection in different tissues and identified pathways involved with the response to infection.

DESIGN: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify trials testing viral vaccines that had not advanced to phase 2 before 2005, and the progress of each vaccine from phase 1 through to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure was tracked. Trial characteristics were double-coded. (Registration: Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/dmuzx/]). SETTING: Trials launched between January 2005 and March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Preventive viral vaccine candidates for 23 emerging or reemerged viral infectious diseases. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was the probability of vaccines advancing from launch of phase 2 to FDA licensure within 10 years. RESULTS: In total, 606 clinical trials forming 220 distinct development trajectories (267 343 enrolled participants) were identified. The probability of vaccines progressing from phase 2 to licensure within 10 years was 10.0% (95% CI, 2.6% to 16.9%), with most approvals representing H1N1 or H5N1 vaccines. The average timeline from phase 2 to approval was 4.4 years (range, 6.4 weeks to 13.9 years). The probabilities of advancing from phase 1 to 2, phase 2 to 3, and phase 3 to licensure within the total available follow-up time were 38.2% (CI, 30.7% to 45.0%), 38.3% (CI, 23.1% to 50.5%), and 61.1% (CI, 3.7% to 84.3%), respectively.

Electrode activation leads to the functionalization of the graphite surface with epoxy, OH, C=O, and COOH oxygenic groups and changes the carbon surface morphology and electronic structure; thus, improving the electrode's electroactivity relative to the untreated graphite. In this study, we conduct density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate functionalization's role towards the positive half-cell reaction of the vanadium redox flow battery. The DFT calculations show that oxygenic groups improve the graphite felt's affinity towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple in the following order: C=O > COOH > OH > basal plane. Projected density of states (PDOS) calculations show that these groups increase the electrode's sp3 hybridization in the same order. We conclude that the increase in the sp3 hybridization is responsible for the improved electroactivity, while the oxygenic groups' presence is responsible for this sp3 increment.

This study aimed to identify potential natural product-derived inhibitory molecules against the p38&#945; MAPK receptor to mitigate the eliciting of pro-inflammatory cytokines using computational techniques. The 3D X-ray structure of the receptor with PDB ID 3ZS5 was energy minimized using GROMACS and used for molecular docking via AutoDock Vina. The molecular docking was validated with an acceptable area under the curve (AUC) of 0.704, which was computed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A compendium of 38,271 natural products originating from Africa and China together with eleven known p38 MAPK inhibitors were screened against the receptor. Four potential lead compounds ZINC1691180, ZINC5519433, ZINC4520996 and ZINC5733756 were identified. The compounds formed strong intermolecular bonds with critical residues Val38, Ala51, Lys53, Thr106, Leu108, Met109 and Phe169.

For example, the information if a room is unoccupied can be used for automatically switching off the light, air conditioning, and ventilation, thereby saving significant amounts of energy in public buildings. Most existing solutions rely on dedicated hardware installations, which involve presence sensors, video cameras, and carbon dioxide sensors. Unfortunately, such approaches are costly, are subject to privacy concerns, have high computational requirements, and lack ubiquitousness. The work presented in this article addresses these limitations by proposing a low-cost occupancy detection system. Our approach builds upon detecting variations in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals related to the presence of humans. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by performing comprehensive tests on five different datasets. We apply several pattern recognition models and compare our methodology with systems building upon IEEE 802.11 (WiFi). On average, in multifarious environments, we can correctly classify the occupancy with an accuracy of 97.97%. When estimating the number of people in a room, on average, the estimated number of subjects differs from the actual one by 0.32 persons. We conclude that our system's performance is comparable to that of existing ones based on WiFi, while significantly reducing cost and installation effort. Hence, our approach makes occupancy detection practical for real-world deployments.","output":"Estimating indoor occupancy through low-cost BLE devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Despite federal legislation requiring youth engagement in their transition planning, students with disabilities continue to be passive partners in this transition process, under informed about the process and future possibilities, and with goals misaligned with their hopes. Students with specific disabilities and those who are English learners, Black, Indigenous, and from communities of color are even more impacted by the lack of active opportunities to provide direction on their futures. Method: The authors conducted a scoping literature review of youth engagement in the transition process for students served under Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Results: A shift towards active engagement for students in the transition process is critical. Inequitable experiences in that process exist for students based on individual and environmental characteristics. Active engagement will require direct, deliberate instruction and amelioration of structural barriers.

The existing risk assessment methods are limited by the real time and accuracy of data. Most of them take the administrative statistical unit as the analysis scale, which has modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) . First, based on a random forest method, we integrated COVID-19 transmission data at community scale and multisource geospatial data to map COVID-19 disease outbreak risks at fine scale. The experimental results (overall accuracy = 0.85, Kappa = 0.70) indicated the feasibility of the model. Second, we built a spatial variable-infection risk model at community and place scale to assess the risk degree of epidemic spread in different places and facilities. Last, we analyzed the possibly spatial drivers of disease transmission. The results show that (1) the central area of Wuhan city has the highest risk of infection and the risk map presents a trend of decreasing from the center to the periphery;(2) The top five facilities with the highest risk of COVID- 19 infection are shopping, medical, financial, transportation and public facilities;(3) The transmission risk of the epidemic is low in primary and middle schools, but high in colleges and universities;(4) The model determines the degree of epidemic risk at the community scale and predicts that shopping and traffic places are two most significant driving factors with the epidemic outbreak. In conclusion, this study suggests a new method of disease risk assessment based on a fine scale, which can pave the way for future disease risk assessment. ? 2021 Science Press.

COVID-19 has infected more than 29 million people and caused more than 900 thousand deaths at the time of writing. Since it is highly contagious, it causes explosive community transmission. Thus, health care delivery has been disrupted and compromised by the lack of testing kits. COVID-19-infected patients show severe acute respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile, the scientific community has been involved in the implementation of deep learning (DL) techniques to diagnose COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) lung scans, since CT is a pertinent screening tool due to its higher sensitivity in recognizing early pneumonic changes. However, large datasets of CT-scan images are not publicly available due to privacy concerns and obtaining very accurate models has become difficult. Thus, to overcome this drawback, transfer-learning pre-trained models are used in the proposed methodology to classify COVID-19 (positive) and COVID-19 (negative) patients. We describe the development of a DL framework that includes pre-trained models (DenseNet201, VGG16, ResNet50V2, and MobileNet) as its backbone, known as KarNet. To extensively test and analyze the framework, each model was trained on original (i.e. unaugmented) and manipulated (i.e. augmented) datasets. Among the four pre-trained models of KarNet, the one that used DenseNet201 demonstrated excellent diagnostic ability, with AUC scores of 1.00 and 0.99 for models trained on unaugmented and augmented data sets, respectively. Even after considerable distortion of the images (i.e. the augmented dataset) DenseNet201 achieved an accuracy of 97% for the test dataset, followed by ResNet50V2, MobileNet, and VGG16 (which achieved accuracies of 96%, 95%, and 94%, respectively).","output":"COVID-19 detection from lung CT-scan images using transfer learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had wide-reaching primary and secondary health implications. The UK government implemented a national lockdown to slow the rate of infection at the end of March 2020, lasting until early summer 2020. The results from a UK nationwide survey suggest the majority of inflammatory bowel disease patients were followed up using technology-enabled care services (TECS) during this time. We therefore aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on nutritional status of children with inflammatory bowel disease, focusing on the effect of national lockdown from March to early summer 2020. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. All patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, aged <18 years, and under the care of Southampton Children's Hospital were eligible for inclusion. Those patients who attended an outpatient appointment during time period 1 (November 2019 to February 2020), and following the period of national lockdown, time period 2 (July to November 2020), were included in the analysis. RESULTS: In total, 116 patients had paired measures. Using the World Health Organization criteria of nutritional status, 19% (n = 22/116) were mildly malnourished with a body mass index Z score (BMIZ) < -1. In this group, the mean BMIZ was -1.3  0.9 at time point 1 versus -1.9  0.9 at time point 2 (p = 0.03). The mean BMIZ score of those children who were overweight at time point 1 was 1.2  1.2 versus 1.6  1.4 at time point 2 (p = 0.2) During the period of lockdown, 27% of malnourished children (n = 6/22), 2% of normally nourished children (BMIZ > -1 to < 1) (n = 1/51) (p &#8804; 0.0001) and none of the overweight children (BMIZ > 1) (n = 0/43) children (p &#8804; 0.0001) had a TECS nutrition review. CONCLUSIONS: Dietetic reviews were severely restricted during the first national lockdown. Patients with low BMIZ prior to lockdown became more malnourished.

This paper reports the findings of a study that examines the representation of migrants and refugees and their health in the Indian print media prior to the pandemic. A secondary objective was to examine any variations in their representation based on their social positions (for example, ethnicity, nationality, gender, religion). Using frame and content analyses, three English language newspapers were examined for the period January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. A total of 1,111 articles were retrieved. Analysis revealed that migrants were most frequently framed as \\"villains\\", posing a threat to the security, culture, health and economy in their destination states/cities, and less often as victims. On health coverage, the study found that the media frequently pathologised migrants and projected them as carriers of infection. Migrants' religion, ethnicity and class, and their proximity to the majoritarian population appeared most prominent in determining the frame imposed. The articles mostly relied on accounts of state officials and political leaders, whereas migrants' voices comprised less than a quarter of the sources of information. The media thus play a vital role in crystallising these disparities and, through acts of both omission and commission, end up vilifying migrants.","output":"Victims, villains and the rare hero: Analysis of migrant and refugee health portrayals in the Indian print media."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken created opportunities in various areas of life, but also created new challenges or increased existing ones, which can also have a (direct or indirect) impact on health and well-being of the population or certain population groups.

We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. METHODS: We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction sample for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, 1 tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with from the chalet a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored; all contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 73) were negative. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence in this cluster of 1 asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children.

Methods: We employed a kinome siRNA library to screen whether targeting any kinases could increase the chemosensitivity of TNBC cell lines. The effects of kinase on cell viability in various breast cancer cells were validated with ATP level and colony formation. Protein expression and phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was collected to analyze the correlation of Src expression with prognosis of TNBC patients. Results: Primary screening and validation for the initial hits showed that Src kinase was a potential doxorubicin-resistant kinase in the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T. Both siRNA against Src and the Src inhibitor dasatinib enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in TNBC cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), downstream effectors of Src, were accordingly decreased in Src-silenced or -inhibited TNBC cells. Additionally, TCGA data analysis indicated that Src expression levels in tumor tissues were higher than those in tumor-adjacent normal tissues in patients with TNBC. High co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was also significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients.

While prior work has leveraged abrupt shifts in single policies to examine the effects of state policy on birth outcomes, we examined a holistic measure that captures political polarisation. METHODS Data were drawn from national birth certificates for 2003-2017 (N=56 770 470). Outcomes included preterm birth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age and other perinatal health measures. The primary exposure was a composite index of right-left state policy orientation, generated from historical data on 135 state policies. Multivariable regressions were used to estimate the association between state policy orientation and each outcome, adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS Compared with infants born in states with right-leaning policy orientations, those born in left-leaning states had lower odds of adverse birth outcomes (eg, low birth weight: OR 0.95 (0.93, 0.97), preterm birth: OR 0.94 (0.92, 0.95)). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations for US-born and White mothers. With the inclusion of state fixed effects, left-leaning policy orientation was no longer associated with lower odds of adverse birth outcomes. Models were otherwise robust to alternative specifications. CONCLUSION While left-leaning state policy orientation has protective associations with a range of birth outcomes, the associations may be explained by stable characteristics of states, at least during the study period.

Here we analyse an extended SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, believed to play an important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we derive a number of analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of infections, the time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected population. We also propose an accurate way of specifying initial conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the fact that the early time exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number, R 0 , to a target value R 0 target < 1 , but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same R 0 target < 1 , TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and our study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics provides a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries.

Higher resilience was associated with greater use of adaptive coping behaviors and less use of maladaptive coping behaviors. The use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more stress. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that resilience was the strongest unique predictor of stress, thus, largely accounting for the observed coping-outcome associations. Individual differences in resilience levels moderated the effects of two coping strategies (planning and self-blame) on stress. Specifically, planning was associated with increased levels of stress for people with low resilience. In contrast, high personal resilience attenuated the negative effect of self-blame on their stress levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that resilience is critical for coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future approaches for augmenting resilience could prove to be important potential interventions to help support older adults navigating stressful situations as well as lessen adverse effects on neurocognitive and mental health in the future.","output":"Stress, resilience, and coping strategies in a sample of community-dwelling older adults during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This systematic and meta-review aimed to compare clinical presentation, outcomes, and care management among patients with COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic.

They contain a cargo of lipids, proteins, and RNA. They can transfer their content to not only cells in the vicinity but also to cells at a distance. This unique ability empowers them to modulate the physiology of recipient cells. In brain, exosomes play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ABSTRACT: Exosomes of endosomal origin are one class of extracellular vesicles that are important in intercellular communication. Exosomes are released by all cells in our body and their cargo consisting of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids has a footprint reflective of their parental origin. The exosomal cargo has the power to modulate the physiology of recipient cells in the vicinity of the releasing cells or cells at a distance. Harnessing the potential of exosomes relies upon the purity of exosome preparation. Hence, many methods for isolation have been developed and we provide a succinct summary of several methods. In spite of the seclusion imposed by the bloodCbrain barrier, cells in the CNS are not immune from exosomal intrusive influences. Both neurons and glia release exosomes, often in an activity-dependent manner. A brief description of exosomes released by different cells in the brain and their role in maintaining CNS homeostasis is provided. The hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of protein aggregates. Recent studies implicate exosomes intercellular communicator role in the spread of misfolded proteins aiding the propagation of pathology. In this review, we discuss the potential contributions made by exosomes in progression of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Understanding contributions made by exosomes in pathogenesis of neurodegeneration opens the field for employing exosomes as therapeutic agents for drug delivery to brain since exosomes do cross the bloodCbrain barrier.","output":"Small but MightyExosomes, Novel Intercellular Messengers in Neurodegeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since May 2020, the first nasopharyngeal POC tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic have been available. Due to the long passage through the nasal cavity, there is a risk of injury with subsequent epistaxis. METHODS: We describe the course of disease of two female patients who suffered from massive epistaxis requiring intervention after an externally performed nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: After nasal tamponade, one patient underwent clipping of the sphenopalatine artery under general anesthesia. The other patient suffered from nasal bleeding with hemorrhagic shock requiring transfusion. She was intubated and admitted to our hospital. CONCLUSION: The nasopharyngeal swab for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to life-threatening complications in rare cases. Considering that daily more than 5 million corona tests are being carried out worldwide as part of the current pandemic, complications should not be neglected. It is necessary that the person performing the swab has a detailed understanding of the anatomy involved. Alternative test methods were further assessed with regard to their sensitivity. With regard to the future need for SARS-CoV-2 tests, alternative and lower-risk test procedures must be investigated and established.","output":"[Epistaxis Requiring Intervention After Swab for SARS-CoV-2]./ Interventionsbedrftige Epistaxis nasi nach SARS-CoV-2-Abstrich"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents my thinking and concerns about formation of COVID-19 policy Policy formation must cope with substantial uncertainties about the nature of the disease, the dynamics of transmission, and behavioral responses Data uncertainties limit our knowledge of the past trajectory and current state of the pandemic Data and modeling uncertainties limit our ability to predict the impacts of alternative policies I explain why current epidemiological and macroeconomic modeling cannot deliver realistically optimal policy I describe my recent work quantifying basic data uncertainties that make policy analysis difficult I discuss approaches for policy choice under uncertainty and suggest adaptive policy diversification","output":"Forming COVID-19 Policy Under Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has varied greatly across the United States, there has been little assessment of hospital resources and mortality.

The evaluation methodology was designed to assess contribution of the Partnership in accordance with its vision of improving child health sustainably through education and training. Domains for assessment were based on established determinants of effectiveness for GHPs1 2 and included shared vision and goals, commitment to joint learning, sustainable, accountable, respectful, reciprocal and responsible.A mixed-methods approach was adopted using quantitative questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and focus groups at both sites. Questions were written in consultation with the QECH team to ensure they were appropriate to the local context and to reduce communication barriers. Questions focused on specific Partnership education and training activities including bi-directional exchanges, specialty teaching visits and the Paediatric Assessment Skills (PAS) course.Operational planning involved input from both organisations, scheduling interviews to ensure representative numbers from all multi-professional staff groups, avoiding disruption to clinical care and ensuring interview techniques were empathetic and allowed equitable access to all voices. Practical measures included recruiting an evaluation team with previous knowledge of the artnership, timely advertising of the evaluation, organising rooms and timetabling staff for interviews, sourcing equipment, arranging travel itinerary and accommodation.ResultsA quantitative questionnaire consisting of nine closed-answer and Likert scale questions was devised, as well as thirteen questions for the semi-structured individual interviews, to complete in fifteen minutes. Mock interviews were conducted to test for understanding and time management.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a digital questionnaire method of evaluation was used for interviewing BWC.All aspects of the design and implementation was completed in time for the evaluation.

Situations like physical distancing as well as being constantly tagged as the most vulnerable group could expose older adults to mental and psychosocial burdens. Nonetheless, there is little clarity about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar pandemics in the past on the mental illness, wellbeing, and psychosocial health of the older population compared to other age groups. Objectives: To describe the patterns of older adults' mental and psychosocial health related to acute respiratory disease propagated-type epidemics and pandemics and to evaluate the differences with how other age groups respond. Eligibility criteria: quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating mental illness, wellbeing, or psychosocial health outcomes associated with respiratory propagated epidemics and pandemics exposure or periods (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza) in people 65 years or older. Data source: Original articles published until June 1st, 2020, in any language searched in the electronic healthcare and social sciences database: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, WHO Global literature on coronavirus disease database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( - CNKI). Furthermore, EPPI Centre's COVID-19 living systematic map and the publicly available publication list of the COVID-19 living systematic review will be incorporated for preprints and recent COVID-19 publications. Data extraction: Two independent reviewers will extract predefined parameters. The risk of bias will be assessed. Data synthesis: Data synthesis will be performed according to study type and design, type of epidemic and pandemic, types of outcomes (mental health and psychosocial outcomes), and participant characteristics (e.g., sex, race, age, socioeconomic status, food security, presence of dependency in daily life activities independent/dependent older adults). Comparison between sex, race, and other age groups will be performed qualitatively, and quantitatively if enough data is available. The risk of bias and study heterogeneity will be reported for quantitative studies. Conclusion: This study will provide information to take actions to address potential mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults and to understand responses on this age group. Furthermore, it will be useful to identify potential groups that are more vulnerable or resilient to the mental-health challenges of the current worldwide pandemic.","output":"'Drawing on Wisdom to Cope with Adversity:' A Systematic Review Protocol of Older Adults' Mental and Psychosocial Health During Acute Respiratory Disease Propagated-Type Epidemics and Pandemics (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The catastrophic emergency experienced by many countries with the COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the importance of bioethics for decision-making, both at the public health (equitable and effective policies) and at the clinical level.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS Two-hundred surgeries performed from May 1, 2018 to March 1, 2020 and stratified as intubated, intermittently intubated (AAIV) or apneic. Patient demographics, comorbidities, anesthetic agents, intraoperative parameters/events, and complications were studied and compared across the three groups using inferential analyses. RESULTS Median body mass index in the AAIV group was significantly higher (33 vs. 29; P = .0117). Median oxygen nadirs were lower in AAIV cases (81% vs. 91-92%) while CO2 peak measurements were lower (33 mmHg vs. 48 mmHg) in the fully apneic cohort which were significantly shorter cases (P < .0001). CO2 peak measurements were comparable between AAIV and intubated cohorts (median 48.5 mmHg vs. 48.0 mmHg). Median apnea times were significantly prolonged by 2-5.5 minutes using nasal cannula and THRIVE/Optiflow in fully apneic cases when compared to no supplementary oxygenation (P = .0013). Systolic blood pressures following insertion of laryngoscope were higher (159.5 vs. 145 mmHg) and postoperative diastolic pressures were lower (68.5 vs. 76.5 mmHg) in fully apneic cases than intubated cases. No differences existed between frequencies of complications. CONCLUSIONS This study compares intubated, intermittently apneic, and fully apneic surgeries. No statistically significant differences were noted in comorbid conditions. While intraoperative hemodynamic fluctuations were more pronounced in the fully apneic cohort, and oxygenation distributions were lower in the AAIV cohort, no significant differences existed between events and complications.

Loneliness and social isolation were measured using the UCLA-3 Loneliness Scale and the Social Network Index. Participants were grouped into four categories of loneliness and social isolation based on overlap, including: lonely only (L), socially isolated only (SI), both lonely and socially isolated (LSI), or neither (N). Outcomes included quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs. Among participants, 9.8% were considered L, 20.6% SI, 9.1% LSI, and 60.5% N. Respondents were primarily female (55.0%) and 70-74 years of age (27.1%). Those considered LSI were more likely to be older, female, less healthy, depressed, with lower quality of life and greater healthcare utilization patterns. Participants who were L or LSI had higher rates of emergency room visits compared to the N group; LSI had the highest medical costs. Results demonstrate the cumulative effects of loneliness and social isolation among older adults.

OBJECTIVE: To unravel the most challenging aspects of COVID-19 in a nonclinical adult population and identify predictors of lost balance and consequent allostatic overload (AO). We examined the role of regular, moderate-intensity formula aerobic exercise (312 meridian exercise) in preventing allostatic overload through increasing well-being. METHODS: An online survey was conducted to measure CO-VID-related allostatic overload according to clinimetric criteria. The Psychosocial Index (PSI), Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ), short Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale -(PHS-WB), and Whiteley-7 were used to explore mental health characteristics. Univariate statistics logistic regression analysis and a general linear model were used. RESULTS: According to 442 valid answers, 217 adults practiced physical exercise (PE) frequently (fPE, 3-5 times/every day) while 120 did it less regularly (1-2 times/week), and 105 did not exercise/practiced irregularly (controls). Restriction-related stressors were most challenging, resulting in AO in 29% (n = 128) of the sample. The main predictors were additional stressors (p = 0.005) and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001). The prevalence of AO was lower (p = 0.018) in the fPE group when compared to controls. KSQ distress symptoms were also lower in fPE (p < 0.0001), while total well-being was increased (p < 0.001) after adjusting for sex, age, and number of chronic diseases. According to the PHS-WB, both physical and mental well-being were higher (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively) in fPE.

The nsp2 protein domain resides in a region of the coronavirus replicase that is relatively nonconserved across coronaviruses. In fact, the size and amino acid sequence variability of nsp2 across the different coronaviruses has led some investigators to speculate that the nsp2 protein, along with the nsp1 and nsp3 proteins, may play host- and/or cell-specific roles in the virus life cycle. While this may be the case, it should be noted that nsp2, in some form, exists in all coronaviruses studied to date and likely plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle. A previous study from our laboratory identified a coronavirus replicase protein that plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. Such may prove to be the case for nsp2, as well. Alternatively, beacuse nsp2 exists as a detectable precursor protein nsp2-3 prior to processing of nsp2 and nsp3 into mature proteins, nsp2 may play a critical adaptor/regulatory role for nsp3 function.

Veterinary pathologists are familiar with coronavirus infections in animals, and now more than ever this knowledge and understanding, based on many years of veterinary research, could provide valuable answers for our medical colleagues. Here I review the early research on CRCoV where seroprevalence, early immune response, and pathogenesis are some of the same key questions being asked by scientists globally during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"Canine Respiratory Coronavirus: A Naturally Occurring Model of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mediated by the binding of its spike protein to the membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The understanding of RAS dysregulation due to this viral infection is of fundamental importance to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, and to design effective therapeutic strategies. To address this issue, we built a mathematical model of RAS based on data about protein and peptide concentrations in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. We first tested our model on clinical data on the action of antihypertensive RAS-blocking drugs in control individuals. Despite the simplicity of our model, it reproduces very well, without any fitting of additional parameters, the impact of a series of drugs, i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), direct renin inhibitors (DRI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). We applied our model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the RAS system, which we modeled through a downregulation of ACE2 related to viral load. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of RAS-blockers and other RAS-targeting drugs, i.e. human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) and angiotensin 1-7 peptide (Ang1-7), on the RAS system of normotensive and hypertensive COVID-19 patients. We found that while ACE-I, DRI, rhACE2 and Ang1-7 tend to improve the clinical outcomes in a tension-dependent manner, the use of ARB appears to worsen it. The mathematical model that we developed offers the interesting possibility of testing in silico the RAS dysregulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and of predicting how risk factors as well as different drugs, alone or in combination, impact on RAS and disease severity.","output":"Modeling the molecular impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the renin-angiotensin system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have limited knowledge about adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of educational intervention on the knowledge of hospital pharmacists about ADRs. METHODS: This was a 3-month randomized controlled trial conducted in Saudi Arabia between January 2018 and March 2018. Participants in both groups were required to complete an online questionnaire at baseline and at 12-week follow-up. Participants in the intervention group received a structured information sheet about ADRs 2 weeks after the first assessment. The main outcome measure was difference in mean knowledge score about ADRs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference in mean knowledge score about ADRs. RESULTS: A total of 46 participants were included in the study. At the 12-week follow-up, there was a significant improvement in the mean knowledge score ( standard deviation) of intervention participants from 7.67 ( 2.1) at baseline to 11.22 ( 0.4) (95% CI ?4.5 to ?2.5; p < 0.0001).

Therapeutic options including antivirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, and vaccines are still under study. Convalescent plasma(CP) immunotherapy was an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. In the epidemic of COVID-19, a large number of literatures reported the application of CP. However, there is controversy over the efficacy of CP therapy for COVID-19. This systematic review was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to CP immunotherapy for COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Clinical Key, Wanfang Database; China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) were used to search for the proper keywords such as SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, plasma, serum, immunoglobulins, blood transfusion, convalescent, novel coronavirus, immune and the related words for publications published until 15.10.2020. Other available resources were also used to identify relevant articles. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 45 articles were included in the final review. First, meta-analysis results of RCTs showed that, there were no statistically significant differences between CP transfusion and the control group in terms of reducing mortality(OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52-1.19, I2 = 28%) and improving clinical symptoms(OR 1.21, 95%CI 0.68-2.16; I2 = 0%). The results of controlled NRSIs showed that CP therapy may reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients(RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.53-0.66, I2 = 0%). Second, limited safety data suggested that CP is a well-tolerated therapy with a low incidence of adverse events. But, due to lack of safety data for the control group, it is really not easy to determine whether CP transfusion has an impact on moderate to serious AEs. Thirdly, for children, pregnant, elderly, tumor and immunocompromised patients, CP may be a well-tolerated therapy, if the disease cannot be controlled and continues to progress. Studies were commonly of low or very low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of limited RCTs showed that CP cannot significantly reduce mortality, some non-RCTs and case report(series) have found that CP may help patients improve clinical symptoms, clear the virus, and reduce mortality, especially for patients with COVID-19 within ten days of illness. We speculate that CP may be a possible treatment option. High-quality studies are needed for establishing stronger quality of evidence and pharmacists should also be actively involved in the CP treatment process and provide close pharmaceutical care.","output":"Convalescent plasma may be a possible treatment for COVID-19: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uncertain. Available evidence is limited to a few retrospective observational studies with small number of patients. Methods: We did a meta-analysis to assess the effect of ACEi/ARB in patients with COVID-19 on severity of disease, risk for hospitalisation, and death compared to those not on ACEi/ARB. We searched the Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and medRxiv for studies published until 21.04.2020. Inclusion criteria included all studies with patients with confirmed COVID-19 either taking, or not taking, ACEi/ARB. Depending on degree of heterogeneity, fixed or random effect model was selected to calculate effect size (Odds ratio). Findings: Five studies were eligible for meta-analysis. These included 308 patients on ACEi/ARB, and 1172 not on ACEi/ARB. Compared to patients with COVID-19 not on ACEi/ARB, there was a statistically significant 44% reduction in odds of developing severe disease (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34-1.89, I2=68.15), and 62% reduction in odds of death (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.19-0.74, I2=0.000) in those on ACEi/ARB. There was a non-significant 19% (OR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.42-1.55, I2: 0.000) reduction in odds of hospitalisation among those on ACEi/ARB. Interpretation: It is safe to use ACEi/ARB in patients with COVID-19 requiring these medications for associated comorbidities. Although limited by confounding factors typical of a meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies, our data suggests that use of these medications may reduce risk of developing severe disease and death.

As an example, the messenger app WhatsApp was adopted by both the World Health Organization and government agencies to provide updates on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). During a time when rumors and excessive news threaten psychological well-being, these services allow for rapid transmission of information and may boost resilience. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to accomplish the following: (1) assess well-being during the pandemic; (2) replicate prior findings linking exposure to COVID-19 news with psychological distress; and (3) examine whether subscription to an official WhatsApp channel can mitigate this risk. METHODS: Across 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak (March 7 to April 21, 2020), we conducted a survey of 1145 adults in Singapore. As the primary outcome measure, participants completed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As predictor variables, participants also answered questions pertaining to the following: (1) their exposure to COVID-19 news; (2) their use of the Singapore government's WhatsApp channel; and (3) their demographics. RESULTS: Within the sample, 7.9% of participants had severe or extremely severe symptoms on at least one DASS-21 subscale. Depression scores were associated with increased time spent receiving COVID-19 updates, whereas use of the official WhatsApp channel emerged as a protective factor (b=-0.07, t[863]=-2.04, P=.04). Similarly, increased anxiety scores were associated with increased exposure to both updates and rumors, but this risk was mitigated by trust in the government's WhatsApp messages (b=-0.05, t[863]=-2.13, P=.03). Finally, although stress symptoms increased with the amount of time spent receiving updates, these symptoms were not significantly related to WhatsApp use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that messenger apps may be an effective medium for disseminating pandemic-related information, allowing official agencies to reach a broad sector of the population rapidly.

Recent direct detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas13a avoid reverse transcription and DNA amplification required of gold-standard PCR assays, but these assays have not yet achieved the sensitivity of PCR and are not easily multiplexed to detect multiple viruses or variants. Here we show that Cas13a acting on single target RNAs loaded into droplets exhibits stochastic nuclease activity that can be used to enable sensitive, rapid, and multiplexed virus quantification. Using SARS-CoV-2 RNA as the target and combinations of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that recognize different parts of the viral genome, we demonstrate that reactions confined to small volumes can rapidly achieve PCR-level sensitivity. By tracking nuclease activity within individual droplets over time, we find that Cas13a exhibits rich kinetic behavior that depends on both the target RNA and crRNA. We demonstrate that these kinetic signatures can be harnessed to differentiate between different human coronavirus species as well as SARS-CoV-2 variants within a single droplet. The combination of high sensitivity, short reaction times, and multiplexing makes this droplet-based Cas13a assay with kinetic barcoding a promising strategy for direct RNA identification and quantification.","output":"Sensitive and multiplexed RNA detection with Cas13 droplets and kinetic barcoding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epigenetics related to the various pathways which show long-term impacts on the gene expression patterns without alterations in nucleotide sequences.

The aims of this study were to determine the effect of sialic acid binding for the infection of cultured cells under unfavorable conditions, and comparison of TGEV strains and mutants, as well as the avian coronavirus IBV concerning their dependence on the sialic acid binding activity. METHODS: The infectivity of different viruses was analyzed by a plaque assay after adsorption times of 5, 20, and 60 min. Prior to infection, cultured cells were either treated with neuraminidase to deplete sialic acids from the cell surface, or mock-treated. In a second approach, pre-treatment of the virus with porcine intestinal mucin was performed, followed by the plaque assay after a 5 min adsorption time. A student's t-test was used to verify the significance of the results. RESULTS: Desialylation of cells only had a minor effect on the infection by TGEV strain Purdue 46 when an adsorption period of 60 min was allowed for initiation of infection. However, when the adsorption time was reduced to 5 min the infectivity on desialylated cells decreased by more than 60%. A TGEV PUR46 mutant (HAD3) deficient in sialic acid binding showed a 77% lower titer than the parental virus after a 5 min adsorption time. After an adsorption time of 60 min the titer of HAD3 was 58% lower than that of TGEV PUR46. Another TGEV strain, TGEV Miller, and IBV Beaudette showed a reduction in infectivity after neuraminidase treatment of the cultured cells irrespective of the virion adsorption time.

RESULTS: Two window periods (March and April 2019 and 2020) were chosen for comparison. Endoscopic diagnostic procedures and major resections for early stage NSCLC patients increased at Center 1, where a priority pathway with dedicated personnel was established for cancer patients. A slight decrease was observed at Center 2 which became part of the COVID unit. Personnel shortage and different processing methods of tumor samples determined a slightly longer time for diagnostic pathway completion at both Centers. Personnel protection strategies led to a MDT reshape on a web basis and to a significant selection of cases to be discussed in both Centers. The optimization of patient access to healthcare units reduced first outpatient oncological visits, patient enrollment in clinical trials, and end-of-life cancer systemic treatments; finally, a higher proportion of hypofractionation was delivered as a radiotherapy approach for early stage and locally advanced NSCLC.

Existing DQM schemes often cannot satisfactorily improve ML performance because, by design, they are oblivious to downstream ML tasks. Besides, they cannot handle various data quality issues (especially those caused by adversarial attacks) and have limited applications to only certain types of ML models. Recently, data valuation approaches (e.g., based on the Shapley value) have been leveraged to perform DQM; yet, empirical studies have observed that their performance varies considerably based on the underlying data and training process.

METHODS: Our study was based on the first month of publicly accessible data on new confirmed daily cases. A susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model for COVID-19 was employed to compare the current dynamics of the disease with those predicted under various scenarios. RESULTS: The fitted model for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Bali indicated an effective reproduction number of 1.4.

Families described staying home and stopping all external activities. Three themes relating to family interactions and wellbeing were found: enhanced family relationships; prompted reflection on family schedules; and increased parental stress. Two themes related to family device use were found: enabled connections to be maintained; and source of disrupted interactions within the family unit. Overall, participants described more advantages than downsides of device use during COVID-19.

Hence, we established the hypothesis that a new immune system exists that forms before birth and decreases with aging. Methods: To prove this hypothesis, we established new ex-vivo culture conditions simulating the critical environmental factors of fetal stem cells (FSCs) in early pregnancy. Then, we analyzed the components from FSCs cultivated newly developed ex-vivo culture conditions and compared them from FSCs cultured in a normal condition. Results: We demonstrated that immunoglobulin M (IgM), a natural antibody (NAb) produced only in early B-1 cells, immunoglobulins (Igs) including IgG3, which has a wide range of antigen-binding capacity and affinity, complement proteins, and antiviral proteins are induced in FSCs only cultured in newly developed ex-vivo culture conditions. Particularly we confirmed that their extracellular vesicles (EVs) contained NAbs, Igs, various complement proteins, and antiviral proteins, as well as human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), responsible for immune tolerance. Conclusion: Our results suggest that FSCs in early pregnancy can form an independent immune system responding to unlearned antigens as a self-defense mechanism before establishing mature immune systems. Moreover, we propose the possibility of new solutions to cope with various infectious diseases based on the factors in NAbs-containing EVs, especially not causing unnecessary immune reaction due to HLA-G.","output":"The Different Immune Responses by Age Are due to the Ability of the Fetal Immune System to Secrete Primal Immunoglobulins Responding to Unexperienced Antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quarantine plays a key role in controlling the pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study investigated (a) the associations between mandatory quarantine status and negative cognitions (perceived discrimination because of COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection)/mental health status (emotional distress because of COVID-19, probable depression, and self-harm/suicidal ideation), (b) the associations between the negative cognitions and mental health status, and (c) potential mediations between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 24,378 students of 26 universities in 16 Chinese cities (February 1-10, 2020). Correlation coefficients, odds ratios (OR), structural equation modeling, and other statistics were used for data analysis. Mandatory quarantined status was significantly and positively associated with perceived discrimination (Cohen's d = 0.62), perceived high/very high risk of infection (OR = 1.61), emotional distress (Cohen's d = 0.46), probable depression (OR = 2.54), and self-harm/suicidal ideation (OR = 4.98). Perceived discrimination was moderately and positively associated with emotional distress (Spearman correlation = 0.44). Associations between perceived risk of infection and mental health variables were significant but relatively weak. Cross-sectional mediation models showed good model fit, but the overall indirect paths via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress only accounted for 12-15% of the total effects between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation. In conclusion, quarantined participants were more likely than others to perceive discrimination and exhibit mental distress. It is important to integrate mental health care into the planning and implementation of quarantine measures. Future longitudinal studies to explore mechanisms underlying the mental health impact of quarantines are warranted.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) function as crucial regulatory factors in EndoMT. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of circRNA HECW2 (circ_HECW2, hsa_circ_0057583) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced EndoMT remain largely unclear. The levels of circ_HECW2, miR-30e-5p and neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Ribonuclease (RNase) R and Actinomycin D assays were performed to validate the stability of circ_HECW2. Cell colony formation, proliferation and apoptosis were tested by a standard colony formation assay, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Targeted relationships among circ_HECW2, miR-30e-5p and NEGR1 were verified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our data indicated that LPS increased circ_HECW2 expression and reduced miR-30e-5p expression in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Circ_HECW2 silencing promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cell apoptosis and EndoMT in LPS-treated HBMECs. Mechanistically, circ_HECW2 directly interacted with miR-30e-5p by binding to miR-30e-5p. MiR-30e-5p was a functional mediator of circ_HECW2 in regulating LPS-induced cell EndoMT. Furthermore, Circ_HECW2 regulated NEGR1 expression through functioning as a miR-30e-5p sponge. Moreover, miR-30e-5p overexpression repressed the EndoMT of LPS-treated HBMECs by targeting NEGR1. Collectively, our current study demonstrated that circ_HECW2 silencing suppressed LPS-triggered HBMEC EndoMT at least in part through the regulation of the miR-30e-5p/NEGR1 axis, illuminating a promising strategy for EndoMT inhibition.","output":"Circ_HECW2 functions as a miR-30e-5p sponge to regulate LPS-induced endothelial-mesenchymal transition by mediating NEGR1 expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The model of higher education institutions has remained widely unchallenged over time.

Since the advent of this last epidemic, several NHP species, including the baboon, have been utilized for modeling and understanding the complications of ZIKV infection in humans; several health issues related to the outcome of infection have not been resolved yet and require further investigation. This study was designed to validate, in baboons, the molecular signatures that have previously been identified in ZIKV-infected humans and macaque models. We performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of baboons during acute ZIKV infection, including flow cytometry, cytokine, immunological, and transcriptomic analyses. We show here that, similar to most human cases, ZIKV infection of male baboons tends to be subclinical, but is associated with a rapid and transient antiviral interferon-based response signature that induces a detectable humoral and cell-mediated immune response. This immunity against the virus protects animals from challenge with a divergent ZIKV strain, as evidenced by undetectable viremia but clear anamnestic responses.

His rule adds nine months and seven days to the first day of the last menstrual period. The expected date of confinement from this formula is approximately right in the majority of cases. However, the idea that this rule can apply to every pregnant female - young or old, nulliparous or multigravida, Caucasian, Asian, African, or Indigenous - stretches credulity. In addition, many women regard the 40-week date as a deadline, which if crossed, may then place the baby under stress. Forty weeks is such a simple, round, convenient figure that it has proved difficult to challenge, despite criticism. Nonetheless, what might have been an appropriate formula in Germany in the 19th century deserves to be revisited in the 21st.

Most (72%) of the articles came from the United States of America, three from the United Kingdom, and one each from Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Most articles were descriptive in nature. Some variations in methods emerged. CONCLUSION PAs are operational in 15 nations; their acceptance appears successful and satisfaction with their care largely indistinguishable from physicians. Findings from this analysis highlight one theory that when patient's needs are met, satisfaction is high regardless of the medical provider. Areas for further research are identified.","output":"Patient satisfaction with physician assistant/associate care: an international scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. are important pathogens causing diarrhea in humans and animals. However, few studies have been conducted on the infection of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. in peafowl up to now. The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence and the involved genotypes of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi in peafowl in Beijing and Jiangxi Province, China. In total, 258 peafowl fecal samples were collected. Overall, both Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi had the same prevalence, i.e. 6.59% (17/258). Higher infection rates of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. were found in the adolescent peafowl. The prevalence of E. bieneusi in Beijing and Jiangxi Province was 5.23% and 8.57% respectively. For Cryptosporidium spp., the prevalence was 4.58% and 9.52% in Beijing and Jiangxi Province, respectively. Three zoonotic genotypes of E. bieneusi were confirmed, including two known genotypes, genotype Peru 6 and D, and one novel genotype, JXP1. Two avian specific species/genotypes of Cryptosporidium, Avian genotype  and Goose genotype , were identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. occurrence in peafowl in China. The findings suggest that peafowl could be reservoirs of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. which could be potentially transmitted to humans and other animals, and the present survey have implications for controlling E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. infection in peafowl.","output":"First report of Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. in peafowl (Pavo cristatus) in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has instigated tremendous human and economic hardship around the world. Using meta-literature and time series analysis, we conduct both synthesis and empirical analysis to investigate particularly the economic perspectives of COVID-19 across several financial systems: (a) Asian market, (b) European market, (c) American market and (d) Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Middle East and North Africa?s (MENA) market. The critical review of the leading business and finance journals of ISI-WOS summarizes that the outburst of COVID-19 mercilessly affects global economies;however, the end phase of the systematic cascading effect has not clearly folded yet. The probable reasons of economic downturn are productivity reduction, labour immobility, undue job loss, scarcity of employment opportunities, discontinuation of supply chain, declining foreign exports, investment uncertainty, adverse clientele effect, etc. However, after analysing the pre- and during COVID effect on foreign reserve and remittance, we identify an inconclusive finding: (a) bullish trend, (e.g., the USA, Canada, Mexico, Japan, India, Bangladesh and Singapore);(b) bearish trend, (e.g., the UK, Sri-Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Italy and Brazil). Our time series analysis between pre- and during COVID-19 also documents the economic mystery that although the overall economic growth has gone down, foreign reserve and remittance have increased gradually across several economies. Overall, the current global situation demands systematic, well-targeted and aggressive fiscal-monetary stimulus initiatives.

From the perspective of migration infrastructure, this paper specifically focuses on the immobility experiences amongst Chinese international students (CIS) who planned to enrol overseas in 2020 but instead chose to take online courses in China due to the COVID-19. It asks how online courses are both facilitated and constrained by a set of institutional and technological infrastructural forces. Particularly it also explores how some CIS exercise agency to mobilise their infrastructural surroundings and overcome certain infrastructural deficiencies they encounter, with the aim of improving studying/living quality while inhabiting immobilities in a transnational context. As such, this paper challenges the oppositional nature of mobility and immobility, arguing that immobility is not the flip side to mobility or an outcome by default, and that being immobile can be affirming and empowering. Essentially, the paper brings this infrastructurally sensitive theoretical approach into international student mobility (ISM) studies, shifting the focus from examining how infrastructures move people to how they enable people to stay, and to how they are lived and reconstructed at an everyday level.

TDD has made an important contribution to medical practice such as diabetes, hemorrhoids, arthritis, migraine, and schizophrenia treatment, but has yet to fully achieve its potential in the treatment of obesity. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally and posed a significant threat to human health. Various approaches, including oral and injection administration have widely been used in clinical setting for obesity treatment. However, these traditional options remain ineffective and inconvenient, and carry risks of adverse effects. Therefore, alternative and advanced drug delivery strategies with higher efficacy and less toxicity such as TDD are urgently required for obesity treatment. This review summarizes current TDD technology, and the main anti-obesity drug delivery system. This review also provides insights into various anti-obesity drugs under study with a focus on the recent developments of TDD system for enhanced anti-obesity drug delivery. Although most of presented studies stay in animal stage, the application of TDD in anti-obesity drugs would have a significant impact on bringing safe and effective therapies to obese patients in the future.","output":"Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems and Their Use in Obesity Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is twofold: first, to analyze whether the daily level of energy in terms of vigor at work could explain the way in which workers psychologically detach from their work, relax, practice challenging activities, and have the feeling of having control over their leisure time when arriving home. Second, to check if the daily emotional job demands could hinder that relationship, reversing the positive effect of vigor in recovery. For this purpose, a multilevel study with a diary methodology was designed. In total, 94 nurses from various hospital and primary care centers in Madrid and Basque Country (Spain) participated in this study. They completed daily questionnaires twice a day (in the afternoon after work and at night before going to bed) for five consecutive workdays from Monday to Friday (N = 94*5 = 470). The results revealed that on days that vigor at work was high, nurses experienced more psychological detachment, relaxation, feelings of mastery, and time control at home. Moreover, on days that emotional job demands were high, vigor was more negatively related to psychological detachment and time control at home. Additionally, vigor was more positively related to all recovery experiences at home in days that emotional demands were low. Therefore, daily vigor can act as an energy resource that helps the worker to recover. However, this effect can occur in situations in which stressors are not present in high intensity. These results have clear practical implications for both health organizations and workers.","output":"Overwhelmed by Emotional Job Demands in High Vigor Days!

However, some SOT centers are reluctant to administer GCs long-term because of the various related side effects. This review summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of GCs in SOT. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched from 2011 to April 2021 using search syntaxes covering transplantation and glucocorticoids. GCs are used in transplant recipients, transplant donors, and organ perfusate solution to improve transplant outcomes. In SOT recipients, GCs are administered as induction and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. GCs are also the cornerstone to treat acute antibody- and T-cell-mediated rejections. Addition of GCs to organ perfusate solution and pretreatment of transplant donors with GCs are recommended by some guidelines and protocols, to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury peri-transplant. GCs with low bioavailability and high potency for GC receptors, such as budesonide, nanoparticle-mediated targeted delivery of GCs to specific organs, and combination use of dexamethasone with inducers of immune-regulatory cells, are new methods of GC application in SOT patients to reduce side effects or induce immune-tolerance instead of immunosuppression. Various side effects involving different non-targeted organs/tissues, such as bone, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, skin and gastrointestinal tract, have been noted for GCs.

Their professional identity may affect whether they can actively participate and be competent in care tasks during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the level of and changes in professional identity of Chinese emergency and intensive care unit nurses as the COVID-19 pandemic builds. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey composed of the Professional Identity Scale for Nurses plus 2 open-ended questions was administered to Chinese emergency and intensive care unit nurses through an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Emergency and intensive care unit nurses had a medium level of professional identity. Participants' total and item mean scores in 5 professional identity dimensions were higher than the professional identity norm established by Liu (P < .001). The greatest mean item score difference was in the dimension of professional identity evaluation (3.57 vs 2.88, P < .001). When asked about their feelings witnessing the COVID-19 situation and their feelings about participating in frontline work, 68.9% and 83.9%, respectively, reported positive changes in their professional identity. CONCLUSIONS: The professional identity of emergency and intensive care unit nurses greatly improved during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several studies have shown that people those have skin-related problems are suffering from anxiety, sleeping problem, and hair diseases, etc. due to this COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, to assess the current situation of skincare patients, it is necessary to evaluate whether they need any surveillance or special attention. Objective: The objectives of this study to evaluate whether there are any significant changes in population interest for skincare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: For the skincare, weekly RSV data were extracted for worldwide and 23 counties between August 1, 2016, and August 31, 2020. Interrupted time-series analysis was conducted as the quasi-experimental approach to evaluate the longitudinal effects of COVID-19 skincare related search queries.

However, individuals who are exposed to environmental allergens are characterized by elevated values of FeNO. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) on the dynamics of FeNO determined during consecutive pollination seasons. METHODS This study, performed between 2005 and 2008, included 41 patients with confirmed sensitivity to grass pollens and predominating symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, randomly assigned to desensitization by preseasonal or maintenance SCIT. FeNO was measured prior to and during each pollen season (November-January and May-July, respectively). The results were conferred to data on grass pollination intensity in 2006-2008 (air concentration of grass pollen grains, seasonal number of days when air concentration of grass pollen reached at least 50 grains per 1 m(3)). RESULTS Median content of FeNO in exhaled air was significantly higher in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2008 pollen seasons. During 2007 and 2008 pollen seasons, significant increase in FeNO was observed compared to the respective preseasonal values. Median number of days with air concentration of grass pollen  50 grains per 1 m(3) of air during 4 weeks preceding seasonal FeNO measurement was significantly higher in 2007, corresponding to higher FeNO value recorded during this pollen season. However, no significant correlation was observed between seasonal number of days with  50 grass pollen grains per 1 m(3) of air and FeNO in exhaled air (r=0.09, p=0.362). CONCLUSIONS Most seasonal allergic rhinitis patients show physiological levels of FeNO prior to the pollen seasons and a marked increase in this parameter, probably proportional to pollination intensity, is observed within the seasons.

This happened despite SCD patients having often been heavy utilizers of the ED and hospital for their iconic vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). Though ambulatory SCD clinics quick converted largely to telehealth in order to comply with stay-at-home orders designed to suppress person-to-person transmission, some SCD patients appeared to avoid care, delay care, or refuse doctors' invitations for care. Presumably patients did so out of COVID fears, but this has not been confirmed in the literature. Further, whether these patients had COVID symptoms but stayed at home has not been studied. As part of quality improvement (QI) to conduct COVID surveillance in an adult sickle cell program, we sought to explain and predict SCD health care utilization patterns we were observing, as well as to determine urgent physical and mental health needs of patients who appeared to be avoiding care. Methods Fifteen staff in the Adult Sickle Cell Medical Home at Virginia Commonwealth University, a large urban academic medical center, conducted a telephone survey (wellness checkwas used when we talked to patients) of all known adults with SCD over 19 days in 2020. A staff member confirmed the patient had SCD, asked permission to proceed, then asked about symptoms consistent with COVID-19. At the end of the telephone survey, respondents wer invited to complete an email survey of sickle cell and COVID-19 utilization attitudes (19-33 items, depending on the response pattern, either drawn from the National Health Interview Survey, from the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement quality of care survey, or drafted by the authors), the Sickle Cell Stress Survey-Adult (SCSS-A, a 10-item previously validated survey), and anxiety and depression (PHQ9 of the PRIME-MD). Results Of 622 adults approached by phone call, 353 responded to the following yes/no screening questions regarding the prior 14 days: fever over 100 F 0/353 (0.00%); cough 3/353(0.01%); difficulty breathing 0/353(0.00%); unexplained shortness of breath 2/353(0.01%); sore throat 2/353 (0.01%); unexplained muscle soreness 2/353(0.01%);contact with anyone who tested positive for COVID-19 2/353(0.01%); testing for COVID 19 6/353(0.02%). For QI purposes, we set a threshold of three or more COVID-associated symptoms or the presence of fever as criteria requiring intense telephone or in-person staff monitoring for the following week. Only three patients met criteria. A total of 219/353 had email surveys sent. Of 63 patients (28.8%) who returned email surveys by June 10, 2020, 35.9% had already managed a pain attack at home 4 or more times in the prior 12 months, and 45.5% of these said their bad ER experiences were very or somewhat important in that decision. In the prior 14 days, although 30/64 reported a crisis for at least one day, only 4/64 had visited the Emergency Department for pain. On a 0-10 scale, 21/61 patients endorsed 0 for worry that they would be COVID-infected by going for medical care (weighted mean 3.9), but 18/59 endorsed 10 for worry they were more at risk of COVID because of SCD (weighted mean 6.31), and 22/60 endorsed 10 for worry they would fare worse than others if COVID infected (weighted mean 6.97). Many patients forwent needed care (16/62) or delayed needed care by at least a day (36/61). Eleven patients met criteria for moderately severe to severe depression on the PHQ-9, and 28/63 somewhat or strongly agreed with the statement death is always on the back of my mind on the SCSS-A. Conclusions In adolescents and adults with SCD, many were already reticent to come to the ED for pain, but a significant portion reported delays or avoidance of needed care during the early stages of the US COVID pandemic, and few reported using the ED despite over half reporting at least one crisis day in 14. Patients nonetheless reported very few COVID-associated symptoms. Fears of COVID infection/susceptibility may limit visits for needed sickle cell care among adults.

Rhinovirus (RV), the common cold virus, is clearly the most prevalent pathogen constantly circulating in the community. This virus also stands out from other viral factors due to its large diversity (about 170 genotypes), very effective replication, a tendency to create Th2-biased inflammatory environment and association with specific risk genes in people predisposed to asthma development (CDHR3). Decreased interferon responses, disrupted airway epithelial barrier, environmental exposures (including biased airway microbiome), and nutritional deficiencies (low in vitamin D and fish oil) increase risk to RV and other virus infections. It is intensively debated whether viral illnesses actually cause asthma. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading causative agent of bronchiolitis, whereas RV starts to dominate after 1 year of age. Breathing difficulty induced by either of these viruses is associated with later asthma, but the risk is higher for those who suffer from severe RV-induced wheezing. The asthma development associated with these viruses has unique mechanisms, but in general, RV is a risk factor for later atopic asthma, whereas RSV is more likely associated with later non-atopic asthma. Treatments that inhibit inflammation (corticosteroids, omalizumab) effectively decrease RV-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations. The anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, decreases the risk of severe RSV illness and subsequent recurrent wheeze. A better understanding of personal and environmental risk factors and inflammatory mechanisms leading to asthma is crucial in developing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of asthma.","output":"Role of viruses in asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability.

That led to an increased clothing insulation which is negatively affecting the perceived healthcare workers' thermal sensation. OBJECTIVES: While demonstrating through software simulations the potential level of thermal discomfort healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 emergency can be subjected to, this work aims at identifying measures to improve thermal sensation perception and acceptable thermal conditions for medical personnel. METHODS: After having obtained the insulation values of individual clothing used by staff during COVID-19 emergency through the use of a thermal well-being evaluation software, the Fanger indexes (PMV - Predicted Mean Vote and PPD - Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) were calculated in order to estimate staff satisfaction to microclimatic conditions. RESULTS: The use of COVID-19 additional PPEs with an air temperature equal to 22 C (normally considered optimal) brings the PMV index equal to 0.6, which corresponds to 11.8 % being unsatisfied (PPD) due to perceived heat. DISCUSSION: The use of additional protective devices significantly increases the clothing insulation level, facilitating the onset of conditions of thermal discomfort in the health workers. Workers engaged in the execution of nasopharyngeal swabs were most affected by the summer weather conditions and certainly represent the most critical category, for which it would be recommended to implement a higher turnover of service to reduce individual exposure time and consequent discomfort.","output":"Thermal discomfort in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is to analyse the impact of physical education based on the adventure education programme on the social competences of adolescent boys.

The policy has been commended but it had a devastating effect on the food economy of the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria. The study argues that the pandemic actually entrenched and deepened food scarcities in the region. This food deficit in the region was only possible because, among the several Nigerian ethnic nationalities, the Igbo owe much of their food supplies from outside. The Coronavirus pandemic total lockdown introduced by the federal government of Nigeria between the months of March to May 2020 amplified the food supply challenge. So while the crisis of food deficiency had the effect of traumatizing the people between 1967 and 1970 on account of the federal government food blockade leading to the brutal defeat of secessionist Biafra, the pandemic completely shut down the region with high prices of food across the length and breadth of the region.

The aim was to identify the key characteristics of a model that would encourage interest and commitment to partnerships from both parents and practitioners. The idea of such partnerships has a solid theoretical background and is supported both rhetorically and by legislation by the Department of Education. However, research has shown that practice often falls short of the ideal, due to reasons such as the managerial discourse that constructs parents as potential consumers and the challenges faced when performance is prioritised over creativity. As part of the study, we employed a mixed methods approach and encouraged parents and practitioners to work together by participating at two sessions with families and children. The sessions provided parents and practitioners with space and time to explore the issue of working in partnership. After careful consideration of ethical issues, data were collected using pre and post-session questionnaires with all participants, as well as face to face interviews with some of them. Findings indicate that both parties need to invest time and recognise that effective partnership is a two way process which requires engagement and dialogue to be able to develop meaningful relationships of trust. The findings were used to develop the CAFE' partnership model which incorporates those elements considered important to facilitate the development of partnerships between practitioners and parents. The CAFE model addresses the gap in the literature in terms of unpicking the key features of a partnership approach, as captured through the lived experience of both parents and practitioners. It also contributes to deepening the understanding of the applications of Froebelian principles in contemporary contexts and the ways in which they can encourage high quality early childhood development and education. Future research should explore how this model could be used to evaluate existing practice and guide the development of current partnership policies and approaches.","output":"Making Partnerships Work: Proposing a Model to Support Parent-Practitioner Partnerships in the Early Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unique ornamental features and extreme sexual traits of Peacock have always intrigued scientists and naturalists for centuries.

Genes involved in early developmental pathways including TGF-, BMP, and Wnt signaling, which have been shown to be involved in feather patterning, bone morphogenesis, and skeletal muscle development, revealed signs of adaptive evolution and provided useful clues on the phenotypes of peacock. Innate and adaptive immune genes involved in complement system and T-cell response also showed signs of adaptive evolution in peacock suggesting their possible role in building a robust immune system which is consistent with the predictions of the HamiltonCZuk hypothesis.

Despite the low pH of the gizzard, the duck influenza viruses reach the intestines via the digestive tract and are found in high concentration in the feces. The viruses retain infectivity in fecal material for at least 30 days at 4 and for 7 days at 20. The morphology of one strain of intestinal duck influenza virus (Hav7 Neg2) that had never been passed in embryonated eggs and was isolated from the feces was roughly spherical and fairly uniform in size and shape. However, another strain of duck influenza virus studied (Hav3 Nav6) was predominantly filamentous, suggesting that the morphology of influenza viruses in their natural hosts varies from strain to strain. After passage in the chick embryo each strain retained the morphological characteristics found in the feces. In contrast to duck influenza viruses, representative human influenza viruses of the HON1, H3N2, and Hswl Nl subtypes replicate only in the upper respiratory tract of ducks. The duck influenza viruses are more stable to low pH than human strains and retain infectivity for over 30 days in nonchlorinated river water at 0 and for 4 days at 22. The susceptibility of ducks to infection with human and avian strains of influenza virus and the possibility of transmission to animal species through the water supply suggests that ducks may be important in the ecology of influenza viruses.

The marine milieu has thousands of biological species that are a valuable source of novel functional proteins and peptides, which have been used in the treatment of many diseases, including cancer. In contrast with proteins and polypeptides, small peptides (with a molecular weight of less than 1000 Da) have overwhelming advantages, such as preferential and fast absorption, which can decrease the burden on human gastrointestinal function. Besides, these peptides are only connected by a few peptide bonds, and their small molecular weight makes it easy to modify and synthesize them. Specifically, small peptides can deliver nutrients and drugs to cells and tissues in the body. These characteristics make them stand out in relation to targeted drug therapy. Nowadays, the anticancer mechanisms of the small marine peptides are still largely not well understood; however, several marine peptides have been applied in preclinical treatment.

BACKGROUND Selection of primary retrograde approach (PRA) and the optimal timing to switch from antegrade to retrograde approach for coronary CTO-PCI is still debatable. METHODS Using the Japanese CTO-PCI expert registry data, we selected and analyzed 4461 patients who underwent CTO-PCI via PAA alone. The considerable lesion/anatomical factors for GWMT 20 and 30 min were analyzed. The risks of prolonged GWMT 20 and 30 min were stratified as easy, intermediate, difficult, and very difficult according to the multivariate analysis. RESULTS Nine lesion/anatomical characteristics (blunt stump, side branch at proximal cap, bifurcation at the exit point, calcification, tortuosity, occlusion length  20 mm, reattempt, nonleft anterior descending artery (nonleft anterior descending artery [LAD]), and tandem CTO) were independent predictors of GWMT 20 min (all p < 0.05). Excluding the nonLAD and tandem CTO, the same factors of GWMT 20 min correlated with GWMT 30 min (all p < 0.05). The distributions were increased in easy, intermediate, difficult, and very difficult subsets of GWMT 20 min (58.3%, 77.2%, 89.1%, and 100%) and GWMT 30 min (47.5%, 69.2%, 83.9%, and 100%).

METHODS: From March 1 to 31, 2020, 916 caregivers of older adults participated in an online cross-sectional survey on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. The seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was administered to measure anxiety symptoms, the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to assess depressive symptoms, and a self-developed questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality and duration. Six questions about COVID-19-related experiences were used to assess community-level infection contact and the level of exposure to media information. The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression and sleep problems were computed. The Wald &#967;2 were applied to compare the differences between subgroups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and multimorbidity. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were 46.8%, 29.8%, and 10.8%, respectively. Approximately 263 participants (28.7%) presented with two or more mental health problems. Being female (OR, 2.254; 95% CI, 1.510-3.363), having community-level COVID-19 contact (OR, 1.856; 95% CI, 1.189-2.898), and having a mental disorder (OR, 3.610; 95% CI, 1.644-7.930) were associated with increased risk of multimorbidity among caregivers. Caregivers who preferred positive information (OR, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.472-0.899) had reduced risk of multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression were common among caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic. Being female and having community-level COVID-19 contact were independent risk factors for experiencing multiple mental health problems. Preexisting mental disorders increased the risk of multimorbidity among caregivers, while enhanced access to positive media information decreased the risk of multimorbidity.","output":"Mental Health Multimorbidity among Caregivers of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical inactivity is a global pandemic.

Thrombolytic drugs activate plasminogen to its cleaved form plasmin, a proteolytic enzyme that breaks the crosslinks between fibrin molecules. The FDA-approved human tissue plasminogen activator Reteplase (rPA) is a non-glycosylated protein produced in E. coli. rPA is a deletion mutant of the wild-type Alteplase that benefits from an extended plasma half-life, reduced fibrin specificity and the ability to better penetrate into blood clots. Different methods have been proposed to improve the production of rPA. Here we show for the first time the transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana of rPA fused to the immunoglobulin fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on an IgG1, a strategy commonly used to improve the stability of therapeutic proteins. Despite our success on the expression and purification of dimeric rPA-Fc fusions, protein instability results in high amounts of Fc-derived degradation products. We hypothesize that the Y- shape of dimeric Fc fusions cause steric hindrance between protein domains and leads to physical instability. Indeed, mutations of critical residues in the Fc dimerization interface allowed the expression of fully stable rPA monomeric Fc-fusions. The ability of rPA-Fc to convert plasminogen into plasmin was demonstrated by plasminogen zymography and clot lysis assay shows that rPA-Fc is able to dissolve blood clots ex vivo. Finally, we addressed concerns with the plant-specific glycosylation by modulating rPA-Fc glycosylation towards serum-like structures including 2,6-sialylated and 1,6-core fucosylated N-glycans completely devoid of plant core fucose and xylose residues.","output":"Reteplase Fc-fusions produced in N. benthamiana are able to dissolve blood clots ex vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medicine has evolved into a high level of specialization using the very detailed imaging of organs [...].","output":"Systems Radiology and Personalized Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sharply in focus in the United States right now is the disproportionate COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates of Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and Pacific Islanders living in the United States in contrast to White people.

A factor that can potentially influence these reviews is the gender of the physician, because the physician's gender has been found to influence patient-physician communication. Our study is among the first to conduct a rigorous longitudinal analysis to study the effects of the gender of physicians on their reviews, after accounting for several important clinical factors, including patient risk, physician specialty, and temporal factors, using time fixed effects. In addition, this study is among the first to study the possible gender bias in web-based reviews using statewide data from Alabama, a predominantly rural state with high Medicaid and Medicare use. OBJECTIVE: This study conducts a longitudinal empirical investigation of the relationship between physician gender and their web-based reviews using data across the state of Alabama, after accounting for patient risk and temporal effects. METHODS: We created a unique data set by combining data from web-based physician reviews from the popular physician review website, RateMDs, and clinical data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the state of Alabama. We used longitudinal econometric specifications to conduct an econometric analysis, while controlling for several important clinical and review characteristics across four rating dimensions (helpfulness, knowledge, staff, and punctuality). The overall rating and these four rating dimensions from RateMDs were used as the dependent variables, and physician gender was the key explanatory variable in our panel regression models. RESULTS: The panel used to conduct the main econometric analysis included 1093 physicians. After controlling for several clinical and review factors, the physician random effects specifications showed that male physicians receive better web-based ratings than female physicians. Coefficients and corresponding SEs and P values of the binary variable GenderFemale (1 for female physicians and 0 otherwise) with different rating variables as outcomes were as follows: OverallRating (coefficient -0.194, SE 0.060; P=.001), HelpfulnessRating (coefficient -0.221, SE 0.069; P=.001), KnowledgeRating (coefficient -0.230, SE 0.065; P<.001), StaffRating (coefficient -0.123, SE 0.062; P=.049), and PunctualityRating (coefficient -0.200, SE 0.067; P=.003). The negative coefficients indicate a bias toward male physicians versus female physicians for aforementioned rating variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that female physicians receive lower web-based ratings than male physicians even after accounting for several clinical characteristics associated with the physicians and temporal effects. Although the magnitude of the coefficients of GenderFemale was relatively small, they were statistically significant. This study provides support to the findings on gender bias in the existing health care literature. We contribute to the existing literature by conducting a study using data across the state of Alabama and using a longitudinal econometric analysis, along with incorporating important clinical and review controls associated with the physicians.","output":"Physician Gender, Patient Risk, and Web-Based Reviews: Longitudinal Study of the Relationship Between Physicians' Gender and Their Web-Based Reviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes our submission on the COVID-19 literature annotation task at Biocreative VII.

Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

METHODS: A telemedicine workflow was implemented as a quality improvement study using the Plan-Do-Study-Act method. All patients presenting with ureteric colic without high-risk features of fever, severe pain, and hydronephrosis, were recruited, and face-to-face appointments to review scan results were replaced with phone consultations. Data were prospectively collected over 3 years (January 2017 to December 2019). Patient outcomes including the reduction in face-to-face review visits, time to review, reattendance and intervention rates, were tracked in an interrupted time-series analysis, and qualitative feedback was obtained from patients and clinicians. RESULTS: Around 53.2% of patients presenting with ureteric colic were recruited into the telemedicine workflow. A total of 465 patients (46.2%) had normal scan results and 250 patients (24.9%) did not attend their scan appointments, hence reducing the number of face-to-face consultations by 71.1%. A total of 230 patients (22.9%) required subsequent follow-up with urology, while 61 patients (6.1%) were referred to other specialties. Mean (SD) time to review was 30.0 (6.2) days, 6-month intervention rate was 3.4% (n = 34) and unplanned reattendance rate was 3.2% (n = 32). Around 93.1% of patients reported satisfaction with the service. CONCLUSION: The ureteric colic telemedicine service successfully and sustainably reduced the number of face-to-face consultations and time to review without compromising on patient safety.

These include turnover of cellular organelles and extracellular constituents; amino acid and glucose homeostasis; processing of proteins; lipid metabolism; cell growth, differentiation, and involution; host defenses against microorganisms and other pathogens; and removal of necrotic and foreign material from the circulation and from tissues. Lysosomal degradation also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic cell injury, inflammation and repair, and tumor growth and metastasis. The participation of the lysosomes in the specific types of cell injury we have discussed is due to altered regulation of one or more of the following processes: turnover of cellular organelles by autophagic degradation; levels and activities of lysosomal hydrolases; levels of intracellular and extracellular lysosomal hydrolase inhibitors; transport of degradation products from the lysosomal matrix to the cytosol; permeability of the lysosomal membrane to hydrolases; lysosomal vacuolar acidification; transport of degradable substrates and of pathogens to the lysosomes; transport and processing of secretory proteins and lysosomal hydrolases during biogenesis; traffic and fusion of lysosomal vacuoles and vesicles; secretion of lysosomal hydrolases; and accumulation of metals, particularly iron, acidotropic agents, and undegraded and/or undegradable materials in lysosomes.","output":"Chapter 5 Role of lysosomes in cell injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newborn coronaivus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the foremost concern of health system worldwide.

We estimated the risk of hospitalisation and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for infections with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in Norway, compared to infections with non-VOC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using linked individual-level data from national registries, we conducted a cohort study on laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway diagnosed between 28 December 2020 and 2 May 2021. Variants were identified based on whole genome sequencing, partial sequencing by Sanger sequencing or PCR screening for selected targets. The outcome was hospitalisation or ICU admission. We calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable binomial regression to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 with i) hospital admission and ii) ICU admission compared to non-VOC. RESULTS: We included 23,169 cases of B.1.1.7, 548 B.1.351 and 4,584 non-VOC. Overall, 1,017 cases were hospitalised (3.6%) and 206 admitted to ICU (0.7%). B.1.1.7 was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of hospitalisation (aRR 95%CI 1.6C2.3) and a 1.8-fold increased risk of ICU admission (aRR 95%CI 1.2C2.8) compared to non-VOC. Among hospitalised cases, no difference was found in the risk of ICU admission between B.1.1.7 and non-VOC. B.1.351 was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of hospitalisation (aRR 95%CI 1.7C3.3) and a 2.7-fold increased risk of ICU admission (aRR 95%CI 1.2C6.5) compared to non-VOC. DISCUSSION: Our findings add to the growing evidence of a higher risk of severe disease among persons infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351. This highlights the importance of prevention and control measures to reduce transmission of these VOC in society, particularly ongoing vaccination programmes, and preparedness plans for hospital surge capacity.","output":"Increased risk of hospitalisation and intensive care admission associated with reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in Norway, December 2020 CMay 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acral inflammatory lesions that have some resemblance to idiopathic or autoimmune-associated perniosis (chilblains) have been described in multiple countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We examined histopathologic findings in six consecutive such cases from five patients received in mid-May to mid-June of 2020, evaluating immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. We compared these six cases to eight cases diagnosed as perniosis between January and June of 2019. RESULTS: Five of six lesions with perniosis-like histopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic had distinctive tight cuffing of lymphocytes; intravascular material was present in one case. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemical staining using an antibody directed at the nucleocapsid protein was negative in all six cases. Only one of eight specimens with microscopic findings of perniosis received prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had tightly cuffed perivascular lymphocytes, and none had obvious intravascular occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: A tightly cuffed pattern of perivascular lymphocytes is a feature of perniosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. The absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in these cases suggests against the virus being directly present in these lesions.","output":"Perniosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: Negative anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry in six patients and comparison to perniosis before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Individuals with diabetes have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on the impact of COVID-19 on youth with T1D is scarce. We sought to determine the impact on youth with T1D and their families including the extent to which they experienced COVID-related disruptions and distress. Methods: The COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS) was administered to caregivers of youth with T1D at two comprehensive diabetes clinics in the northeast and southern U.S. Items were scored and analyzed using SPSS. Themes were coded for open-ended questions. Health data were extracted from EMR. Results: Mothers (85%) of 47 youth (72%NHW, 24%NHB, 4%H) with T1D (HbA1c M=8.3%) ranging from 6 to 17 years participated. Insulin pumps were used by 66% and CGMs by 17%. The most frequent COVID-related challenges endorsed were school/childcare closure (95.1%), education disruption (87.2%) and inability to visit/care for family (74.5%). Fewer caregivers reported difficulty accessing food (11.3%), necessary health care (9.4%), or medicine (5.7%). Areas of negative impact included child's access to medical supplies (2.6), physical activity level and diet (M=2.7), as well as caregiver anxiety (M =3.2), mood (M =2.8), sleeping, eating, and exercise (M=2.7).

The objective of this research was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and behaviour of three DOTA based bisphosphonate functionalised ligands (BPAMD, BPAPD and BPPED), using both (68)Ga -PET in vivo imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in healthy Wistar rats. The compounds were labelled with (68)Ga in high yields using an ammonium acetate buffer, and subsequently purified using a cation exchange resin. High bone uptake values were observed for all (68)Ga-labelled bisphosphonates at 60 minutes p.i.

As part of the innate immune response, these enzymes are activated by viral double stranded RNA or mRNAs with significant double stranded structure. The 2-5As in turn activate RNaseL that degrade single stranded RNAs. Three distinct forms of OAS exist in human cells (OAS1, 2 and 3) with each form having multiple spliced variants. The OAS enzymes and their spliced variants have different enzyme activities. OAS enzymes also play a significant role in regulating multiple cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter OAS activity are also associated with viral infection, diabetes and cancer. Thus detection of OAS enzyme activity with a simple spectrophotometric method in cells will be important in clinical research. RESULTS: Here we propose a modified coupled spectrophotometric assay to detect 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzyme activity in prostate cell lines as a model system. The OAS enzyme from prostate cancer cell lysates was purified using Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) bound activated sepharose beads. The activated OAS enzyme eluted from Sepharose beads showed expression of p46 isoform of OAS1, generally considered the most abundant OAS isoform in elutes from DU14 cell line but not in other prostate cell line. In this assay the phosphates generated by the OAS enzymatic reaction is coupled with conversion of the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (methylthioguanosine, a guanosine analogue; MESG) to a purine base product, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose1-phosphate via a catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase (phosphorylase) using a commercially available pyrophosphate kit. The absorbance of the purine base product is measured at 360 nm. The higher levels of phosphates detected in DU145 cell line indicates more activity of OAS in this prostate cancer cell line. CONCLUSION: The modified simple method detected OAS enzyme activity with sensitivity and specificity, which could help in detection of OAS enzymes avoiding the laborious and radioactive methods.","output":"A Modified Coupled Spectrophotometric Method to Detect 2-5 Oligoadenylate Synthetase Activity in Prostate Cell Lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia is generally used to describe the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of physical frailty and functional impairment that may occur with old age. The knowledge surrounding the prevalence and determinants of sarcopenia in older medical patients is scarce, and it is unknown whether specific biomarkers can predict physical deconditioning during hospitalisation. We hypothesise that a combination of clinical, functional and circulating biomarkers can serve as a risk stratification tool and can (i) identify older acutely ill medical patients at risk of prolonged hospital stays and (ii) predict changes in muscle mass, muscle strength and function during hospitalisation. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: The Copenhagen PROTECT study is a prospective cohort study consisting of acutely ill older medical patients admitted to the acute medical ward at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. Assessments are performed within 24 hours of admission and include blood samples, body composition, muscle strength, physical function and questionnaires. A subgroup of patients transferred to the Geriatric Department are included in a smaller geriatric cohort and have additional assessments at discharge to evaluate the relative change in circulating biomarker concentrations, body composition, muscle strength and physical function during hospitalisation.

For providers of aesthetic surgery procedures or minimal invasive cosmetic treatments, this led to a huge socio-economic impact worldwide. In order to evaluate valid clinical management strategies for future pandemic events and to overcome the challenges imposed by the current pandemic, it is paramount to analyse the socio-economic effects caused by the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: An online survey comprising 18 questions was sent out five times by e-mail to all members of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) between June and August 2020. The data set was statistically analyzed and grouped into an overall group and into subgroups of countries with high (n = 251) vs. low (n = 440) gross domestic product per capita (GDP p.c.) and five defined world regions (Europe (n = 214); North America (NA; n = 97); South America (SA; n = 206); Asia and Oceania (Asia + OC; n = 99); Africa and Middle East (Africa + ME; n = 75)). RESULTS: A total of 691 recipients completed the survey. The majority of the participants experienced severe operating restrictions resulting in a major drop of income from surgical patients. Low GDP p.c. countries experienced a bigger negative economic impact with less aesthetic (non-) surgical procedures, whereas the high GDP p.c. subgroup was less affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Most of the survey participants had already adopted the ISAPS guidelines for patient (pre-) appointment screening and clinical/patient-flow management. For surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures, in the high GDP p.c. subgroup more basic-level PPE (surgical mask) was used, whereas the low GDP p.c. subgroup relied more on advanced-level PPE (N-95 respirator mask or higher). Comparing the different world regions, Europe and Africa used more basic-level PPE. CONCLUSIONS: Measurable differences in the socio-economic impact and in the adaptation of safety protocols between high and low GDP p.c. subgroups and between different world regions were present.

Post-course reflective essays suggest that various student needs were met, indicating that the setup supports flexible learning outcomes. Authentic learning outcomes like knowledge transfer, reflection, challenge, and realism were also experienced. Further, although statistically insignificant due to lack of observations, a regression analysis shows that experiencing and overcoming challenges ( = 3.996, p = .082) provides the biggest learning outcome (R2 = 0.325). A focus group with other simulation practitioners suggests the benefits of this method could extend to them.

The performance, counts of predominant microorganisms, and bioaerosol emissions of a full-scale TSIBF system were studied. High and stable removal efficiencies of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and VOCs could be achieved with the TSIBF system, and the emissions of culturable heterotrophic bacteria, fungi and acidophilic sulfur bacteria were relatively low. The removal efficiencies of different odors and VOCs, emissions of culturable microorganisms, and types of predominant microorganisms were different in the ABRS, FRS and HBRS due to the differences in reaction conditions and mass transfer in each segment. The emissions of bioaerosols from the TSIBF depended on the capture of microorganisms and their volatilization from the packing. The rational segmentation, filling of high-density packings and the accumulation of the predominant functional microorganisms in each segment enhanced the capture effect of the bioaerosols, thus reducing the emissions of microorganisms from the bioreactor.

RECENT FINDINGS Fourteen heterogeneous studies met inclusion criteria. Three provided lifetime prevalence estimates among particular subgroups (from 0.5 to 8%), whereas one longitudinal study found adverse childhood experiences predicted later nonprescribed androgen use. Mental health and substance problems appear to correlate with severity of use, but evidence is mixed as to whether female users had lower or equal mental health burdens compared to male users. Studies that discuss motivation highlighted the dynamic risk management that underlies decisions to continue use; benefits have to outweigh undesired effects, whereas some sexual side effects are re-framed to be positive. Finally, a theme among qualitative studies is the gendered experiences of nonprescribed androgen use, and the search for knowledge and communities created by women. SUMMARY Prevalence, side effects, and trajectories of use appear to be different for women than men. Women users need gender-specific information, although some are able to navigate male-dominated knowledge sources and are creating a female ethnopharmacology that privileges women's experiences. Health research, including epidemiology, gravely needs a gender perspective when examining nonprescribed androgen use, and one that is inclusive of transgender people.","output":"Nonprescribed androgen use among women and trans men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has hit the European region disproportionately. Many HIV clinics share staff and logistics with infectious disease facilities, which are now on the frontline in tackling COVID-19. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the current pandemic situation on HIV care and continuity of antiretroviral treatment (ART) supplies in CEE countries. METHODS: The Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group was established in February 2016 to review standards of care for HIV in the region. The group consists of professionals actively involved in HIV care. On March 19, 2020 we decided to review the status of HIV care sustainability in the face of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. For this purpose, we constructed an online survey consisting of 23 questions. Respondents were recruited from ECEE members in 22 countries, based on their involvement in HIV care, and contacted via email. RESULTS: In total, 19 countries responded: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Most of the respondents were infectious disease physicians directly involved in HIV care (17/19). No country reported HIV clinic closures. HIV clinics were operating normally in only six countries (31.6%). In 11 countries (57.9%) physicians were sharing HIV and COVID-19 care duties. None of the countries expected shortage of ART in the following 2 weeks; however, five physicians expressed uncertainty about the following 2 months. At the time of providing responses, ten countries (52.6%) had HIV-positive persons under quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: A shortage of resources is evident, with an impact on HIV care inevitable. We need to prepare to operate with minimal medical resources, with the aim of securing constant supplies of ART. Non-governmental organizations should re-evaluate their earlier objectives and support efforts to ensure continuity of ART delivery.","output":"HIV care in times of the COVID-19 crisis - Where are we now in Central and Eastern Europe?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Delivering high quality teaching during an international pandemic is challenging but becomes increasingly important when trainees are taking on new roles and responsibilities. Instead of ceasing our simulation programme, we adapted it to comply with local infection control guidelines. We devised in-situ high-fidelity ward round simulations for all levels of trainee, from newly qualified doctors to senior registrars. METHOD: The ward round consisted of three simulated patients with a range of conditions appropriate for the level of trainee, role-played by faculty members. The simulations were offered to all Foundation Year Doctors, Junior Middle Grade Doctors and Surgical Speciality Trainees with all participants wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) according to COVID-19 infection control policy. RESULTS: A total of 81 trainees took part in the simulations. Almost all reported it as very useful and that it improved confidence in progressing to the next stage of their career. Trainees also found it enjoyable and that personalised feedback allowed them to identify areas for development. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that ward round simulations can be run safely and effectively despite current COVID-19 restrictions. Even senior trainees found that a ward round simulation was useful and were keen to see it become a regular part of deanery teaching.","output":"548 The New Normal?

However, this literature has not considered the role that the countries stock of human capital can have in the successful use of ICT for learning. In this paper, we test empirically the existence of complementarities between human capital and technology adoption for learning. We carry out an empirical analysis with PISA data from a large-scale sample of 363,412 students enrolled in 13,215 schools in 48 countries. We estimate a hierarchical linear model (HLM) of three levels: students, schools, and countries. Our results strongly support the evidence of a positive externality of the stock of human capital on ICT use for learning. When we consider the moderator-effect of the stock of human capital, we find that the negative outcome of ICT use on students outcomes in mathematics, reading and science turns positive (greater and more positive the higher the stocks of human capital are). The greater the stock of human capital an economy has, the more benefits it can get from investments in ICT for learning.","output":"ICT Use and Successful Learning: The Role of the Stock of Human Capital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As global vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 proceed, there is emerging interest in the longevity of immune protection, especially with regard to increasingly infectious virus variants. Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 are promising correlates of protective immunity and have been successfully used for prevention and therapy. To assess neutralizing capacity, we developed a bead-based multiplex ACE2 RBD competition assay as a large scalable, time-, cost-, and material-saving alternative to infectious live-virus neutralization tests. By mimicking the interaction between ACE2 and RBD, this assay detects the presence of Nabs against SARS-CoV2 in serum. Using this multiplex approach allows the simultaneous analysis of Nabs against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants of interest in a single well. Following validation, we analyzed 325 serum samples from 186 COVID-19 patients of varying severity. Neutralization capacity was reduced for all variants examined compared to wild-type, especially for those displaying the E484K mutation. The neutralizing immune response itself, while highly individualistic, positively correlates with IgG levels. Neutralization capacity also correlated with disease severity up to WHO grade 7, after which it reduced.","output":"Reduced serum neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 variants in a multiplex ACE2 RBD competition assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Throughout history, the world has witnessed natural disasters affecting businesses and societies with varying degrees of disruption. COVID-19 (henceforth C19) constituted a significant system shock and a stark reminder of the fragility and sensitive nature of supply chains. The pandemic has exerted considerable societal and economic pressure and has had an adverse impact on food supply chains in particular. Many food processing operations were forced to alter activities or close temporarily due to outbreaks. Societal lockdowns, travel restrictions, business closures and quarantine have led to structural changes in the productivity of economies and impacted the mental health and financial wellbeing of citizens. Methods: We present a critical review of the literature to explore the impact of C19 on the food supply chain. We collected data from journal articles retrieved from a leading scientific database (i.e., Scopus), books, chapters, conference proceedings, reports, and a variety of Internet websites. For the literature search, we used the following words;\\"COVID-19\\" and \\"food\\". Results and conclusions: The findings of the review suggest that the C19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for food supply chains. We reveal that C19 has raised food insecurity and food safety concerns, increased supply chain and logistics costs and radically changed consumer behavior. On the positive side, the pandemic has improved awareness of food waste and the importance of self-grown foods. We generated nine research propositions to foster future academic research. Our study also highlighted the need to advance this literature and calls for increased attention from the supply chain management and logistics community to further analyse and quantify the impact of C19 on the food chain.Alternate abstract: Streszczenie: Wst?p: W uj?ciu historycznym, ?wiat ju? nieraz do?wiadcza? naturalnych katastrof, ktre mia?y wp?yw w r?nym nasileniu na biznes oraz spo?eczestwo.

We applied quasi-Poisson regression models to the daily number of emergency transportations due to heat illness from 2008 to 2020 from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, to estimate the expected weekly number of emergency transportations from heat illness, with adjustment for their long-term trend and the weather conditions, including temperatures. We found that, at the national level, the number of heat illness emergency transports did not significantly increase or decrease from the annual trend in 2020. By prefecture, on the other hand, there were some prefectures in which the number of heat illness emergency transports was less than the average year, and most of them were in the week of August 10-16. By age group, the number of heat illness emergency transports in the 0-17 and 18-64 age groups was particularly low in some prefectures, and by severity, those in mild cases was particularly low. A caution is necessary that there is a possibility that a decrease in cases possibly associated with COVID-19 measures, such as, outdoor activity restrictions at schools/universities and cancellation of public events, may offset the possible increase in heat illness cases occurring elsewhere associated with wearing masks. Given that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is not expected yet, continuous and appropriate awareness-raising activities to prevent heat-related illness remain important.","output":"Trends in emergency transportation due to heat illness under the new normal lifestyle in the COVID-19 era, in Japan and 47 prefectures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The envelope glycoprotein, termed the spike protein, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is known to mediate viral entry. Similar to other class 1 viral fusion proteins, the heptad repeat regions of SARS-CoV spike are thought to undergo conformational changes from a prefusion form to a subsequent post-fusion form that enables fusion of the viral and host membranes. Recently, the structure of a post-fusion form of SARS-CoV spike, which consists of isolated domains of heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), has been determined by x-ray crystallography. To date there is no structural information for the prefusion conformations of SARS-CoV HR1 and HR2. In this work we present the NMR structure of the HR2 domain (residues 1141-1193) from SARS-CoV (termed S2-HR2) in the presence of the co-solvent trifluoroethanol. We find that in the absence of HR1, S2-HR2 forms a coiled coil symmetric trimer with a complex molecular mass of 18 kDa. The S2-HR2 structure, which is the first example of the prefusion form of coronavirus envelope, supports the current model of viral membrane fusion and gives insight into the design of structure-based antagonists of SARS.","output":"Solution Structure of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Heptad Repeat 2 Domain in the Prefusion State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WATERLIT Abstract: Africas health systems are strained by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Radical tumor resection including the involved dural attachment, underlying hyperostotic bone, and intracanalicular tumor in the optic canal offers the best chance of a Simpson Grade I resection to minimize recurrence. Decompression of the optic canal with removal of the intracanalicular tumor also improves visual outcome since this portion of the tumor is usually the cause of asymmetrical visual loss. The purely endoscopic endonasal extended transsphenoidal approach offers a direct midline trajectory and immediate access to tuberculum sellae meningiomas without brain retraction and manipulation of neurovascular structures. Although the endoscopic approach has been previously criticized for its inability to remove tumor within the optic canals, complete Simpson Grade I tumor removal including intracanalicular tumor, dural attachment, and involved hyperostotic bone can be achieved in properly selected patients. Excellent visualization of the suprasellar region and the inferomedial aspects of both optic canals allows for extracapsular, extraarachnoid dissection of the tumor from the critical structures using bimanual microsurgical dissection. In this report, the authors describe the operative nuances for removal of tuberculum sellae meningiomas with optic canal involvement using a purely endoscopic endonasal extended transsphenoidal (transplanum transtuberculum) approach.

The effect of facecovers on the gaze when looking at faces has not yet been assessed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate any potential differences in eye movement pattern in observers exposed to images showing a face without and with a facecover to identify if there is truly a change of gaze when identifying (masked) facial features. METHODS: The eye movement of 64 study participants (28 males and 36 females) with a mean [standard deviation] age of 31.84 [9.0] years was analyzed in this cross-sectional observational study. Eye movement analysis was conducted based on positional changes of eye features within an x- and y-coordinate system while two images (face without/with facecover) were displayed for 8 seconds. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that the sequence of focusing on facial regions was not altered when wearing a facecover and followed the sequence: perioral, nose, periorbital. Wearing a facecover significantly increased the time spent focusing on the periorbital region and also increased the number of repeated eye fixations during the 8-second visual stimulus presentation. No statistically significant differences were observed between male and female participants in their eye movement pattern across all investigated variables (Pa? >a? 0.433).

We tested the hypothesis that Argatroban is non-inferior to UFH regarding thrombosis and bleeding during vvECMO. METHODS: We conducted a propensity-score matched observational non-inferiority study of consecutive patients without heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia (HIT) on vvECMO, treated between January 2006 and March 2019 in the medical intensive care unit at the University Hospital Regensburg. Anticoagulation was realized with UFH until August 2017 and with Argatroban from September 2017 onwards. Target activated partial thromboplastin time was 50  5seconds in both groups. Primary composite endpoint was major thrombosis and/or major bleeding. Major bleeding was defined as a drop in hemoglobin of  2 g/dl/day or in transfusion of  2 packed red cells/24 h, or retroperitoneal, cerebral, or pulmonary bleeding. Major thrombosis was defined as obstruction of > 50% of the vessel lumen diameter by means of duplex sonography. We also assessed technical complications such as oxygenator defects or pump head thrombosis, the time-course of platelets, and the cost of anticoagulation (including HIT-testing). RESULTS: Out of 465 patients receiving UFH, 78 were matched to 39 patients receiving Argatroban. The primary endpoint occurred in 79% of patients in the Argatroban group and in 83% in the UFH group (non-inferiority for Argatroban, p = 0.026). The occurrence of technical complications was equally distributed (Argatroban 49% vs. UFH 42%, p = 0.511). The number of platelets was similar in both groups before ECMO therapy but lower in the UFH group after end of ECMO support (median [IQR]: 141 [104;198]/nl vs. 107 [54;171]/nl, p = 0.010). Anticoagulation costs per day of ECMO were higher in the Argatroban group (26 [13.8;53.0] vs. 0.9 [0.5;1.5], p < 0.001) but not after accounting for blood products and HIT-testing (63 [42;171) vs. 40 [17;158], p = 0.074). CONCLUSION: In patients without HIT on vvECMO, Argatroban was non-inferior to UFH regarding bleeding and thrombosis. The occurrence of technical complications was similarly distributed.

There are forecasts that there will be an exponential increase in the number of such deaths across the globe because of this deadly virus. To arrest the spread of the virus in this situation, the supply of medical materials including PPE and body bags (also known as human remains pouch or cadaver bag) should be designed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Conventional body bags have shortcomings, which need to be addressed by a refined redesigning and use of appropriate materials to adequately match the requirements in the current Covid-19 situation. Current designs of the body bags do not allow the family members sentiments towards the deceased and to cater to the desire of the family members to view the face of the deceased without exposing them to a strong possibility of infection from the cadaver. This is, therefore, a very traumatic experience to the family and in many cases, the cadaver is not handled with respect due to the unavailability of safe design body bags, which also exposes health workers to avoidable risk from the infections. Technopark@iitk has proposed an integrated 5-layer body bag to tackle this situation for Covid-19 deceased such that it is (1) leak-proof, (2) impermeable/water-proof, (3) strong enough for the purpose, (4) ergonomically designed, and (5) has provision to view the face of the dead body for family viewing before cremation/burial. This new design would keep the handling of the deceased body to a minimum during transportation from the hospital/site of death to a mortuary, and then to the home of the deceased/burial ground/crematorium, where it may be disposed-off along with the body in it, in a respectable manner, without putting people involved to the risk of infection.","output":"Conceptual Design of a Body Bag for Preventing Infections and Safe Disposal of Deceased from COVID-19 Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Surgery for low rectal cancer remains a challenge when a standard laparoscopic approach is used. Transanal endoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) has been shown to be feasible and to be associated with a low conversion rate. Combining the transanal and transabdominal single-port approaches (with an abdominal single port implanted in the future stoma and extraction site) could allow TME with minimal wound trauma, low morbidity, and faster recovery. The aim of the current study was to assess the short- and mid-term results of this technique. METHODS We conducted a prospective single-centre study of consecutive patients presenting with low rectal cancer requiring a conservative proctectomy with a manual coloanal anastomosis between January 2012 and April 2015. RESULTS During the study period, 41 patients were recruited. Conversion to open surgery was required in only one patient (2.4%). The median operating time was 358.5 min (range 300-600 min). Partial intersphincteric resection was necessary for 15 patients (36.6%). The specimens were mostly extracted via the abdominal access (n = 34) without wound complications. The mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 12.7 (range 6-24 lymph nodes). Specimens were graded as complete (n = 31) or nearly complete (n = 10) in all of the patients, and the circumferential resection margin positivity was 4.9%. Intraoperative morbidity rate was 4.9%, and the 30-day morbidity rate was 24.4% (n = 10). Sixty per cent (n = 6) of the patients with 30-day morbidity were Dindo I-II. At a median follow-up of 29 months, overall and disease-free survival rates were 97.5 and 80.5%, respectively. The stoma-free survival rate was 95.1%.

A cross-sectional questionnaire-based prospective survey was conducted between September 2019 and June 2020 on parents of children attending primary education in the city of Patras in Western Greece. Data on parental attitudes and beliefs about vaccinations were collected and analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with vaccine uptake. Out of 2154 distributed questionnaires, 1227 were completed and returned (response rate 56.9%). The main vaccine information source for Greek parents was their primary care pediatrician (90.8%). Doubts still exist amongst approximately one-third of them (33.5%) regarding a possible relationship between vaccines and autism. Of note, 44% of the study participants believe that unvaccinated children could attend school. 84.6% of the parents in our cohort admitted that they had fully vaccinated their children. In the multivariable analysis, marital status (p < .002) and Greek nationality (p < .001) were found to be the most significant determinants of vaccine uptake.

Thus, our objective is to contribute to establish means of infection control protecting HCWs in the frontline of the current pandemic. DESIGN: An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was detected and contained in a pediatric ICU (PICU). The first positive case was identified with a point-of-care diagnostic system on site. Real-time PCR-based testing systems from self-collected nasopharyngeal samples swabs were used to test for viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the follow-up.

The estimated incidence is 12.6 cases per one million second dose m-RNA vaccine delivery. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 17-years-old male was admitted at our department after 18 days COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine second dose delivery with persistent chest pain without respiratory symptoms and, ST-elevation and PR-depression in V3CV6 at the ECG on 3 August 2021. He had no history of heart disease. Physical examination didnt show anything relevant except for mildly tachycardic heart sounds. In addition blood test showed increase in C-reactive protein, cardiac troponin and N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. An echocardiography showed widespread hypokinesia with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and highly echogenic pericardium. During the first day cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed, which showed mild diffuse myocardial oedema on T2-weighted images and T2 mapping and two thin areas of delayed enhancement with non-ischaemic pattern in the lateral wall with involvement of the pericardial sheets confirming peri-myocarditis diagnosis. After 24 h, the ECG showed spread and deep T-waves with QTc prolongation. We performed multiple ECG during the days after to assess morphology changes and QTc. The patient has been asymptomatic for all the hospitalization and on day 7 was performed an echocardiography which describe a full recovery in terms of kinesia and left ventricular ejection fraction. He was discharged asymptomatic with better but still negative T-waves and QTc normalization. Two months after discharge CMR was repeated and showed normal left ventricular function without myocardial oedema and pericardial involvement, but with persistent the areas of delayed enhancement with non-ischaemic pattern in the lateral wall. CONCLUSIONS: In this case report we describe an uncommon COVID-19 m-RNA Vaccine side effect. The first issue is the timing of presentation. On 19 July 2021, AIFA stated that myocarditis is a very uncommon side effect and it usually presents within 14 days after 2nd dose delivery. Our patient was admitted at our department after that time period, probably because we reported the ending part of the myocarditis presented with symptoms of pericarditis; indeed we didnt report the cardiac troponin plateau but only the descending cardiac troponin wave and we attend a very quick recovery. The second issue in the unique ECG with a very quick evolution (Tako-Tsubo morphology like) which could be characteristic of this kind of Myocarditis. Third, the good progress of the inflammation and quick recovery. Surely is a serious side effect but its still less frequent and with better prognosis than COVID-19 Myocarditis. European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently stated authorized COVID-19 vaccines advantages are still above risks in all age groups beyond 12 y/o.

The pooling test may offer an economical and effective approach to increase virus testing capacity of medical laboratories without requiring more laboratory resources such as laboratory workers, testing reagents and equipment. In this study, the sample pools of 6 and 10 were detected by a real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting ORF1ab and N genes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Each pool consisted of 5 or 9 negative SARS-CoV-2 samples and 1 positive counterpart with varying viral loads. Two different strategies of sample pooling were investigated and the results were compared comprehensively. One approach was to pool viral transport medium (VTM) of the samples in the laboratory, and the other was to pool swab samples during collection process. For swab pooling strategy, qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, specific tests of ORF1ab and N genes, remained stable over the different pool sizes. Together, this study demonstrates that the swab pooling strategy may serve as an effective and economical approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations, especially in countries and regions where medical resources are limited during the pandemic and may thus be potential for clinical laboratory applications.

Education programs for health care professionals are often siloed, providing students with limited interprofessional education (IPE) opportunities to learn from, with, and about other professions. Podcasts offer a novel approach to facilitate IPE, allowing for asynchronous conversations with interprofessional colleagues. METHODS: We developed four podcasts with various health care professionals for 135 preclinical medical students preparing to transition into clinical rotations. The podcasts were coupled with an hour-long interactive session with the podcast interviewees conducted via videoconference. The curriculum explored the distinct education paths, roles, and responsibilities of various health care disciplines. Strategies for communicating effectively with and learning from interprofessional team members were emphasized. RESULTS: There were 197 unique downloads of the podcasts, and 95 students attended the interactive session. Most students reported that the podcasts and follow-up live session enhanced their learning (100% and 98% of students who completed the postcurriculum survey, respectively). Responses to the postcurriculum survey revealed students learned strategies for engaging in productive interprofessional conversations, the importance of leveraging the distinct roles and responsibilities of diverse health professionals, the value of learning from other health professionals, and the use of respectful language. DISCUSSION: This IPE curriculum built around podcasts enhances medical student learning and represents an innovative approach to improving access to IPE in a virtual learning environment.

As a counterpoint, the current study uses a mixed-methods coproduction approach to share psychosocial insights into the adoption of positive changes made during national lockdown in Scotland. This study examines the psychosocial patterning of positive behavior changes and the psychosocial processes by which positive change was realized and shared these insights with partner organizations. METHOD A sequential mixed-methods design included an online survey (N = 2,445) assessing positive changes in sleep and physical activity patterns and the role of sociodemographics, mood, social support, coping, and resilience using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Interviews were performed with a purposive diverse subsample of people self-reporting high levels of positive change (n = 48) and used thematic analysis. RESULTS The survey identified that positive behavior change was significantly patterned by age, gender, and vulnerability to COVID-19. Higher levels of positive reframing and active coping in relation to stress were associated with higher levels of positive behavior change. Higher symptoms of depression, planning, and self-distraction were associated with less positive behavior change.

During a pandemic, the initial cases may be difficult to recognize, but subsequent clinical diagnoses were relatively straightforward, given the high volume of cases and their typical clinical presentation. Swine influenza pneumonia presents as an influenza-like illness (ILI) with dry cough, fever >102F and myalgias. A variety of other viral pneumonias, eg, cytomegalovirus, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV 3), and adenovirus, as well as bacterial community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs) that may present with some of the clinical and laboratory features of H1N1 pneumonia. Most adults admitted to hospitals with ILIs during the pandemic had, in fact, definite or probable H1N1 pneumonia. The Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital developed a diagnostic weighted point score to identify probable H1N1 cases in hospitalized adults with rapid negative influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs). METHODS: We present a case of an elderly male who presented with an ILI and negative RIDTs during the H1N1 pandemic. He was admitted with a diagnosis of possible H1N1, and placed on influenza precautions and oseltamivir. Although the patient had features consistent with H1N1 pneumonia, Legionnaires' disease was included in the differential diagnosis because of his elevated serum ferritin levels. A Legionella urinary antigen test was positive for Legionella pneumophila (serogroups 01-06). RESULTS: The peak seasonal incidence of sporadic Legionnaires' disease occurs in the summer and fall. Even in the midst of a pandemic, clinicians should be on the alert for other infectious diseases that may mimic H1N1 pneumonia. In our experience, the best way to differentiate H1N1 from ILIs or other bacterial CAPs is through the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for H1N1 pneumonia or its rapid simplified version, ie, the diagnostic swine influenza triad. Legionnaires' disease is the atypical CAP pathogen most likely to mimic H1N1 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this and other nine cases at our institution during the herald wave of pandemic, we conclude that Legionnaires' disease may mimic swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia.","output":"Legionnaires' disease mimicking swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia during the herald wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to examine high-intensity interval training (HIIT) programs and a moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) program, which are frequently used in cardiac rehabilitation programs in terms of their effects on the functional capacity and quality of life of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The study included 20 patients with CAD (mean age, 60.95  5.08 years) who had undergone revascularization surgery. The participants were randomized into HIIT-short, HIIT-long, and MICT groups. All the groups participated in a 24-session exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program. The participants' exercise capacity was evaluated using the maximal exercise test and estimated VO2max values, functional capacity using the 6-min walk test (6MWT), and quality of life using the Short Form-36 survey and MacNew Heart Disease Health-related Quality of Life (MacNew) questionnaire. It was determined that the estimated VO2max values statistically significantly improved after treatment (P < 0.05), and both HIIT groups were superior to the MICT group (P < 0.05). Only the HIIT groups achieved the minimal clinically important difference in the 6MWT distance. After treatment, only the MICT group had a statistically significant improvement in quality of life. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in relation to the improvement in the 6MWT distance and quality of life (P > 0.05).

We present our real world experience with Itolizumab, a repurposed immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody, administered in COVID-19 patients. Methodology Data from 25 confirmed moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients, with high levels of pro-inflammatory markers and pulmonary function worsening on best supportive care and Itolizumab were included in this analysis. Patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were excluded. Clinical parameters (oxygen requirement) and laboratory parameters (ferritin, interleukin [IL]-6, C-reactive protein [CRP] and absolute lymphocyte count [ALC]) were studied preand post-treatment. Average total length of stay in hospital and ICU, percentage of patients requiring ICU admission and average time taken for weaning off oxygen for all patients were also reported. Results All Patients were in the range of 30-78 years of age, with majority being male (76%). Most prevalent comorbid conditions were diabetes (64%) and hypertension (28%). Median IL-6 value showed a decline by 85.4%. Significant reduction in median CRP (86.96%) and Ferritin (55.61%) was observed post- Itolizumab compared to pre-dose values. Median ALC improved from 1605 cells/ mm3 (pre-dose) to 2462.5 cells/mm3 (post-dose). Average recovery time, defined as time from Itolizumab infusion to discharge was 9.28  4.04 days. Average duration of hospitalization and ICU admission was 14.24  4.15 and 8.27  4.47 days, respectively, with 76% patients recovered and discharged. Median oxygen saturation improved from 88 % (pre-dose) to 96 % (post-dose). All patients were weaned off oxygen within Avg + SD : 6.53  2.09 days post-Itolizumab treatment. One and two point reduction in ordinal scale was observed in 88% and 76% patients, respectively. Three patients (12%) did not show improvement in ordinal sore of which two patients died because of complications due to pre-existing comorbidities. The all-cause mortality of 8%; was considered not related to Itolizumab. One infusion related event reported abated with infusion period extension. Interpretation and Conclusion A single dose of Itolizumab accelerated recovery in adult patients with COVID-19 by controlling immune hyperactivation. The clinical improvement was demonstrated by reduction in inflammatory markers, weaning off oxygen, reduced length of hospital stay and improvement of ordinal score.

METHODS: Between February 20, 2020 and April 4, 2020, consecutive confirmed 2541 COVID-19 patients from three designated hospitals were enrolled in this study. All patients received chest computed tomography (CT) and serological examinations at admission. Laboratory tests included routine blood tests, liver function, renal function, coagulation profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and arterial blood gas. The SaO2 was measured using pulse oxygen saturation in room air at resting status. Independent high-risk factors associated with death were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model. A prognostic nomogram was constructed to predict the survival of severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: There were 124 severe patients in the training cohort, and there were 71 and 76 severe patients in the two independent validation cohorts, respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that age &#8805; 70 years (HR = 1.184, 95% CI 1.061-1.321), panting (breathing rate &#8805; 30/min) (HR = 3.300, 95% CI 2.509-6.286), lymphocyte count < 1.0  109/L (HR = 2.283, 95% CI 1.779-3.267), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 10 pg/ml (HR = 3.029, 95% CI 1.567-7.116) were independent high-risk factors associated with fatal outcome. We developed the nomogram for identifying survival of severe COVID-19 patients in the training cohort (AUC = 0.900, 95% CI 0.841-0.960, sensitivity 95.5%, specificity 77.5%); in validation cohort 1 (AUC = 0.811, 95% CI 0.763-0.961, sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 73.5%); in validation cohort 2 (AUC = 0.862, 95% CI 0.698-0.924, sensitivity 92.9%, specificity 64.5%). The calibration curve for probability of death indicated a good consistence between prediction by the nomogram and the actual observation.

Of those who had participated in online exercise, 67.0% said they would participate in an online exercise class outside of a pandemic time. Participants like the following aspects better about online exercise: no transportation arrangements, it doesnt matter what they wear, no travel time, and they like to exercise without others seeing them. However, they also miss being with and socializing with others, and they reported feeling unsafe when the instructor cannot see them. Of those who did not participate online, several reasons were given: they prefer to exercise with others in the same room, they prefer to exercise with an instructor directly present, no appropriate device, and their internet is not reliable.

This article summarizes the clinical treatment process and clinical data of patients with COVID-19 and analyzes the predictive factors for mechanical ventilation for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out from January 5, 2020, to March 23, 2020, including 98 patients with COVID-19 treated at three designated hospitals in Huangshi City, Hubei Province. Data collection included demographics, previous underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, imaging examination results, diagnosis, and prognosis. This study presents a summary of the patients' overall clinical characteristics and clarifies the predictive factors for MV in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 56 males and 42 females included in this study. The mortality rate was 26.53% (26/98). Fever, cough, and chest tightness were the most common symptoms (64.3%, 37.8%, and 12.2%, respectively). Thirty cases required MV, 30.61% of the total cases, and the mortality rate was 73.33%. The univariate comparison showed that dyspnea, acute physiologic assessment, chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score, and the ratio between arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and oxygen concentration (FiO2) (P/F) were statistically different between the MV group and the non-MV group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed the following: dyspnea; increased white blood cell count; decreased platelets; lowered albumin levels; increased urea nitrogen; increased levels of myocardial enzymes Creatine Kinase (CK), Creatine Kinase, MB Form (CKMB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); increased lactate, and lowered blood calcium tests. These findings may indicate that the patients have an increased probability of needing MV support. A cutoff value for the initial APACHE II score of >11.5 and the initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <122.17 mmHg should be considered for MV support for patients with COVID-19.","output":"Predictors of mechanical ventilation for COVID-19: combined data from three designated hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, but effective antiviral therapies are not widely available.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if LNPs could efficiently deliver siRNA to neurons. Because of their potential utility in either applications in the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, we used both cortical neurons and sensory neurons.

We demonstrated using dynamic light scattering that the inclusion of both siRNA and PEG-lipid provided a stabilizing effect to the LNP particle diameters and polydispersity indices by minimizing aggregation. We found that siRNA-LNPs were safely tolerated by primary dorsal root ganglion neurons. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Cy5 siRNA delivered via LNPs into rat primary cortical neurons showed uptake levels similar to Lipofectamine RNAiMAXthe gold standard commercial transfection agent. However, LNPs demonstrated a superior safety profile whereas the Lipofectamine-mediated uptake was concomitant with significant toxicity.

However, it is unknown whether patients with biomarker elevation exhibit long-lasting abnormalities in cardiac function. PURPOSE: To determine, using advanced echocardiography, the prevalence and type of cardiovascular sequelae after COVID19 infection with marked elevation of cardiovascular biomarkers (CVB), and their prognostic implications. METHODS: All patients admitted from March 1st to May 25th, 2020 to a tertiary referral hospital were included. Patients with cardiovascular disease antecedent, death during admission, or the first 30 days after discharge were excluded. Patients with hs-TnI >45 ng/L, NT-proBNP >300 pg/ml, and D-dimer >8000 ng/ml were separated based on each CVB elevation and matched with COVID controls (three biomarkers within the normal range) based on intensive care requirements and age. RESULTS: From a total of 2025 hospitalized COVID19 patients, 80 patients with significantly elevated CVB and 29 controls were finally included. No differences in baseline characteristics were observed among groups, but elevated CVB patients were sicker. Follow-up echocardiograms showed no differences among groups regarding LVEF or RV diameters, but TAPSE was lower if hs-TnI or D-dimer were elevated. Hs-TnI patients also had lower global myocardial work and global longitudinal strain. The presence of an abnormal echocardiogram was more frequent in the elevated CVB group compared to controls (23.8 vs 10.3%, P=0.123) but mainly associated with mild abnormalities in deformation parameters.

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, pediatric inpatients with MPP were included from the Shanghai Children's Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia cohort study between August 2014 and July 2019. The multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score matching were used to investigate the effects of low-dose corticosteroid treatment on fever duration after admission, total fever duration, length of hospital stay, C-reactive protein recovery time, and imaging recovery time with the stratification of severe pneumonia, refractory pneumonia, inflammatory biomarkers, pulmonary images, and timing of corticosteroids. Results: There were 548 patients in the corticosteroid group and 337 in the no-corticosteroid group. The corticosteroid group showed severe clinical parameters such as more severe and refractory cases, higher laboratory values, and more abnormal imaging manifestations. The corticosteroid group also showed longer fever duration after admission [odds ratio (OR) = 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2C3.1), P = 0.008], longer total fever duration [OR = 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1C2.3), P = 0.011], longer hospital stay [OR = 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9C4.0), P < 0.001], and longer C-reactive protein (CRP) recovery time [OR = 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1C3.9), P = 0.021] in the regression model after the adjustment for severity. Although low-dose corticosteroids were associated with shortened imaging recovery time in patients with high level laboratory values, pulmonary imaging could be completely recovered in both groups. The trend of these results was consistent even after stratifications and a propensity scores matching analysis.

METHODS: To report all-cause deaths among Tianjin residents from 1999 through 2004, we standardized mortality rates to the world population in 2000. We analyzed age, sex, and geographic distribution of deaths from different causes and the leading causes of death in Tianjin. RESULTS: The 5 leading causes of death in Tianjin were cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignant neoplasm, chronic lower respiratory disease, and injuries and poisoning. Mortality in Tianjin declined from 0.60% in 1999 to 0.48% in 2004. Noncommunicable diseases accounted for more than 80% of all deaths. Infant and maternal mortality in Tianjin were low. Life expectancy of Tianjin residents increased every year but was consistently longer in women. When deaths from the main chronic diseases are not considered, life expectancy lengthens substantially.

For the Poisson regression model, several prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared through simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of forecasting daily and cumulative deaths in the United States (US) due to COVID-19. To examine their performance relative to what actually happened, daily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative deaths by June 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data relative to the Poisson regression model. An over-dispersed Poisson regression model is therefore proposed. This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival Analysis and over-dispersion is quantified through an additional parameter. The Poisson regression model is a hidden model in this over-dispersed Poisson regression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion parameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number of US deaths due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is presented.

We developed a machine learning algorithm, based on deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), for continuous management of oxygen flow rate for critically ill patients under intensive care, which can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong potentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice. METHODS: We modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their health outcomes as a Markov decision process. Based on individual patient characteristics and health status, an optimal oxygen control policy is learned by using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to reduce the mortality rate. We assessed the performance of proposed methods through cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1372 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021. RESULTS: The mean mortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than the standard of care by 2.57% (95% CI: 2.08C3.06) reduction (P < 0.001) from 7.94% under the standard of care to 5.37% under our proposed algorithm. The averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is 1.28 L/min (95% CI: 1.14C1.42) lower than the rate delivered to patients. Thus, the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive care treatment that can reduce the mortality rate, while saving the oxygen scarce resources. It can reduce the oxygen shortage issue and improve public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A personalized reinforcement learning oxygen flow control algorithm for COVID-19 patients under intensive care showed a substantial reduction in 7-day mortality rate as compared to the standard of care.

It is a decision that calls for a wisdom that properly sees this action within the constellation of actions that propels the human agent to the heights of holiness. This is why prayer is so essential for authentic moral judgment. With prayer, we ask the Holy Spirit who is the all-prudent one to guide our actions so that we can choose and act well not only for our only well-being but for the well-being of all. Acts that are not themselves intrinsically evil are deemed virtuous or not within the narrative of the individual persons life.","output":"Prudential Use of the Morally Controversial COVID-19 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent ERJ editorial cited ACE2 upregulation as a key reason for the better outcomes of COVID-19 seen in paediatric patients.

The objective was to evaluate whether surgical oncology and medical oncology clinics, which have different operating styles, impact the timeliness of treatment. Additionally, we investigated the prognostic impact of the clinical and treatment-related factors in patients with esophageal cancer treated at our center. Methods This was a retrospective single-center study. The prognostic impact of resection type (R0 or R1-2), multimodal treatment, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), lymph node metastases, cachexia at the time of diagnosis, smoking, and diagnostic application of endoscopic ultrasound was evaluated. Patients were stratified according to whether the orientation and management processes were based on a multimodal approach and whether they were first examined by a surgical oncologist or a medical oncologist for diagnostic workup and management. The impact of the management approach on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated. Results Use of a multimodal approach in patients with esophageal cancer was associated with longer PFS (26.7 vs 13.9 months, p = 0.002). LVI and cachexia were associated with shorter PFS (16.1 vs 29.4 months, p = 0.044 and 14.6 vs 29.0, p = 0.019, respectively). The first appointment of the patients in the medical oncology department was associated with shorter treatment delay (54 [IQR: 36-71] vs 31 [IQR: 24-48] days, p < 0.001). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the first appointment of patients in the medical oncology department may lead to a more systematic workup and treatment progress. We believe that systematic use of multimodal approaches for esophageal cancer may confer prognostic benefits.","output":"Medical Oncology or Surgical Oncology: Which Branch Should Be Started in Esophageal Cancer Diagnostic Evaluation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The long-term effects caused by COVID-19 are unknown. The present study aims to assess factors associated with health-related quality of life and long-term outcomes among survivors of hospitalization for COVID-19 in Brazil. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective cohort study nested in five randomized clinical trials designed to assess the effects of specific COVID-19 treatments in over 50 centers in Brazil. Adult survivors of hospitalization due to proven or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection will be followed-up for a period of 1 year by means of structured telephone interviews. The primary outcome is the 1-year utility score of health-related quality of life assessed by the EuroQol-5D3L. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, rehospitalizations, return to work or study, physical functional status assessed by the Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, dyspnea assessed by the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, need for long-term ventilatory support, symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and self-rated health assessed by the EuroQol-5D3L Visual Analog Scale. Generalized estimated equations will be performed to test the association between five sets of variables (1- demographic characteristics, 2- premorbid state of health, 3- characteristics of acute illness, 4- specific COVID-19 treatments received, and 5- time-updated postdischarge variables) and outcomes.

To investigate the occurrence and distribution of OPEs in various environments in China, this review collects and discusses the published scientific studies in this field. Chlorinated OPEs, as flame retardants, are the predominant OPEs found in the environment. The analysis of data revealed large concentration variations among microenvironments, including inflowing river water (range: 0.69C10.62 gL(?1)), sediments (range: 0.0197C0.234 g/g), dust (range: 8.706C34.872 g/g), and open recycling sites soil (range: 0.122C2.1 g/g). Moreover, OPEs can be detected in the air and biota. We highlight the overall view regarding environmental levels of OPEs in different matrices as a starting point to monitor trends for China. The levels of OPEs in the water, sediment, dust, and air of China are still low. However, dust samples from electronic waste workshop sites were more contaminated. Human activities, pesticides, electronics, furniture, paint, plastics and textiles, and wastewater plants are the dominant sources of OPEs. Human exposure routes to OPEs mainly include dermal contact, dust ingestion, inhalation, and dietary intake. The low level of ecological risk and risk to human health indicated a limited threat from OPEs. Furthermore, current challenges and perspectives for future studies are prospected.

We administered a social needs screening tool and needs assessment survey to assess SDOH and evaluate for trends in the population of patients visiting our ED. METHODS: A survey was distributed via convenience sampling to adult ED patients to capture self-reported demographic information and data about social needs. We categorized the questions related to SDOH based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding format and created a composite variable called SDOH Strata based on the SDOH Index scores (0C5-low, 6C10-middle, or 11-high). We conducted bivariate analyses using the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and their SDOH Strata using Fishers exact test. We then conducted multinomial logistic regression to examine the association between the patients sociodemographic characteristics and the SDOH Strata. RESULTS: A total of 269 surveys were collected. We observed that Hispanic/Latino patients were more than two times as likely (odds ratio: 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12,?6.51) to be in the higher impact stratum than in the lower impact stratum. Those who were undocumented had 3.43 times increased adjusted odds (95% CI, 1.98, 9.53) of being in the higher than the lower impact stratum compared to US citizens.

Current acute treatments for migraine in adolescents are mostly pharmacological and may have limited effectiveness, can cause side effects, and may lead to medication overuse. There is an unmet need for effective and well-tolerated treatments. Remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) is a novel acute treatment of migraine that stimulates upper arm peripheral nerves to induce conditioned pain modulation (CPM)-an endogenous analgesic mechanism. The REN device (Nerivio? , Theranica Bio-Electronics Ltd., Israel) is a FDA-authorized device for acute treatment of migraine in adults. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of REN in adolescents with migraine. DESIGN AND METHODS This was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in adolescents (ages 12-17 years) with migraine. Participants underwent a 4-week run-in phase. Eligible participants continued to an 8-week treatment phase with the device. Pain severity, associated symptoms, and functional disability were recorded at treatment initiation, and 2 and 24 hours post-treatment. The primary endpoints of this study were related to the safety and tolerability of REN. The secondary endpoints were related to device efficacy and included the proportion of participants who achieved pain relief at 2 hours post-treatment and the proportion of participants who achieved pain freedom at 2 hours. The presented results reflect an interim analysis with subsequent stopping of the rest of the study. RESULTS Sixty participants were enrolled for the study; of these, 14 failed to meet the run-in criteria and 1 was lost to follow-up. Forty-five participants performed at least one treatment, of which 39 participants completed a test treatment with REN. One device-related adverse event (2%) was reported in which a temporary feeling of pain in the arm was felt. Pain relief and pain-free at 2 hours were achieved by 71% (28/39) and 35% (14/39) participants, respectively. At 2 hours, 69% (23/33) participants experienced improvement in functional ability.

How cells maintain Fe-S cluster homeostasis is not well understood in Gram-positive bacteria. Genomic analysis showed that the Suf system, which is encoded by the sufRBDCSU operon, is the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in the genus Streptomyces Streptomyces avermitilis is the industrial producer of avermectins, which are widely used as agricultural pesticides and antiparasitic agents. sufR (SAV6324) encodes a putative ArsR-family transcriptional regulator, which was characterized as a repressor of the sufRBDCSU operon in this investigation. Spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrated that anaerobically isolated SufR contained an oxidation-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster and existed as a homodimer. EMSAs and DNase I footprinting analyses revealed that [4Fe-4S]-SufR bound specifically and tightly to a 14-bp palindromic sequence (CAAC-N6-GTTG) in the promoter region of the sufR operon, repressing expression of the sufRBDCSU operon. The presence of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is critical for the DNA binding activity of SufR. Cys182, Cys195, and Cys223 in the C-terminal region of SufR are essential for [4Fe-4S] cluster coordination, but Cys178 is not. The fourth non-Cys ligand in coordination of the [4Fe-4S] cluster for SufR remains to be identified. The findings clarify the transcriptional control of the suf operon by [4Fe-4S] SufR to satisfy the varying Fe-S cluster demands. SufR senses the intracellular Fe-S cluster status and modulates the expression of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system via its Fe-S cluster occupancy.Importance Fe-S clusters function as cofactors of proteins controlling diverse biological processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, DNA replication and gene regulation. The mechanism of how Actinobacteria regulate the expression of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in response to the varying Fe-S cluster demands remains to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that SufR functions as a transcriptional repressor of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in the avermectin-producer S. avermitilis [4Fe-4S]-SufR binds to the promoter region of the suf operon and represses its expression. When Fe-S cluster is insufficient, SufR loses its [4Fe-4S] cluster and DNA binding activity. Apo-SufR dissociates from the promoter region of suf operon, and the expression of the suf system is strongly increased by de-repression to promote the synthesis of Fe-S clusters. The study clarifies how Streptomyces maintains its Fe-S cluster homeostasis through the activity of SufR to modulate the varying Fe-S cluster demands.","output":"SufR, a [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing transcription factor, represses the sufRBDCSU operon in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in Streptomyces avermitilis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine has emerged as a vital tool for continuing to provide therapy to children with disabilities throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We adapted a contemporary model of the population profile of symptomatic and asymptomatic severe AS in Europe and North America to estimate the number of people aged 55 years in the UK who might benefit from surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). RESULTS: With a point prevalence of 1.48%, we estimate that 291 448 men and women aged 55 years in the UK had severe AS in 2019. Of these, 68.3% (199 059, 95% CI 1 77 201 to 221 355 people) would have been symptomatic and, therefore, more readily treated according to their surgical risk profile; the remaining 31.7% of cases (92 389, 95% CI 70 093 to 144 247) being asymptomatic. Based on historical patterns of intervention, 58.4% (116 251, 95% CI 106 895 to 1 25 606) of the 199 059 symptomatic cases would qualify for SAVR, with 7208 (95% CI 7091 to 7234) being assessed as being in a high, preoperative surgical risk category. Among the remaining 41.6% (82 809, 95% CI 73 453 to 92 164) of cases potentially unsuitable for SAVR, an estimated 61.7% (51 093, 95% CI 34 780 to 67 655) might be suitable for TAVI. We estimate that 172 859 out of 291 448 prevalent cases of severe AS (59.3%) will subsequently die within 5 years without proactive management.

Most of these toxicities develop insidiously. However, in rare cases, these toxicities manifest with more acute symptoms. We present an unusual case of amiodarone toxicity which manifested with multiorgan failure and systemic inflammatory response syndrome that mimicked sepsis. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old man who was being treated with chronic oral amiodarone for atrial fibrillation presented with flu-like symptoms and fever, pulmonary infiltrate, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. The patient did not improve with antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. The results of an extensive infectious and non-infectious workup were negative. His symptoms worsened during hospitalization, which correlated with the loading of intravenous amiodarone given for his acute worsening of atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone-induced drug toxicity was contemplated by the treating medical team. Amiodarone was stopped, and the patient was treated with steroids, which improved his symptoms and organ dysfunctions. Subsequent bronchoscopy with lung biopsy showed foamy macrophages with organizing pneumonia and fibrinoid changes. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights an atypical and rare presentation of a complication of chronic amiodarone use that presented with acute onset of fever, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multiorgan failure masquerading as sepsis.

The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2.

DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: We used pseudonymised medical record data provided by six general hospitals from the HM Hospitales group in Spain. OUTCOME MEASURES: Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify variables associated with mortality and the composite of mortality or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in the overall population, and stratified for the presence or absence of DM. Spline analysis was conducted on the entire population to investigate the relationship between glucose levels at admission and outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 1621 individuals without DM and 448 with DM were identified in the database. Patients with DM were on average 5.1 years older than those without. The overall in-hospital mortality was 18.6% (N=301), and was higher among patients with DM than those without (26.3% vs 11.3%; p<0.001). DM was independently associated with death, and death or IMV (OR=2.33, 95% CI: 1.7 to 3.1 and OR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.6 to 2.8, respectively; p<0.001). In subjects with DM, the only variables independently associated with both outcomes were age >65 years, male sex and pre-existing chronic kidney disease. We observed a non-linear relationship between blood glucose levels at admission and risk of in-hospital mortality and death or IMV. The highest probability for each outcome (around 50%) was at random glucose of around 550 mg/dL (30.6 mmol/L), and the risks flattened above this value. CONCLUSION: The results confirm the high burden associated with DM in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection, particularly among men, the elderly and those with impaired kidney function.

We evaluate the question of non-White distancing using social mobility data from Google on three sites: workplaces, grocery stores, and recreational locations. Employing hierarchical linear modeling and geographically weighted regression, we find the relation of race/ethnicity to COVID-19 distancing is varied across the United States.

However, the GWR models show there are places where the percent Black is locally related to recreation distancing while percent Hispanic is not. Further, these models show the association of percent Black to recreation and grocery distancing can be locally as strong as 1.057 percent (p < 0.05) and 0.989 percent (p < 0.05), respectively.

Risks to health and even life are being confronted by workers in health and social care, as well as those in roles previously never defined as frontline, such as individuals working in community supply chain sectors. The strategy adopted by the UK government in facing the challenges of the pandemic was markedly different from other countries. The present study set out to examine what variables were associated with resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in all sectors of frontline workers, and whether or not these differed between the UK and Republic of Ireland (RoI). Individuals were eligible if they were a frontline worker (in health and social care, community supply chain, or other emergency services) in the UK or RoI during the pandemic. Part of a larger, longitudinal study, the participants completed an online survey to assess various aspects of their daily and working lives, along with their attitudes towards their governments handling of the crisis, and measurement of psychological variables associated with heroism (altruism, meaning in life, and resilient coping). A total of 1305 participants (N=869, 66.6% from the UK) provided sufficient data for analysis. UK-based workers reported lower wellbeing than the RoI-based participants. In multivariate models, both psychological and pandemic-related variables were associated with levels of resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in these workers, but which pandemic-related variables were associated with outcomes differed depending on the country. The judgment of lower timeliness in their governments response to the pandemic appeared to be a key driver of each outcome for the UK-based frontline workers. These findings provide initial evidence that the different strategies adopted by each country may be associated with the overall wellbeing of frontline workers, with higher detriment observed in the UK. The judgment of the relatively slow response of the UK government to instigate their pandemic measures appears to be associated with lower resilience, higher burnout, and lower wellbeing in frontline workers in the UK.","output":"Grace Under Pressure: Resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in frontline workers in the UK and Ireland during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has resulted in a pandemic1. The C5a complement factor and its receptor C5aR1 (also known as CD88) have a key role in the initiation and maintenance of several inflammatory responses by recruiting and activating neutrophils and monocytes1. Here we provide a longitudinal analysis of immune responses, including phenotypic analyses of immune cells and assessments of the soluble factors that are present in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients at various stages of COVID-19 severity, including those who were paucisymptomatic or had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The levels of soluble C5a were increased in proportion to the severity of COVID-19 and high expression levels of C5aR1 receptors were found in blood and pulmonary myeloid cells, which supports a role for the C5a-C5aR1 axis in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Anti-C5aR1 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies prevented the C5a-mediated recruitment and activation of human myeloid cells, and inhibited acute lung injury in human C5aR1 knock-in mice. These results suggest that blockade of the C5a-C5aR1 axis could be used to limit the infiltration of myeloid cells in damaged organs and prevent the excessive lung inflammation and endothelialitis that are associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Association of COVID-19 inflammation with activation of the C5a-C5aR1 axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sickness presenteeism involves employees continuing to work while unwell. As presenteeism is influenced by contextual and individual difference factors, it is important to assess its prevalence and implications for wellbeing and productivity in different occupational groups. This study examines these issues in a sample of prison officers working in UK institutions. Data were obtained from a survey of 1956 prison officers. Measures assessed the prevalence of and reasons for presenteeism and the perceived impact on job performance, along with mental health and perceptions of workplace safety climate. More than nine respondents out of ten (92%) reported working while unwell at least sometimes, with 43% reporting that they always did so. Presenteeism frequency was significantly related to mental health symptoms, impaired job performance and a poorer workplace safety climate. The reasons provided for presenteeism explained 31% of the variance in self-reported mental health, 34% in job performance and 17% in workplace safety climate, but the pattern of predictors varied according to the outcome.

Real-time RT - PCR (Reverse transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) is used to amplify the viral RNA and enable its detection. Although PCR is 37 years old, it is still considered, without dispute, as the gold standard. PCR is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in DNA amplification, microfluidics and membrane technologies, we succeeded to create a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT - LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or highly fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using pools of naso-pharyngal clinical samples, we estimated a sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR (up to a Cycle threshold of 39, equivalent to <0.1 TCID50 per mL) and a 100% specificity, for other human coronaviruses and eight respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called COVIDISC to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment paves the way towards a large dissemination of this device. The perspective of a reliable SARS-CoV-2 point of care detection, highly performing, that would deliver on-site results in less than one hour opens up a new efficient approach to manage the pandemics.","output":"Highly performing point-of-care molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 with RNA extraction and isothermal amplification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A dramatic SARS-Cov-2 outbreak is hitting Italy hard.

Preoperative embolization of the left gastric artery and splenic artery (PAE) has been suggested to lower anastomotic leak rates. We present the results of our 5-year experience with this technique. METHODS All patients undergoing PAE before esophagectomy since introduction of this technique in 2004 were compared in a 1:2 matched-pair analysis with patients without PAE. Matching criteria were type of anastomosis, neoadjuvant treatment, comorbidity, and age. Data were derived from a retrospective chart review from 2000 to 2006 that was perpetuated as a prospective database up to date. Outcome measures were anastomotic leak, overall complications, and hospital stay. RESULTS Between 2000 and 2009, 102 patients underwent esophagectomy for cancer in our institution with an overall leak rate of 19% and a mortality of 8%. All 19 patients having PAE since 2004 were successfully matched 1:2 to 38 control patients without PAE; both groups were similar regarding demographics and operation characteristics. Two PAE (11%) and 8 control patients (21%) had an anastomotic leak, but the difference was statistically not significant (p=0.469). Overall and major complication rates for PAE and control group were 89% versus 79% (p=0.469) and 37% versus 34% (p=1.000), respectively. Median intensive care unit and hospital stay were 3 versus 3 days (p=1.000) and 22 versus 17 days (p=0.321), respectively.

METHODS: Through Twitter streaming Application Programming Interface (API), COVID-19-related tweets were collected from March 5 (th) , 2020 to January 25 (th) , 2021 using relevant keywords (such as corona, covid19, and covid). Based on geolocation information provided in tweets and vaccine-related keywords (such as vaccine and vaccination), we identified COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets from the US. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were performed to examine public perception and discussion of COVID-19 vaccines. Demographic inference using computer vision algorithm (DeepFace) was performed to infer the demographic characteristics (age, gender and race/ethnicity) of Twitter users who tweeted about COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: Our longitudinal analysis showed that the discussion of COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter in the US reached a peak at the end of 2020. Average sentiment score for COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets remained relatively stable during our study period except for two big peaks, the positive peak corresponds to the optimism about the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the negative peak corresponds to worrying about the availability of COVID-19 vaccines.

Maintaining oxygen homeostasis represents the essential cellular metabolic process for the structural integrity of tissues in different pathological conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To date, several studies revealed the benefic effects of hypoxic preconditioning in ischemia, kidney failure and in pulmonary function recovery of lung surgery patients. HPC increases the expression of factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, induces an anti-inflammatory outcome, triggers coordinated hypoxia responses that promote erythropoiesis, and mobilizes the circulating progenitor cells. Futhermore, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exposed to HPC show improvement of their regenerative capacities, and increases the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in different pathologies, including COVID-19. In conclusion, HPC should be considered an approach with beneficial outcomes and without significant side effects when the organism is severely exposed to the same stressor.

The survey targeted hospital pharmacists (HPs), physicians (PHYs), nurses (NRS) and other healthcare professionals (OHCPs). A separate set of questions addressed patients (PTNs). METHODS A 28-question survey was conducted by EAHP, collecting information from European HPs, PTNs, NRS, PHYs and OHCPs on the shortage situation in their respective countries. The survey ran from 7 November 2019 to 13 January 2020. The results were analysed by EAHP. RESULTS There were 2136 HP responses to the 2019 survey compared with 1666 in 2018. While 95% of HPs and 89% of OHCPs consider medicine shortages a current problem, only 71% of PHYs and 62% of NRS state the same. Shortages of active pharmaceutical ingredients (72%), manufacturing (72%) and supply chain problems (49%) are leading causes of shortages according to HPs, while PHYs (40%) and NRS (37%) consider the pricing to be their driver. Antimicrobials and oncology medicines were most affected by shortages in 2019. Compared to 2018, the percentage of respondents who reported shortages of oncology medicines increased from 39% to 47% in 2019. HPs (42%), PHYs (36%) and OHCPs (38%) consider delays in care as the main consequence of medication shortages. The satisfaction with reporting systems for medicine shortages decreased from 56% in 2018 to 48% in 2019 for HPs, while they remain low for PHYs (36%).

A cyclopropyl-acyl sulfonamide moiety was found to be the optimal element at the P(1)-P(1) interface enhancing the potency of carboxylic acid-based prototypes by 10- to >100-fold, dependent upon the specific background. Optimization for oral bioavailability identified a 1-substituted isoquinoline-based P(2)* element that conferred a significant exposure advantage in rats compared to the matched 4-substituted quinoline isomer. BMS-605339 (30) was the first cyclopropyl-acyl sulfonamide derivative advanced into clinical trials that demonstrated dose-related reductions in plasma viral RNA in HCV-infected patients. However, 30 was associated with cardiac events observed in a normal healthy volunteer (NHV) and an HCV-infected patient that led to the suspension of the development program. Using a Langendorff rabbit heart model, a limited structure-cardiac liability relationship was quickly established that led to the discovery of 1. This compound, which differs from 30 only by changes in the substitution pattern of the P(2)* isoquinoline heterocycle and the addition of a single chlorine atom to the molecular formula, gave a dose-dependent reduction in plasma viral RNA following oral administration to HCV-infected patients without the burden of the cardiac events that had been observed with 30.

METHODS: We screened 3915 tweets from public Twitter profiles in Canada by using the search words vaccine and COVID. The tweets that met the inclusion criteria (ie, those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy) were coded via content analysis. Codes were then organized into themes and interpreted by using the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: Overall, 605 tweets were identified as those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy stemmed from the following themes: concerns over safety, suspicion about political or economic forces driving the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccine development, a lack of knowledge about the vaccine, antivaccine or confusing messages from authority figures, and a lack of legal liability from vaccine companies. This study also examined mistrust toward the medical industry not due to hesitancy, but due to the legacy of communities marginalized by health care institutions. These themes were categorized into the following five Theoretical Domains Framework constructs: knowledge, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, social influence, and emotion. CONCLUSIONS: With the World Health Organization stating that one of the worst threats to global health is vaccine hesitancy, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind this reluctance. By using a behavioral science framework, this study adds to the emerging knowledge about vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing public discourse in tweets in real time.

METHODS: Using 16 years of nationally representative hospital-level data from the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, we employed a difference-in-difference design to compare changes in productive hours per patient day for registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs), and nursing assistive personnel (NAP) in the state that mandated staffing ratios, states that legislated staffing committees, and states that legislated public reporting, to changes in states that did not implement any nurse staffing legislation before and after the legislation was implemented. We constructed multivariate linear regression models to assess the effects with hospital and year fixed effects, controlling for hospital-level characteristics and state-level factors. RESULTS: Compared with states with no legislation, the state that legislated minimum staffing ratios had an 0.996 (P<0.01) increase in RN hours per patient day and 0.224 (P<0.01) increase in NAP hours after the legislation was implemented, but no statistically significant changes in RN or NAP hours were found in states that legislated a staffing committee or public reporting. The staffing committee approach had a negative effect on LPN hours (difference-in-difference=?0.076, P<0.01), while the public reporting approach had a positive effect on LPN hours (difference-in-difference=0.115, P<0.01). There was no statistically significant effect of staffing mandate on LPN hours. CONCLUSIONS: When we included California in the comparison, our model suggests that neither the staffing committee nor the public reporting approach alone are effective in increasing hospital RN staffing, although the public reporting approach appeared to have a positive effect on LPN staffing. When we excluded California form the model, public reporting also had a positive effect on RN staffing.

Accurate diagnosis and attribution of the causes of pneumonia are important for measuring the burden of disease, implementing appropriate preventive or treatment strategies, and developing more effective interventions. This review summarizes recent diagnostic advances in radiological techniques, specimen collection, and laboratory methods. Although chest ultrasound and chest magnetic resonance imaging are promising modalities for radiological diagnosis, their role in clinical management and their impact on outcomes need further study. Rapid, highly sensitive, multiplex laboratory tests performed on upper respiratory tract samples or induced sputum can detect nucleic acid from potential pathogens in most children with pneumonia. However, it may be difficult to attribute causality because it is often impossible to distinguish between organisms colonizing or infecting the upper respiratory tract and those causing pneumonia. Currently available host biomarkers lack accuracy for distinguishing bacterial or mixed bacterial-viral infections from viral infections. New biomarkers derived from host transcriptional profile analysis may be more accurate but require validation. Prospective studies with appropriate control populations, including studies of clinical impact, are needed to improve our understanding of the role of tests. Although progress has been made in radiological techniques and laboratory testing, current methods for diagnosing and attributing the causes of pneumonia are suboptimal.","output":"Advances in the diagnosis of pneumonia in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the persistence of immunogenicity three months after third dose boosters. METHODS: COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of seven COVID-19 vaccines used as a third booster dose. The analysis was conducted using all randomised participants who were SARS-CoV-2 na?ve during the study. RESULTS: Among the 2883 participants randomised, there were 2422 SARS-CoV-2 na?ve participants until D84 visit included in the analysis with median age of 70 (IQR: 30-94) years. In the participants who had two initial doses of ChAd, schedules using mRNA vaccines as third dose have the highest anti-spike IgG at D84 (e.g. geometric mean concentration of 8674 ELU/ml (95% CI: 7461-10085) following ChAd/ChAd/BNT). However, in people who had two initial doses of BNT there was no significant difference at D84 in people given ChAd versus BNT (geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 0.95 (95%CI: 0.78, 1.15). Also, people given Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen; hereafter referred to as Ad26) as a third dose had significantly higher anti-spike IgG at D84 than BNT (GMR of 1.20, 95%CI: 1.01,1.43). Responses at D84 between people who received BNT (15 g) or BNT (30 g) after ChAd/ChAd or BNT/BNT were similar, with anti-spike IgG GMRs of half-BNT (15 g) versus BNT (30 g) ranging between 0.74-0.86. The decay rate of cellular responses were similar between all the vaccine schedules and doses. CONCLUSIONS: 84 days after a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine the decay rates of humoral response were different between vaccines. Adenoviral vector vaccine anti-spike IgG concentration at D84 following BNT/BNT initial doses were higher than for a three dose (BNT/BNT/BNT) schedule. Half dose BNT immune responses were similar to full dose responses. While high antibody tires are desirable in situations of high transmission of new variants of concern, the maintenance of immune responses that confer long-lasting protection against severe disease or death is also of critical importance. Policymakers may also consider adenoviral vector, fractional dose of mRNA, or other non-mRNA vaccines as third doses.","output":"Persistence of immunogenicity after seven COVID-19 vaccines given as third dose boosters following two doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or BNT162b2 in the UK: three month analyses of the COV-BOOST trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The circular economy is considered by international institutions such as the United Nations and the European Union as the most urgent strategy to orient the economic development model towards sustainability.

Virtual healthcare was rapidly implemented but much is unknown about the quality of care provided in telehealth visits. We sought to describe changes in visits throughout the pandemic and evaluate the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing. Methods We utilized EHR data from a large health care system that provides primary care via pediatric, family medicine, and urgent care clinics. We included outpatient visits from 1/1/19 - 4/30/21 for children < 20 years. The COVID-19 era was defined as after March 2020. Visits were labeled as virtual according to coded encounter or visit type variables. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions was assigned using a previously published ICD-10 classification scheme that defines each prescription as appropriate, potentially appropriate, or inappropriate (Chua, et al. BMJ, 2019). Results There were 805,130 outpatient visits during the study period. The mean rate of antibiotic prescriptions in the pre-pandemic period was 23% (range 17-26% per month) and 11% (range 9-15%) in the COVID-19 era. Mean rates of inappropriate prescribing were 17% (range 14-20% per month) and 20% (range 19-22%), respectively (Figure 1). Coded virtual visits during the COVID-19 era were uncommon (1-2%) with the exception of April and May 2020 (11% and 5%, respectively). During the COVID-19 era, approximately 9% of telehealth visits resulted in antibiotics, compared to 11% of in-person visits (Table 1). Virtual visits had lower rates of inappropriate and appropriate prescribing, but higher rates of potentially appropriate prescribing (Table 1). Visits and associated antibiotic prescribing in the pre-pandemic and COVID-19 era Appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in the COVID-19 era, by visit type Conclusion Rates and volume of antibiotic prescribing in outpatient pediatric visits have declined in the COVID-19 era, while rates of inappropriate prescribing have increased slightly. Our study suggests use of telehealth for pediatric visits was minimal and led to higher prescribing rates for potentially appropriate indications. This could be explained by a lack of clinical certainty in conditions such as otitis media and pharyngitis in virtual visits. Disclosures Bethany A.

Outpatients from a tertiary cancer centre were enrolled. The adapted PRO interface allowed for uniform registration of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and effective triage of patients at home where we also implemented systematic throat washings, when available. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty patients registered to the telemonitoring systems from March 13 to May 15, 2020. Four prespecified SARS-CoV-2 alarms resulted in three patients with positive PCR testing. Other Covid-19 symptoms (fever 5 and cough 2) led to pretreatment triage resulting in 1 seroconversion after initial negative testing. One of the 477 throat washings proved positive.

The Chinese government implemented strong intervention measures in the early stage of the epidemic, including strict travel bans and social distancing policies. Prioritizing the analysis of different contributing factors to outbreak outcomes is important for the precise prevention and control of infectious diseases. We proposed a novel framework for resolving this issue and applied it to data from China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically identify national-level and city-level contributing factors to the control of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Daily COVID-19 case data and related multidimensional data, including travel-related, medical, socioeconomic, environmental, and influenza-like illness factors, from 343 cities in China were collected. A correlation analysis and interpretable machine learning algorithm were used to evaluate the quantitative contribution of factors to new cases and COVID-19 growth rates during the epidemic period (ie, January 17 to February 29, 2020). RESULTS: Many factors correlated with the spread of COVID-19 in China. Travel-related population movement was the main contributing factor for new cases and COVID-19 growth rates in China, and its contributions were as high as 77% and 41%, respectively. There was a clear lag effect for travel-related factors (previous vs current week: new cases, 45% vs 32%; COVID-19 growth rates, 21% vs 20%). Travel from non-Wuhan regions was the single factor with the most significant impact on COVID-19 growth rates (contribution: new cases, 12%; COVID-19 growth rate, 26%), and its contribution could not be ignored. City flow, a measure of outbreak control strength, contributed 16% and 7% to new cases and COVID-19 growth rates, respectively. Socioeconomic factors also played important roles in COVID-19 growth rates in China (contribution, 28%). Other factors, including medical, environmental, and influenza-like illness factors, also contributed to new cases and COVID-19 growth rates in China. Based on our analysis of individual cities, compared to Beijing, population flow from Wuhan and internal flow within Wenzhou were driving factors for increasing the number of new cases in Wenzhou. For Chongqing, the main contributing factor for new cases was population flow from Hubei, beyond Wuhan. The high COVID-19 growth rates in Wenzhou were driven by population-related factors. CONCLUSIONS: Many factors contributed to the COVID-19 outbreak outcomes in China. The differential effects of various factors, including specific city-level factors, emphasize the importance of precise, targeted strategies for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak and future infectious disease outbreaks.","output":"Impact of Systematic Factors on the Outbreak Outcomes of the Novel COVID-19 Disease in China: Factor Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While the risk of severe complications of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and its determinants have been explored in previous studies, a systematic analysis of published articles with different designs and populations has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the pooled estimate at 39.1%. The risks of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation ranged from 44.4 to 100% and from 25.0 to 100%, with pooled estimates at 78.2 and 73.0%, respectively. These risks showed a substantial heterogeneity among the identified studies, and appeared to be the highest in case studies focusing on ICU cases. We identified older age, male sex and underlying medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, renal disease, respiratory disease, heart disease and hypertension, as clinical predictors of death associated with MERS. In ICU case studies, the expected odds ratios (OR) of death among patients with underlying heart disease or renal disease to patients without such comorbidities were 0.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.1, 4.3) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.0, 2.1), respectively, while the ORs were 3.8 (95% CI: 3.4, 4.2) and 2.4 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.9), respectively, in studies with other types of designs. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity for the risk of death and severe manifestations was substantially high among the studies, and varying study designs was one of the underlying reasons for this heterogeneity.

Symptoms and signs could intuitively and non-invasively predict and monitor disease progression, especially for telemedicine, but related research is limited in diabetes and renal medicine. Methods: This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the predictive power of a symptom-based stratification framework and individual symptoms for diabetes. Three hundred two adult diabetic patients were consecutively sampled from outpatient clinics in Hong Kong for prospective symptom assessment. Demographics and longitudinal measures of biochemical parameters were retrospectively extracted from linked medical records. The association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (independent variable) and biochemistry, epidemiological factors, and individual symptoms was assessed by mixed regression analyses. A symptom-based stratification framework of diabetes using symptom clusters was formulated by Delphi consensus method. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were compared between statistical models with different combinations of biochemical, epidemiological, and symptom variables. Results: In the 4.2-year follow-up period, baseline presentation of edema (?1.8 ml/min/1.73m(2), 95%CI: ?2.5 to ?1.2, p < 0.001), epigastric bloating (?0.8 ml/min/1.73m(2), 95%CI: ?1.4 to ?0.2, p = 0.014) and alternating dry and loose stool (?1.1 ml/min/1.73m(2), 95%CI: ?1.9 to ?0.4, p = 0.004) were independently associated with faster annual GFR decline. Eleven symptom clusters were identified from literature, stratifying diabetes predominantly by gastrointestinal phenotypes. Using symptom clusters synchronized by Delphi consensus as the independent variable in statistical models reduced complexity and improved explanatory power when compared to using individual symptoms. Symptom-biologic-epidemiologic combined model had the lowest AIC (4,478 vs. 5,824 vs. 4,966 vs. 7,926) and BIC (4,597 vs. 5,870 vs. 5,065 vs. 8,026) compared to the symptom, symptom-epidemiologic and biologic-epidemiologic models, respectively.

With a growing demand for electrical energy storage materials, lignin-derived activated carbon (AC) materials have received increasing attention in recent years. However, there is an apparent gap in our understanding of the impact of the lignin precursors (i.e., lignin structure, composition and inter-unit linkages) on the structural and electrochemical properties of the derived ACs. In the present study, lignin-derived ACs were prepared under identical conditions from two different lignin sources: alkaline pretreated poplar and pine. The lignin precursors were characterized using composition analysis, size exclusion chromatography, and 2D HSQC nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Distinctive distributions of numerous micro-, meso- and macro-porous channels were observed in the two lignin-derived ACs. Poplar lignin-derived ACs exhibited a larger BET surface area and total mesopore volume than pine lignin-derived AC, which contributed to a larger electrochemical capacitance over a range of scan rates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis (XPS) results revealed the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups in all lignin-derived ACs, which participated in redox reactions and thus contributed to an additional pseudo-capacitance. A possible process mechanism was proposed to explain the effects of lignin structure and composition on lignin-derived AC pore structure during thermochemical conversion. This study provides insight into how the lignin composition and structure affect the derived ACs for energy storage applications.","output":"Linking lignin source with structural and electrochemical properties of lignin-derived carbon materials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The protection level offered by filtering facepiece particulate respirators and face masks is defined by the percentage of ambient particles penetrating inside the protection device. There are two penetration pathways: (1) through the faceseal leakage, and the (2) filter medium. This study aimed at differentiating the contributions of these two pathways for particles in the size range of 0.03C1 m under actual breathing conditions. One N95 filtering facepiece respirator and one surgical mask commonly used in health care environments were tested on 25 subjects (matching the latest National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fit testing panel) as the subjects performed conventional fit test exercises. The respirator and the mask were also tested with breathing manikins that precisely mimicked the prerecorded breathing patterns of the tested subjects. The penetration data obtained in the human subject- and manikin-based tests were compared for different particle sizes and breathing patterns. Overall, 5250 particle size- and exercise-specific penetration values were determined. For each value, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio was calculated to quantify the relative contributions of the two penetration pathways. The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage of the tested respirator/mask far exceeded the number of those penetrating through the filter medium. For the N95 respirator, the excess was (on average) by an order of magnitude and significantly increased with an increase in particle size (p < 0.001): 7-fold greater for 0.04 m, 10-fold for 0.1 m, and 20-fold for 1 m. For the surgical mask, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8 and was not significantly affected by the particle size for the tested submicrometer fraction. Facial/body movement had a pronounced effect on the relative contribution of the two penetration pathways. Breathing intensity and facial dimensions showed some (although limited) influence. Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage.","output":"Performance of an N95 Filtering Facepiece Particulate Respirator and a Surgical Mask During Human Breathing: Two Pathways for Particle Penetration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with excess mortality worldwide.

As a comparator group, we have chosen two fields that are not related to emerging infections and infectious diseases: and considered not directly affected by the pandemic: breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and included studies within the aforementioned study period as well as those registered in the preceding year (pre-study period: January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019). Gender of the investigator was predicted using the genderize.io API (application programming interface).

RESULTS: Only 27.8% (430/1548) of principal investigators (PIs) among COVID-19-related studies were women, which is significantly different compared to 54.9% (156/284) and 42.1% (56/133) for breast cancer (p<0.005) and T2DM (p<0.005) trials over the same period, respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate which factors are related to weight regain in the long-term after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). METHODS A retrospective case-control study with 40 patients undergoing SG (32 women, 8 men; age 42.9  10.7 y; preoperative body mass index 35  2.8 kg/m(2)), was performed. Patients were grouped according percentile->50% (cases) or <50% (controls)-of weight regain (%WR cutoff: 25% of weight loss). Weight history, anthropometry, glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), thyroid-stimulating hormone, resting energy expenditure, body composition, dietary survey, psychological test, and physical activity were recorded. Residual gastric capacity was estimated using a radiologic method. RESULTS (MEDIAN [P25-P75]): The evaluation was conducted 38.5 mo (34-41 mo) after SG. Percent weight regain ranged from 2.7% to 129.2% (25.4% [13-37.1]). Patients in the higher %WR group had a greater residual gastric volume (252.7  108.4 versus 148.5  25.3; P < 0.05) and the estimated volume was significantly correlated with %WR (r = 0.673; P = 0.023).

A higher fat intake and a trend toward higher total energy intake were observed in the group with greater %WR. Clinical or borderline levels of anxiety were more frequently observed in the higher %WR group (70% versus 30%; P = 0.01).

It is therefore paramount to identify therapeutic strategies that inhibit the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant. Here we report using 3D structural modelling that Spike of Omicron can still associate with human ACE2. Sera collected after the second mRNA-vaccination did not exhibit a protective effect against Omicron while strongly neutralizing infection of VeroE6 cells with the reference Wuhan strain, confirming recent data by other groups on limited vaccine and convalescent sera neutralization efficacy against Omicron. Importantly, clinical grade recombinant human soluble ACE2, a drug candidate currently in clinical development, potently neutralized Omicron infection of VeroE6 cells with markedly enhanced potency when compared to reference SARS-CoV-2 isolates. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron can be readily inhibited by soluble ACE2, providing proof of principle of a viable and effective therapeutic approach against Omicron infections.","output":"Clinical grade ACE2 effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on key safety metrics after transfusion of convalescent plasma in hospitalized coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients, having previously demonstrated safety in 5000 hospitalized patients.

RESULTS: The incidence of all serious adverse events was low; these included transfusion reactions (n=78; <1%), thromboembolic or thrombotic events (n=113; <1%), and cardiac events (n=677, ~3%). Notably, the vast majority of the thromboembolic or thrombotic events (n=75) and cardiac events (n=597) were judged to be unrelated to the plasma transfusion per se. The 7-day mortality rate was 13.0% (12.5%, 13.4%), and was higher among more critically ill patients relative to less ill counterparts, including patients admitted to the intensive care unit versus those not admitted (15.6 vs 9.3%), mechanically ventilated versus not ventilated (18.3% vs 9.9%), and with septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction/failure versus those without dysfunction/failure (21.7% vs 11.5%).

Imposed restrictions and treatment precautions may have also influenced OHCA processes-of-care. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on incidence, characteristics, and survival from OHCA in Victoria, Australia. METHODS: Using data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry, we compared 380 adult OHCA patients who received resuscitation between 16th March 2020 and 12th May 2020, with 1218 cases occurring during the same dates in 2017-2019. No OHCA patients were COVID-19 positive. Arrest incidence, characteristics and survival rates were compared. Regression analysis was performed to understand the independent effect of the pandemic period on survival. RESULTS: Incidence of OHCA did not differ during the pandemic period. However, initiation of resuscitation by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) significantly decreased (46.9% versus 40.6%, pa?=a?0.001). Arrests in public locations decreased in the pandemic period (20.8% versus 10.0%; pa?<a?0.001), as did initial shocks by public access defibrillation/first-responders (pa?=a?0.037). EMS caseload decreased during the pandemic period, however, delays to key interventions (time-to-first defibrillation, time-to-first epinephrine) significantly increased. Survival-to-discharge decreased by 50% during the pandemic period (11.7% versus 6.1%; pa?=a?0.002). Survivors per million person-years dropped in 2020, resulting in 35 excess deaths per million person-years. On adjusted analysis, the pandemic period remained associated with a 50% reduction in survival-to-discharge. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic period did not influence OHCA incidence but appears to have disrupted the system-of-care in Australia.

We demonstrate, both on model surfaces and on living cells, that the receptor binding domain (RBD) serves as the binding interface within the S-glycoprotein with the ACE2 receptor and extract the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of this binding pocket. Altogether, these results provide a picture of the established interaction on living cells. Finally, we test several binding inhibitor peptides targeting the virus early attachment stages, offering new perspectives in the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Molecular interaction and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel corona 2019 further named, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the outbreak has started from Wuhan city of china in December 2019 and within short spam, its spread in almost 200 countries, and hence world health organization declared it a pandemic emergency.

METHODS: To identify intermediate traits associated with the 3p21.31 locus, we first performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with 923 phenotypes in 310,999 European individuals from the UK Biobank. For genes potentially regulated by the COVID-19 risk variant, we examined associations between their expression and the polygenic score (PGS) of 1,263 complex traits in a meta-analysis of 31,684 blood samples. For the prioritized blood cell traits, we tested their associations with age and sex in the same UK Biobank sample. RESULTS: Our PheWAS highlighted multiple blood cell traits to be associated with the COVID-19 risk variant, including monocyte count and percentage (p = 1.0710 (-8), 4.0910 (-13)), eosinophil count and percentage (p = 5.7310 (-3), 2.2010 (-3)), and neutrophil percentage (p = 3.2310 (-3)). The PGS analysis revealed positive associations between the expression of candidate genes and genetically predicted counts of specific blood cells: CCR3 with eosinophil and basophil (p = 5.7310 (-21), 5.0810 (-19)); CCR2 with monocytes (p = 2.4010 (-10)); and CCR1 with monocytes and neutrophil (p = 1.7810 (-6), 7.1710 (-5)). Additionally, we found that almost all examined white blood cell traits are significantly different across age and sex groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that altered blood cell traits, especially those of monocyte, eosinophil, and neutrophil, may represent the mechanistic links between the genetic locus 3p21.31 and severe COVID-19.

We report our preliminary experience of stent-assisted coiling embolization of these aneurysms. METHODS A total of 50 patients with 52 tiny, wide-necked aneurysms who were treated with stent-assisted coiling from January 2007 to December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Baseline characteristics, procedure-related complications, angiographic follow-up results and clinical outcomes were statistically analyzed. RESULT All aneurysms were successfully treated with the stent-assisted coiling technique, and at the end of the procedure, aneurysm occlusion was complete for 45 (86.5 %), near complete for 3 (5.8 %) and incomplete for 4 (7.7 %). Procedural complications (1 intraprocedural rupture, 2 coil migrations and 1 aneurysm re-rupture) occurred in 4 (8 %) of 50 patients, resulting in permanent morbidity in 1 (2 %) patient and death in 1 (2 %) patient. Follow-up imaging was available in 43 (84.3 %) aneurysms for 6-31 months (mean, 13 months). Complete occlusion was achieved in 40 (93 %) of 43 aneurysms on long-term follow-up. One aneurysm with complete occlusion and one with incomplete occlusion after the initial embolization developed a significant recurrence (4.7 %). Clinical follow-up was available for 43 (86 %) of 50 patients at a mean of 36.7 months (range 15-66 months). Of these 43 patients, 42 (97 %) made an excellent recovery achieving a GOS of 5.

In the Middle East and Arab countries, the burden of RSV-associated hospitalizations is not well characterized. We sought to determine the burden and clinical/epidemiological characteristics of RSV hospitalization in young children in Amman, Jordan. We investigated risk factors for severity including vitamin D levels. METHODS: We conducted viral surveillance with clinical and demographic data in children <2 years admitted with respiratory symptoms and/or fever at the Al-Bashir Government Hospital from March16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and placed into lysis buffer, and frozen at ?80 C until testing by real-time RT-PCR for 11 respiratory viruses. Heel stick blood or sera samples for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were obtained and sent to a central laboratory for mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Of the 3168 children, >80% testing positive for one virus, with RSV the most common virus detected (44%). The RSV-associated hospitalization rate was highest in children <6 months with an annual range of 21.1C25.9 per 1000, compared to 6.0C8.0 in 6C11-month-olds and 1.6C2.5 in 12C23-month-olds. RSV-positive children compared with RSV-negative were more likely to be previously healthy without underlying medical conditions, less likely to be born prematurely, had a higher frequency of supplemental oxygen use, and had lower median vitamin D levels. Risk factors for oxygen use in RSV-positive children included underlying medical conditions, lack of breastfeeding, younger age, and higher viral load. CONCLUSION: RSV is a major cause of illness in hospitalized Jordanian children and is associated with increased severity compared to other respiratory viruses.

The role of viral infections during infancy is, however, less known, although early infancy is thought to be a crucial period for CF disease development.We prospectively assessed symptomatic and asymptomatic viral detection in the first year of life in infants with CF and healthy controls. METHODS In a prospective cohort study, we included 31 infants with CF from the Swiss Cystic Fibrosis Infant Lung Development Cohort and 32 unselected, healthy infants from the Basel Bern Infant Lung Development Cohort and followed them throughout the first year of life. Respiratory symptoms were assessed by weekly telephone interviews. Biweekly nasal swabs were analysed for 10 different viruses and two atypical bacteria with real-time seven duplex PCR (CF=561, controls=712). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Infants with CF and healthy controls showed similar numbers of swabs positive for virus (mean 42% vs 44%; OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26, p=0.6). Virus-positive swabs were less often accompanied by respiratory symptoms in infants with CF (17% vs 23%; OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.95, p=0.026). This finding was pronounced for symptomatic human rhinovirus detection (7% vs 11%; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.9, p=0.02).

To study the factors associated with tumor invasion, we established a new murine brain tumor model, ALTS1C1 derived from SV40 large T antigen-transfected astrocytes. This new brain tumor model recapitulates several histopathological features of human high-grade glioma including increased cellularity, prominent cellular pleomorphism, geographic necrosis, active mitosis, and extensive invasion of tumor cells into adjacent brain tissues. More importantly, ALTS1C1 expressed a relatively high level of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) in vitro and in vivo and higher microvascular density (MVD) in vivo. To define the roles of SDF-1 in this tumor model, the expression of SDF-1 in ALTS1C1 cells was inhibited by specific siRNA. SDF-knockdown ALTS1C1 (SDF(kd)) cells took longer than parental ALTS1C1 cells to form tumors and in contrast to the wild-type tumors they had well-defined regular borders and lacked infiltration tracts. The SDF(kd) tumors were also associated with a lower MVD and more hypoxic areas. In contrast to parental tumors, the density of F4/80-positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in SDF(kd) tumor was higher in non-hypoxic than in hypoxic regions. SDF-1 production by tumor cells therefore seems critical for the aggregation of TAMs into areas of hypoxia and tumor invasiveness. This study not only provides new insight into the role of SDF-1 in brain tumor invasion and the relationship between TAMs and hypoxia, but also provides a new preclinical brain tumor model for designing new treatment options for invasive cases.","output":"Tumor-secreted SDF-1 promotes glioma invasiveness and TAM tropism toward hypoxia in a murine astrocytoma model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Numerous reports of treatment of wide-neck aneurysms by flow diverters have been published; however, long-term outcomes remain uncertain. This article reports the imaging results of unruptured aneurysms treated electively with the Pipeline Embolization Device for up to 56 months and clinical results for up to 61 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred nineteen aneurysms in 98 patients from 3 centers admitted between August 2009 and June 2011 were followed at 6-month, 1-year, and 2+-year postprocedural timeframes. Analyses on the effects of incorporated vessels, previous stent placement, aneurysm size, and morphology on aneurysm occlusion were performed. RESULTS The 1- and 2+-year imaging follow-ups were performed, on average, 13 and 28 months postprocedure. At 2+-year follow-up, clinical data were 100% complete and imaging data were complete for 103/116 aneurysms (88.8%) with a 93.2% occlusion rate. From 0 to 6 months, TIA, minor stroke, and major stroke rates were 4.2%, 3.4%, and 0.8% respectively. After 6 months, 1 patient had a TIA of uncertain cause, with an overall Pipeline Embolization Device-related mortality rate of 0.8%. An incorporated vessel was significant for a delay in occlusion (P = .009) and nonocclusion at 6 months and 1 year, with a delayed mean time of occlusion from 9.1 months (95% CI, 7.1-11.1 months) to 16.7 months (95% CI, 11.4-22.0 months). Other factors were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS The Pipeline Embolization Device demonstrates continued very high closure rates at 2+ years, with few delayed clinical adverse sequelae.

Despite the advent of effective antiviral therapy, this treatment is not accessible to many patients and does not prevent reinfection, making chronic hepatitis C an ongoing global health problem. Thus, development of a prophylactic vaccine will represent a significant step toward global eradication of HCV. HCV exhibits high genetic variability, which leads frequently to immune escape. However, a considerable challenge faced in HCV vaccine development is designing an antigen that elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here, we characterized the immunogenicity of a vaccine based on a soluble, secreted form of the E1E2 envelope heterodimer (sE1E2.LZ). Sera from mice immunized with sE1E2.LZ exhibited an anti-E1E2Cspecific response comparable to mice immunized with membrane-bound E1E2 (mbE1E2) or a soluble E2 ectodomain (sE2). In competition-inhibition ELISA using antigenic domain-specific neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies, sera from sE1E2.LZ-immunized mice showed nearly identical or stronger competition toward neutralizing antibodies when compared with mbE1E2. In contrast, sera from mice immunized with sE2, and to a lesser extent mbE1E2, competed more effectively with nonneutralizing antibodies. An assessment of neutralization activity using both HCV pseudoparticles and cell cultureCderived infectious HCV showed that immunization with sE1E2.LZ elicited the broadest neutralization activity of the three antigens, and sE1E2.LZ induced neutralization activity against all genotypes.

We have designed a SNP identification pipeline to identify genetic variation using sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples. Our pipeline identifies a minimal marker panel that can define distinct genotypes. To evaluate the system we developed a genotyping panel to detect variants-identified from SARS-CoV-2 sequences surveyed between March and May 2020- and tested this on 50 stored qRT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples that had been collected across the South West of the UK in April 2020.

The patient received first oral budesonide, relapsed, but achieved remission under systemic steroids. METHODS: Imaging mass cytometry for spatial immune profiling was performed on liver biopsy tissue. Flow cytometry was performed to dissect CD8 T cell phenotypes and identify SARS-CoV-2-specific and EBV-specific T cells longitudinally. Vaccine-induced antibodies were determined by ELISA. Data was correlated with clinical labs. RESULTS: Analysis of the hepatic tissue revealed an immune infiltrate quantitatively dominated by activated cytotoxic CD8 T cells with panlobular distribution. An enrichment of CD4 T cells, B cells, plasma cells and myeloid cells was also observed compared to controls. The intrahepatic infiltrate showed enrichment for CD8 T cells with SARS-CoV-2-specificity compared to the peripheral blood. Notably, hepatitis severity correlated longitudinally with an activated cytotoxic phenotype of peripheral SARS-CoV-2-specific, but not EBV-specific CD8+ T cells or vaccine-induced immunoglobulins. CONCLUSIONS: COVID19 vaccination can elicit a distinct T cell-dominant immune-mediated hepatitis with a unique pathomechanism associated with vaccination induced antigen-specific tissue-resident immunity requiring systemic immunosuppression. LAY SUMMARY: Liver inflammation is observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection but can also occur in some individuals after vaccination and shares some typical features with autoimmune liver disease. In this report, we show that highly activated T cells accumulate and are evenly distributed in the different areas of the liver in a patient with liver inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Moreover, within these liver infiltrating T cells, we observed an enrichment of T cells that are reactive to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that these vaccine-induced cells can contribute to the liver inflammation in this context.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can elicit a CD8 T-cell dominant hepatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Most existing evidence about the prevalence of prenatal cannabis use relies on self-reported measures, which is limited by social desirability bias and recall bias. To date, several studies have examined the validity of self-reported measures of prenatal cannabis use, but this evidence has yet to be synthesized. To address this gap, we performed a scoping review to systematically identify and synthesize existing evidence on the validity of self-reported measures of cannabis use among pregnant women. METHODS We searched PubMed, PyschINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane/CENTRAL, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2010 and June 2021. We included studies that compared self-reported measures of cannabis use to a biochemical measure of cannabis (e.g., urine, hair, meconium) in pregnant women. We excluded studies reporting solely on prenatal cannabis use prevalence as well as those that examined self-reported drug use in which cannabis use was not a distinct category. RESULTS We found 12 unique studies (11 primary studies and one systematic review) that examined the validity of self-reported prenatal cannabis use, compared to a biochemical sample. Most studies were conducted in the US and conducted in either a hospital or clinical setting. We found that self-report was more valid in populations with a current or prior history of drug use. Self-report was also more valid when assessed via interviews by research team members than health care provider screenings or self-administered surveys. The most commonly used biochemical measure used was urine drug testing, which was found to have the highest level of concordance with self-report. CONCLUSIONS This scoping review systematically mapped existing evidence on the validity of self-reported prenatal cannabis use. Although much remains unknown in this area, an important next step is a systematic review that would provide robust evidence on clinical utilization of self-reported use in conjunction with biochemical samples. Further research is needed to examine validity by type of measure and mode of administration.

However, no phantom has been established for quality assurance for DIR. In order to develop a non-rigid phantom for accuracy control between CT and MRI images, we investigated the suitability of 3D printing materials and gel materials in this study. METHODS: We measured CT values, T1 values, T2 values, and the proton densities of 31 3D printer materials-purchased from three manufacturers-and one gel material. The dice coefficient after DIR was calculated for the CT-MRI images using a prototype phantom made of a gel material compatible with CT-MRI. RESULTS: The CT number of the 3D printing materials ranged from -6.8 to 146.4 HU. On MRI, T1 values were not measurable in most cases, whereas T2 values were not measurable in all cases; proton density (PD) ranged from 2.51% to 4.9%. The gel material had a CT number of 111.16 HU, T1 value of 813.65 ms, and T2 value of 27.19 ms. The prototype phantom was flexible, and the usefulness of DIR with CT and MRI images was demonstrated using this phantom.

Our transport device maintained three different cell lines (Caco2, A549, and HepG2 C3A) individually on transwell membranes with high viability (above 97%) for 48 h under simulated shipping conditions without an incubator. The device was also tested by actual overnight shipping of blood brain barrier constructs consisting of human induced pluripotent brain microvascular endothelial cells and rat astrocytes on transwell membranes to a remote facility (approximately 1200 miles away). The blood brain barrier constructs arrived with high cell viability and were able to regain full barrier integrity after equilibrating in the incubator for 24 h; this was assessed by the presence of continuous tight junction networks and in vivo-like values for trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER).

STUDY DESIGN This large, prospective, observational active surveillance study used a non-inferiority design. New users of NOMAC-E2 and COCLNG were recruited in 12 countries in Australia, Europe, and Latin America. Women were followed up directly and self-reported outcomes of interest were validated via treating physicians. The main outcome of interest was VTE, specifically deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Secondary outcomes included all VTE and ATE. Data on confounders were captured and independent blinded adjudication assessed the classification of events. Incidence rates, crude (HRcrude), and adjusted (HRadj) hazard ratios were calculated. RESULTS A total of 101,498 women (49,598 NOMAC-E2 users and 51,900 COCLNG users) were enrolled and followed for up to 2 years (144,901 WY of observation). NOMAC-E2 users had a higher mean age (31.0  8.63 years) than COCLNG users (29.3  8.53 years) but other baseline characteristics were similar between the cohorts. The main analysis comparing the risk of DVT of the lower extremities and PE in NOMAC-E2 users versus COCLNG users yielded an HRadj of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.25-1.35) (adjusted for age, BMI, family history of VTE, and current duration of use). The risk of all VTE and ATE was not higher in NOMAC-E2 users compared with COCLNG users. CONCLUSION(S) NOMAC-E2 use was not associated with a higher risk of VTE or ATE compared with COCLNG.","output":"Prospective controlled cohort study on the safety of a monophasic oral contraceptive containing nomegestrol acetate (2.5mg) and 17-oestradiol (1.5mg) (PRO-E2 study): risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social justice, inclusion and equity are everyone's responsibility.

Pregnant women naturally have a reduced immune system due to immunological changes and decreased lung capacity due to respiratory adaptations, making them more susceptible to coronavirus complications. Within the Mount Sinai Health system, more than 15,000 deliveries are performed annually. We began to care for pregnant women with known COVID-19 infections in late March of 2020. In early April 2020, a policy was implemented to perform universal COVID-19 testing for all women planning to deliver within the Mount Sinai Health system. We examined the antibody response of postpartum women who delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital with a SARS-CoV-2 infection between the study intervals during March 15, 2020, through April 30, 2020. STUDY DESIGN This was a prospective observational study examining the immune response of pregnant women who delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Women with a SARS-CoV-2 infection were contacted via phone to discuss participation in the study. Patients who consented were scheduled for a phlebotomy visit to assess their antibody titer levels to COVID-19. The COVID-19 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin (Ig)-G antibody test was used to evaluate the patients' antibody titers. The assay detects IgG antibodies for the detection of IgG seroconversion in patients following a known recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS A total of 120 patients were identified with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who delivered within the prespecified time frame. Of those patients, 25 women agreed to participate and were included. Of them, 64.00% were Caucasian with a mean age of 35 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m2 and the majority of patients had commercial insurance (88.00%). The majority of women were asymptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of admission (80.00%) and the average gestational age of delivery and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 39 weeks' gestation. The later the gestational age at the time of diagnosis, the lower the antibody titer response. When examining the interval from diagnosis to antibody titer analysis, patients with the highest titers (2,880) tended to have a shorter interval between their COVID-19 diagnosis and the time at which the titer level was drawn. Patients with symptoms on admission had similar antibody titer levels when compared with women who were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION The antibody response among women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy appears to be greater when the patients are diagnosed at an earlier gestational age.

This neurodegenerative disease disproportionately affects women. METHODS We use data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to examine sex differences in cortical thickness (CT) and memory performance. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to examine effects of sex and diagnosis (DX) on CT and verbal memory. For regions demonstrating significant interaction effects of sex and DX, we tested whether sex moderated cognition-thickness relationships. We used machine learning as a complementary method to explore multivariate CT differences between women and men. RESULTS Women demonstrated greater CT in many brain regions. More specifically, men showed relatively consistent CT declines in all stages, from normal control (NC) to ADD in the bilateral cingulate cortex, bilateral temporal regions, and left precuneus; women had more stable CT in these regions between NC and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages, but sharper declines from MCI to ADD. Similarly, for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), ANCOVA analyses showed that women had significantly better immediate and delayed recall scores than men, at NC and MCI stages, but greater differences, cross-sectionally, from MCI to ADD than men. We found significant sex moderation effects between RAVLT-immediate scores and CT of right isthmus-cingulate for all subjects across DX. Partial correlation analyses revealed that increased CT of right isthmus-cingulate was associated with better verbal learning in women, driven by positron emission tomography defined amyloid positive (A+) subjects. Significant sex-moderation effects in cognition-thickness relationships were further found in the right middle-temporal, left precuneus, and left superior temporal regions in A+ subjects. Using a machine learning approach, we investigated multivariate CT differences between women and men, showing an accuracy in classification of 75% for A+ cognitively NC participants. CONCLUSIONS Sex differences in memory and CT can play a key role in the different vulnerability and progression of ADD in women compared to men. Machine learning indicates sex differences in CT are most relevant early in the ADD neurodegeneration.","output":"Relationship of sex differences in cortical thickness and memory among cognitively healthy subjects and individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Routine childhood vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella has virtually abolished virus-related morbidity and mortality.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between the cardiac biomarkers and in-hospital mortality. ROC, AUC, and cutoff analyses were used to determine optimal cutoff values for the cardiac biomarkers. RESULTS: A total of 90 subjects with a complete panel of cardiac biomarkers out of the 224 rRT-PCR confirmed cases were included. The median age was 57 years (IQR, 47C67 years), majority were males. Sixty-six (77.6%) subjects survived while 19 (22.4%) expired. The most common presenting symptom was fever (75.6%), and the most common comorbidity was hypertension (67.8%). Spearman rho correlation analysis showed moderate positive association of high sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) with in-hospital mortality (R, 0.434, p = <0.001). Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that creatine kinase and hsTnI were independently associated with in-hospital mortality (OR, 4.103 [95% CI, 1.241C13.563], p=0.021; and OR, 7.899 [95% CI, 2.430C25.675], p=0.001, respectively). ROC curve analysis showed that hsTnI was a good predictor for in-hospital mortality (AUC, 0.829 [95% CI, 0.735C0.923], p = <0.001) and that creatine kinase was a poor predictor (AUC, 0.677 [95% CI, 0.531C0.823], p=0.018). Optimal cutoff point derived from the ROC curve for hsTnI was 0.010 ng/ml (J, 0.574) with a sensitivity of 84% (TPR, 0.842 [95% CI, 0.604C0.966]), specificity of 73% (TNR, 0.732 [95% CI, 0.614C0.386]), and an adjusted negative predictive value of 99% (Known prevalence*adjusted NPV, 0.989), a positive likelihood ratio of 20% (LR+, 3.147 [95% CI, 2.044C4.844]) and a negative likelihood ratio of 30% (LR?, 0.216 [95% CI, 0.076C0.615]).

We estimate the total excess COVID-19 cases and deaths associated with proximity to livestock plants to be 236,000 to 310,000 (6 to 8% of all US cases) and 4,300 to 5,200 (3 to 4% of all US deaths), respectively, as of July 21, 2020, with the vast majority likely related to community spread outside these plants.

The company may initiate phase II clinical trials in breast cancer and oesophageal cancer in 2006. Alfacell expanded a research agreement with the National Cancer Institute in September 2002, allowing the NCI to examine the effects of ranpirnase as a radiation enhancer. However, investigation in this use of ranpirnase now appears to be discontinued. Alfacell is conducting a confirmatory phase IIIb registration trial of ranpirnase plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone in more than 360 patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma, and will assess survival as the primary endpoint. The targeted treatment group in this trial represents 90% of malignant mesothelioma patients at the time of diagnosis. The trial is being conducted in the US, Canada, Poland, Italy, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Romania, Mexico and Brazil. In April 2006, a total of 210 events (patient deaths) was reached, representing two-thirds of the required events for the study. Results from the protocol-specified first interim analysis based on one-third of the required events have been reported and the company has the option to conduct a second interim analysis of the data at any point after 210 events. A final analysis will be undertaken at 316 events. Alfacell completed a phase III trial of single-agent ranpirnase in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma in April 1999. The efficacy of ranpirnase was compared with that of doxorubicin (head-to-head). The primary objectives were overall survival, progression-free survival and quality of life. In preclinical studies, ranpirnase demonstrated significant activity against neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and chemotherapy-resistant variants of these cancer cells. Development for these indications has been discontinued. Preclinical investigations conducted by Alfacell showed synergistic antitumour effects between ranpirnase and proteasome inhibitors. However, development is this area has been discontinued. Alfacell announced in May 2003 that it would be providing ranpirnase to the federal severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) testing programme for evaluation against the human coronavirus implicated in the disease.

The dominant route of cell entry of the coronavirus is via phagocytosis, with ensconcement in endosomes thereafter proceeding via the endosomal pathway, involving transfer from early (EEs) to late endosomes (LEs) and ultimately into lysosomes via endolysosomal fusion. EE to LE transportation is a rate-limiting step for coronaviruses. Hence inhibition or dysregulation of endosomal trafficking could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the acidic luminal pH of the endolysosomal system is critical for the activity of numerous pH-sensitive hydrolytic enzymes. Golgi sub-compartments and Golgi-derived secretory vesicles also depend on being mildly acidic for optimal function and structure. Activation of endosomal toll-like receptors by viral RNA can upregulate inflammatory mediators and contribute to a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm, associated with a worsened clinical outcome in COVID-19. Such endosomal toll-like receptors could be inhibited by the use of pharmacological agents which increase endosomal pH, thereby reducing the activity of acid-dependent endosomal proteases required for their activity and/or assembly, leading to suppression of antigen-presenting cell activity, decreased autoantibody secretion, decreased nuclear factor-kappa B activity and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. It is also noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy, predisposing infected cells to apoptosis. It is therefore also suggested that further pharmacological inhibition of autophagy might encourage the apoptotic clearance of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.","output":"Can endolysosomal deacidification and inhibition of autophagy prevent severe COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A better understanding of the transcriptomic modifications that occur in spina bifida may lead to identify mechanisms involved in the progression of spina bifida in utero and the development of new therapeutic strategies that aid in spinal cord regeneration after surgical interventions.

Here, we report serial changes in six circulating, cross-species/bridging biomarkers in a clinically relevant porcine model of neonatal HIE with functional analysis.

Changes in miR-374a, miR-181b and miR-181a appeared specific to moderate-severe HI. Histopathological injury and five miRNAs displayed positive correlations and were predictive of MRS Lac/Cr ratios. Bioinformatic analysis identified that components of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) family may be targets of miR-181a. Inhibition of miR-181a increased neurite length in both SH-SY5Y cells at 1 DIV (days in vitro) and in primary cultures of rat neuronal midbrain at 3 DIV. In agreement, inhibition of miR-181a increased expression of BMPR2 in differentiating SH-SY5Y cells.

There is conflicting evidence about the impact of statins use on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Purpose: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of statins use on mortality in these patients. Methods: We searched electronic databases from inception to March 3, 2021 for cohort studies evaluating the association between chronic and/or inpatient use of statins and mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We pooled unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using random-effects models. Results: A total of 25 cohort studies involving 147824 patients were included. The mean age ranged from 44.9 to 70.9 years and 57% of patients were men. The use of statins was not associated with mortality according to the unadjusted risk ratio (uRR, 1.16;95% CI, 0.86-1.57, 19 studies). In contrast, meta-analyses of adjusted odds ratio (aOR, 0.67;95% CI, 0.52- 0.86, 11 studies) and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR, 0.73;95% CI, 0.58-0.91, 10 studies) showed that the use of statins was independently associated with a significant reduction of mortality. Adjusted confounders included age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities in most of cohorts.

The object of this study is to understand the spatially varying associations between socioeconomic disadvantages and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Mexico at the ZIP code level. METHODS: We constructed ZIP code-level data (n=372) using the 2014-2018 American Community Survey and COVID-19 data from the New Mexico Department of Health (as of 24 May 2020). The log-linear Poisson and geographically weighted Poisson regression are applied to model the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (total population as the offset) in a ZIP code. RESULTS: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a ZIP code is positively associated with socioeconomic disadvantages-specifically, the high levels of concentrated disadvantage and income inequality. It is also positively associated with the percentage of American Indian and Alaskan Native populations, net of other potential confounders at the ZIP code level. Importantly, these associations are spatially varying in that some ZIP codes suffer more from concentrated disadvantage than others. CONCLUSIONS: Additional attention for COVID-19 mitigation effort should focus on areas with higher levels of concentrated disadvantage, income inequality, and higher percentage of American Indian and Alaska Native populations as these areas have higher incidence of COVID-19. The findings also highlight the importance of plumbing in all households for access to clean and safe water, and the dissemination of educational materials aimed at COVID-19 prevention in non-English language including Indigenous languages.","output":"Indigenous Peoples, concentrated disadvantage, and income inequality in New Mexico: a ZIP code-level investigation of spatially varying associations between socioeconomic disadvantages and confirmed COVID-19 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on the mental health and wellbeing of frontline health and social care workers. The need to support frontline staff has been recognised. However, there is to date little research specifically on how best to support the mental health needs of frontline workers, and none on their own experiences and views about what might be most helpful. Aims. We set out to redress this research gap by qualitatively exploring UK frontline health and social care workers own experiences and views of psychosocial support during the pandemic. Method. Frontline health and social care workers were recruited purposively through social media and by snowball sampling via healthcare colleagues. Workers who volunteered to take part in the study were interviewed remotely following a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed by the research team following the principles of Reflexive Thematic Analysis. Results. We conducted 25 interviews with frontline workers from a variety of professional groups working in health and social care settings across the UK. Themes derived from our analysis showed that workers experiences and views about psychosocial support were complex. Peer support was many workers first line of support but could also be experienced as a burden. Workers were ambivalent about support shown by organisations, media and the public. Whilst workers valued psychological support services, there were many disparities in provision and barriers to access. Conclusions. The results of this study show that frontline health and social care workers are likely to need a flexible system of support including peer, organisational and professional support. More research is needed to fully unpack the structural, systemic and individual barriers to accessing psychosocial support. Greater collaboration, consultation and co-production of support services and their evaluation is warranted.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of US public health practitioners, leaders, and academics expected to be knowledgeable about the report recommendations, public health practice, and changes in public health finance since the report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative feedback about changes to public health finance since the report. RESULTS: Thirty-two interviews were conducted between April and May 2019. The greatest momentum toward the report recommendations has occurred predominantly at the state and local levels, with recommendations requiring federal action making less progress. In addition, much of the progress identified is consensus building and preparation for change rather than clear changes. Overall, progress toward the recommendations has been slow. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the achievements reported by respondents were characterized as increased dialogue and individual state or local progress rather than widespread, identifiable policy or practice changes. Participants suggested that public health as a field needs to achieve further consensus and a uniform voice in order to advocate for changes at a federal level. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE: Slow progress in achieving 2012 IOM Finance Report recommendations and lack of a cohesive voice pose threats to the public's health, as can be seen in the context of COVID-19 emergency response activities.

METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we presented 20 KTR with COVID-19 pnemonia and examined the factors predicting the severity of COVID-19. A total of 10 KTR without COVID-19 was used as control group. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry. In 13/20 patients, immunophenotyping was repeated 1 week later. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 50  9 years. Patients were classified as mildCmoderate (oxygen saturation: SO(2) > 90%) and severe disease groups (SO(2)  90%). Serum albumin and hemoglobin were lower and CRP, fibrinogen and peak d-dimer were higher in severe group. Peak CRP was inversely associated with nadir SO(2) (r = ? 0.68, p = 0.001).

Although implemented in over 50 jurisdictions worldwide, this intervention remains vastly underutilised, and in Australia political commitment for such a tax is low. The aim of this study is to understand the politics of SSB taxation in Australia, what factors have constrained political commitment for a tax, and what might enable such commitment in future. METHODS We adopted a case study design, guided by a theoretical framework developed from the political economy of nutrition literature. Data were collected from 16 interviews with informants from multiple sectors, supported by media articles, journal articles, and grey literature. Data were coded and organized by thematic analysis, and synthesised into the final results. RESULTS Nutrition actors have made significant progress in generating commitment for a SSB tax by producing relevant evidence, raising awareness, advocating for action, employing resonating frames, collaborating with civil society organisations, and forming coalitions increasing their overall cohesion. Nevertheless, political commitment for a SSB tax is low and was found to be impeded by the powerful influence of the food, beverage, and sugar industries, opposition from both major Australian political parties, ideological resistance to regulation, a low quality monitoring and surveillance system for food and nutrition, and limited public advocacy. The influence of nutrition actors was also impeded by weak connections to key policy-makers and missed collaborative opportunities with pro-SSB tax organisations. CONCLUSION The identification of several impediments provides an explanation for why political commitment for a SSB tax is low in Australia and reveals several opportunities for how it might be generated in the future. Political commitment may come about through, for example, actions to limit the influence of industry in policy decision-making, and by strengthening the existing pro-SSB tax coalition.","output":"Generating Political Commitment for Regulatory Interventions Targeting Dietary Harms and Poor Nutrition: A Case Study on Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxation in Australia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CoVID-19 is a novel viral infection with now well-established clinical radiological findings.

In an 11-week period, 39 deceased persons were referred for medicolegal investigation with pre-existing or subsequent nasopharyngeal swabs showing positivity on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. All 39 had routine whole-body CT scans on admission and 12 underwent medicolegal autopsy. These cases were contrasted with 4 others which were negative on nasopharyngeal swabs despite PMCT findings suggestive of CoVID-19 pneumonia (designated false positive). Nine of the 12 autopsies showed lung histology consistent with those reported in CoVID-19 pneumonia. Typical clinical CoVID-19 lung findings on PMCT were only detected in 5 (42%). In 3 of the 4 false positive cases, lung findings showed non-COVID-19 histology but in 1, findings were identical. PMCT CoVID-19 findings in the lungs are therefore not specific and may not be detected in all cases due to obscuration by expected agonal CT findings or other pathologies that pre-dated SARS-CoV-2 infection. PMCT findings may otherwise be subtle. Although PMCT may hint at CoVID-19, we believe that nasopharyngeal swabs are still required for definitive diagnosis. Even with positive swabs, clinical CoVID-19 lung findings on PMCT are often not detected. PMCT findings can be subtle, extreme or obscured by agonal changes. Given this range of PMCT changes, the challenge for pathologists is to determine whether death has been caused by, or merely associated with, SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Post-mortem CT lung findings at a medicolegal institute in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases with autopsy correlation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years cryptosporidia have often been identified in diarrheic calves of under one month old, either as the sole pathogenic agent or in combination with other diarrhea-causing infectious agents.

This study aimed to measure pandemic-related effects on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among school-going girls in Kenya. METHODS: We report longitudinal findings of 910 girls in their last 2 years of secondary school. The study took place in 12 secondary day schools in rural western Kenya between 2018 and 2021. Using a causal-comparative design, we compared SRH and schooling outcomes among 403 girls who graduated after completion of their final school examinations in November 2019 pre-pandemic with 507 girls who experienced disrupted schooling due to COVID-19 and sat examinations in March 2021. Unadjusted and adjusted generalised linear mixed models were used to investigate the effect of COVID-19-related school closures and restrictions on all outcomes of interest and on incident pregnancy. RESULTS: At study initiation, the mean age of participants was 17.2 (IQR: 16.4C17.9) for girls in the pre-COVID-19 cohort and 17.5 (IQR: 16.5C18.4) for girls in the COVID-19 cohort. Girls experiencing COVID-19 containment measures had twice the risk of falling pregnant prior to completing secondary school after adjustment for age, household wealth and orphanhood status (adjusted risk ratio (aRR)=2.11; 95% CI:1.13 to 3.95, p=0.019); three times the risk of school dropout (aRR=3.03; 95% CI: 1.55 to 5.95, p=0.001) and 3.4 times the risk of school transfer prior to examinations (aRR=3.39; 95% CI: 1.70 to 6.77, p=0.001) relative to pre-COVID-19 learners. Girls in the COVID-19 cohort were more likely to be sexually active (aRR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.51, p=0.002) and less likely to report their first sex as desired (aRR=0.49; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.65, p<0.001).

Several machine learning techniques such as k-NN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree were used to predict whether local and foreign visitors arrival was high, medium, or low to these totally protected areas in Sarawak, Malaysia. The data of local and foreign visitors arrival to eighteen totally protected areas covering national parks, nature reserves, and wildlife centers in Sarawak, Malaysia, from 2015 to 2019 were used in this study. Variables such as the age of the park, distance from the nearest city, types of the park, recreation services availability, natural characteristics availability, and types of connectivity were used in the model. Based on the accuracy measure, precision, and recall, results show Decision Tree (Gain Ratio) exhibited the best prediction performance for both local visitors (accuracy = 80.65) and foreign visitors (accuracy = 84.35%). Distance to the nearest city and size of the park were found to be the most important predictors in predicting the local tourist visitors park classification, while for foreign visitors, age, type of park, and the natural characteristics availability were the significant predictors in predicting the foreign tourist visitors parks classification.

Most of the recently launched financial inclusion initiatives in Egypt, especially those aligned with the 2030 sustainability strategy, have targeted marginalized and excluded individuals. Only a few have addressed the financial inclusion of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Accordingly, this paper aims to identify the main pillars of financial inclusion for SMEs. In keeping up with the mainstream literature, it introduces a number of financial inclusion determinants designed to attract SMEs. They include supply-side determinants such as access to financial services and marketing awareness campaigns, which act as tools to segment financial services and market their benefits to SMEs, and demand-side determinants, which involve the use of financial services. Finally, there is an assessment of the macroeconomic risks to investors and SMEs. The researchers methodology was based on first deriving a novel dataset from responses to a questionnaire addressing bankers who manage SME portfolios, second analyzing the dataset through descriptive and inferential statistics and third undertaking a twofold econometric estimation. The econometric estimations started with principal component analysis (PCA) and proceeded to a logistic regression to determine the significant variables pertinent to increasing the financial inclusion of SMEs. The PCA suggested three main pillars determining financial inclusion. They are integrated marketing tools, which increase SMEs awareness of and access to the most sophisticated banking services, usage of banking services, and assessment of the macroeconomic risks that would prevent SMEs from gaining access to financial services. As well, the interaction term between the variables derived from the three pillars accounts for a variability of 86.6% in the level of financial inclusion of Egypts SMEs.","output":"The pillars determining financial inclusion among SMEs in Egypt: service awareness, access and usage metrics and macroeconomic policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The number of abdominal procedures performed via a robotic-assisted approach is increasing as potential advantages of the modality are recognised.

METHODS: The initial cases performed using Versius(?) at a single centre in the UK were included in the study. Anonymised data were prospectively collected including patient demographics, operative details and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-three operations were performed, including left (n = 14) and right (n = 9)-sided colonic resections. Rectal mobilisation was performed in 13. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were male, with a malignant indication for surgery in 70% of cases. Overall mean age was 59.1  15.3 (range 23C89) years. Overall mean body mass index was 28.9  5.2 with a mean of 31.3  4.5 for left-sided resections. The median console operating time was 166 min (range 75C320 min).

Methodology: A total of 176 teaching units of 45 minutes each were conducted digitally from May to August 2020. During the teaching units, medical students conducted interviews with SPs portraying various patients. The online conference software \\"HeiConf\\" was used for this purpose. During the teaching units, a total of 354 students were able to practice conversation techniques such as NURSE and SPIKES. After the teaching units, feedback was provided by students and SPs. Results: The digital lessons about medical conversation with SPs received positive feedback from SPs and students. The authenticity of the role portrayal of SPs seemed to be unaffected by the new format. Students were successful in training and observing conversation techniques. However, aspects of non-verbal communication, atmosphere and group dynamics as well as further discussions could not be carried out to the same extent as in the usual classroom teaching. Conclusion: The conversion of SP-based teaching to a digital format was successful in a short period of time and was able to prevent a cancellation of teaching units about medical conversation. Concrete conversation techniques could be tried out digitally by students. Due to the deficits of digital teaching in terms of non-verbal communication and atmosphere, a blended-learning format is planned for the future. In the first instance, concrete conversation techniques will be learned online in order to focus more on profound aspects of communication and discussions in a later physical teaching unit with SPs, thus enabling a learning experience that is as authentic as possible.","output":"Authentic SP-based teaching in spite of COVID-19 - is that possible?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Baiku Yao is a branch of the Yao nationality in China. The unique dying process of traditional clothing employed by these people has distinct national characteristics, a profound impact on the production and life of local people, and important research value. For this reason, it is important to investigate and document the dyeing plants and the traditional knowledge involved in the dyeing of Baku Yao traditional clothing. METHODOLOGY: Information on dyeing plants was obtained using the free-list method and interviews with 61 Baiku Yao informants in Guangxi and Guizhou from January 2020 to August 2021. Based on the free-list method, we evaluated and screened out important plants by calculating the cognitive salience value of each plant. RESULTS: The results showed that the people of Baiku Yao have accumulated rich traditional knowledge of dyeing plants and long-term dyeing and other processes. We collected 23 species and recorded the related traditional knowledge, such as the Baiku Yao name, life form, habitat, part(s) used, application type, usage, and area used. The utilization of dyeing plants has a strong relationship with ethnic culture. The Baiku Yao uses unique anti-dyeing material (Ailanthus vilmoriniana) in the cotton dyeing process, they call it the mother tree. As well as, the results also showed that 15 plants (65.2%) have medicinal value and can be used to treat 18 aliments, and wild plants play a very important role in the life of the Baiku Yao. CONCLUSION: These plants not only meet the color needs of the Baiku Yao people but also have health care effects, aligning with the trends toward green dyeing and the health contentiousness of modern people. This study provides a reference for the inheritance and development of Baiku Yao traditional clothing dyeing culture, will aid the identification of new natural, safe and healthy textile dyes, and is of positive significance in promoting regional economic development, national cultural inheritance, and biodiversity protection.","output":"Ethnobotanical study on plants used to dye traditional costumes by the Baiku Yao nationality of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The promise of precision medicine is based on the use of new technologies to better characterize patients by defining individuals in the areas of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and other aspects of biologic variability.

BACKGROUND: Reports from countries affected by the COVID 19 pandemic demonstrate a reduction in ACS hospitalizations and invasive procedures. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on ACS patient hospitalizations and related invasive procedures in a country with low COVID 19 incidence and without changes in Cardiology hospital services. METHODS: We conducted a retrograde study collecting data for ACS hospitalizations including ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non- ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA) and related invasive and revascularization procedures from March 9th 2020 (first COVID 19 case in our country) to April 30th (period of total lockdown) compared with the same period of 2019 in our center. RESULTS: Hospital admissions for ACS declined during 2020 (COVID 19 period) from a total of 550 patients in 2019 to 321 patients hospitalization in 2020 representing a 41.6% reduction (p < 0.001). The reduction was observed for all types of ACS, the greatest reduction was for UA 58% (p < 0.001) followed by NSTEMI 32% (p < 0.001) and for STEMI 28% reduction (p < 0.009). Compared to 2019 the proportion of patients presented with STEMI was higher in 2020 (48.6% vs 39.5% p = 0.01) and lower with UA (43.3% vs 31.5% p = 0.0002) Reduction was observed also in coronary angiography by 43% (p < 0.001) and in percutaneous coronary interventions with 42% (p < 0.001).

Social mission is the contribution of a school in its mission, programs, and the performance of its graduates, faculty, and leadership to advancing health equity and addressing the health disparities of the society in which it exists. This study examined the scope of social mission content in major U.S. and Canadian health professions education accreditation standards. METHOD The authors analyzed publicly available accreditation standards documents from 9 accreditors across 5 disciplines-dental, medical, nursing, pharmacy, and physician assistant schools-with effective years from 2016 to 2020. They created a codebook from the previously published social mission metrics survey, which includes 18 social mission activity areas and 79 indicators within those areas. The authors then conducted detailed document reviews to identify the presence of the social mission areas and indicators within the accreditation standards. RESULTS Across all 18 activity areas and 9 accreditors, the authors identified 93 instances of social mission. Curriculum was the most well represented area with 34 instances. Interprofessional education in curriculum was the most prevalent indicator with 17 instances. The Committee on Accreditation of Canadian Medical Schools included more social mission areas and indicators than the other accreditors. CONCLUSIONS There is substantial variability in the social mission content in accreditation standards across accreditors and disciplines. The authors found little representation of key aspects of social mission, including community collaborations, faculty training, and pipeline programs. These findings highlight areas of potential interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance the social mission content of health professions education.","output":"The Scope of Social Mission Content in Health Professions Education Accreditation Standards."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Twenty-four field isolates of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were isolated and examined for antigenic and biological characteristics. Most TGEV isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) in swine testis (ST) cell culture, which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected cells from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident. Minor variations in CPE were observed with one isolate, IA-145. Protein profiles of the TGEV isolates as determined by SDS-PAGE were essentially identical, with the exception of the isolate IA-101. The TGEV isolate IA-101 presented a higher molecular mass M protein and lacked an N protein doublet that was present in all other TGEV isolates. The TGEV isolates were shown to be closely related antigenically by using hyperimmune sera in a virus neutralization (VN) test. Some antigenic diversity was detected by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a VN test. Titers of the mAbs were highest with the homologous Miller TGEV, and one virus isolate, IA-156, was very poorly neutralized with the mAbs used in this study. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results were similar to those obtained by the VN test.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 who had been discharged or expired were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into corticosteroid group and non-corticosteroid group according to the systemic corticosteroid use or not. Clinical data were collected, and hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, time of viral clearance, time of mechanical ventilation, and duration from illness onset to symptom resolution were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 72 inpatients who were diagnosed with severe and critical COVID-19 were enrolled, in which 47 patients were divided into corticosteroid group and 25 were involved as the non-corticosteroid group. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the two groups. Four (5.6%) patients died during hospitalization, and 68 (94.4%) were discharged. Among survivors, the mean duration time from admission to discharge was 19.5d (SD 7.05 d). The mean time of viral clearance among survivors was 17.5d (SD 7.67 d), with a maximum of 37 d, and a minimum of 5 d. Hospital mortality (4.3% vs. 8.0%), length of hospital stay (18.7d vs. 21.0d), and time of viral clearance (16.1d vs. 19.4d) had no significant difference between two groups (p>0.05). The duration of symptoms suffering was shorter in the corticosteroid group than non-corticosteroid group, with statistically significant difference (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 cannot reduce the hospital mortality, and is not associated with delayed viral clearance, but it could relieve the inflammatory storm and improve clinical symptoms in brief.

Long-term (years) exposure to PM is known to affect human health by increasing susceptibility to viral infections as well as to the development of respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. In the short-term (days to months), PM has been suggested to assist airborne viral transmission. However, confounding factors such as urban mobility prevent causal conclusions. In this study, we explore short-term relationships between PM concentrations and the evolution of COVID-19 cases in a number of cities in the United States of America. We focus on the role of PM in facilitating viral transmission in early stages of the pandemic. We analyzed PM concentrations in two particle size ranges, <2.5 m, and between 10 and 2.5 m (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Granger causality analysis was employed to evaluate instantaneous and lagged effects of pollution in peaks of COVID-19 new daily cases in each location. The effect of pollution in shaping the disease spread was evaluated by correlating the logistic growth rate of accumulated cases with pollutants concentrations for a range of time lags and accumulation windows. PM2.5 shows the most significant results in Granger causality tests in comparison with the other pollutants. We found a strong and significant association between PM2.5 concentrations and the growth rate of accumulated cases between the 1st and 18th days after the report of the infection, peaking at the 8th day. By comparing results of PM2.5 with PM10, CO and NO2 we rule out confounding effects associated with mobility. We conclude that PM2.5 is not a first order effect in the cities considered; however, it plays a significant role in facilitating the COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Exploring the short-term role of particulate matter in the COVID-19 outbreak in USA cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge to the healthcare systems worldwide. This uncharted territory has changed the practices in modern healthcare delivery; this is particularly true in the case of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) where various changes are being adopted. This survey was conducted to determine the impact of the pandemic and the changes being adopted in the field of MIS, from a resource-limited developing country, India. Materials and Methods: The survey was carried out from 27 July to 22 August 2020, amongst MIS surgeons in India using an online questionnaire generated on Google Forms. Results: The survey was completed by 251 MIS surgeons nationwide. There was a proportional reduction of overall elective surgeries and MIS. Approximately 30% of the surgeons continued to use MIS, as during the pre-pandemic era. Pre-operative tests for COVID-19 (96.1%) and personal protective equipment (PPE, 66%-86%), including respirators (95.2%), are used uniformly across the nation. Almost half (43.1%) of the MIS surgeons are using &#8805;6 recommended intraoperative modifications in MIS to mitigate the COVID-19 transmission.

We aim to evaluate the robotic transabdominal preperitoneal ventral hernia repair (rTAPP-VHR) learning curve based on operative times while accounting for peritoneal flap integrity. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a database collected over a 7-year period. Patients with primary ventral hernias were included and a cumulative sum analysis(CUSUM) was used to create learning curves for three subsets of operative times. A risk-adjusted CUSUM (RA-CUSUM) accounted for repair quality based on peritoneal flap completeness. The flap was considered as incomplete when peritoneal gaps were unable to be closed. RESULTS: 105 patients undergoing rTAPP-VHR were included. Learning curves were created for skin-to-skin, console, and off-console times. Patients were divided into three phases. In terms of skin-to-skin times, both phase 2&3 had a mean 11 min shorter than that of phase 1 (p = 0.0498, p = 0.0245, respectively), with a steady decrease after forty-six cases. An incomplete peritoneal flap was noted in 25/36 patients in phase 1, as compared to 5/24 and 5/45 patients in phase 2&3, respectively. When risk-adjusted for peritoneal flap completeness, gradually decreasing skin-to-skin times were observed after sixty-one cases. In terms of off-console times, the mean across three phases was 14 min, with marked improvement after forty-three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Forty-six cases were needed to achieve steadily decreasing operative times. We can assume that ensuring good-quality repairs, through maintenance of peritoneal flap integrity, was gradually improved after sixty-one cases.

It was pointed out that an early intervention applying management techniques used in patients with CFS/ME appeared to help reduce the fatigue related symptoms of Long COVID. Here we present an analysis of a consecutive case series of the first twenty patients data collected. Our aim was to evaluate the potential of this mode of treatment for Long COVID. Method Face to face treatment sessions with the practitioners occurred once a week, involving effleurage and other manual articulatory techniques. The individuals being treated also undertook a daily self-massage along with gentle mobility exercises and alternating warm and cool gel packs on the upper spine, to encourage a reduction of spinal inflammation and further aid lymph drainage of the brain and spine. Symptom severity was recorded using the self-reported 54-item Profile of Fatigue Related States (PFRS). Result The mean age of the men was 41.8 years with a range of 29.1-53.1 years with the corresponding mean age for women being 39.3 years with a range of 28.3-50.4 years. The average time interval between onset of Coronavirus symptoms and start of treatment for Long COVID was just over 20 weeks. The average number of treatment sessions was similar at 9.7 in men and 9.4 in women. The change in Profile of Fatigue Related States (PFRS) score was similar in men with a significant decrease (-45%) as in women (-52%) (F 4.8, p < 0.001). None of the individuals had any prior diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. All were new attendees to the clinic at the time of initial assessment. Conclusion Our findings indicate that this intervention based on massage and mobility exercises significantly reduced fatigue related to Long COVID. It may be that early intervention and supportive treatments at the end of the acute phase of COVID-19 can help overcome acute phase symptoms and prevent them becoming chronic/enduring.","output":"Reducing fatigue-related symptoms in Long COVID-19: finding an intervention that works"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fourier analysis can provide policymakers useful information for analysing the pandemic behaviours.

Usually, coronavirus infection is characterized by dysregulated host immune responses, interleukine-6 increase, hyper-activation of cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes. Interestingly, Vitamin D deficiency has been often associated with altered immune responses and infections. In the present study, we evaluated Vitamin D plasma levels in patients affected with different lung involvement during COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Lymphocyte phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. Thoracic CT scan involvement was obtained by an image analysis program. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels were deficient in (80%) of patients, insufficient in (6.5%) and normal in (13.5%). Patients with very low Vitamin D plasma levels had more elevated D-Dimer values, a more elevated B lymphocyte cell count, a reduction of CD8 + T lymphocytes with a low CD4/CD8 ratio, more compromised clinical findings (measured by LIPI and SOFA scores) and thoracic CT scan involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with compromised inflammatory responses and higher pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 affected patients.

SUMMARY: In the spring of 2020, New York City quickly became a hotspot for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, putting a strain on local healthcare systems. Antimicrobial stewardship programs faced diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties as well as healthcare resource challenges. With the lack of effective antivirals, antibiotic use in critically ill patients was difficult to avoid. Uncertainty drove antimicrobial use and thus antimicrobial stewardship principles were paramount. The dramatic influx of patients, drug and equipment shortages, and the need for prescribers to practice in alternative roles only compounded the situation. Establishing enhanced communication, education, and inventory control while leveraging the capabilities of the electronic medical record were some of the tools used to optimize existing resources. CONCLUSION: New York City was a unique and challenging environment during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Antimicrobial stewardship programs can learn from each other by sharing lessons learned and practice opportunities to better prepare other programs facing COVID-19 case surges.","output":"Antimicrobial stewardship perspectives from a New York City hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic: Challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a digital surveillance model using Google Trends is feasible for obtaining accurate data on coronavirus disease 2019 and whether accurate predictions can be made regarding new cases.

RECENT FINDINGS: Forty-four studies are included in this review. Between 11 and 73.4% of HCWs, mainly including physicians, nurses, and auxiliary staff, reported post-traumatic stress symptoms during outbreaks, with symptoms lasting after 1-3 years in 10-40%. Depressive symptoms are reported in 27.5-50.7%, insomnia symptoms in 34-36.1%, and severe anxiety symptoms in 45%. General psychiatric symptoms during outbreaks have a range comprised between 17.3 and 75.3%; high levels of stress related to working are reported in 18.1 to 80.1%. Several individual and work-related features can be considered risk or protective factors, such as personality characteristics, the level of exposure to affected patients, and organizational support. Empirical evidence underlines the need to address the detrimental effects of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on HCWs' mental health. Recommendations should include the assessment and promotion of coping strategies and resilience, special attention to frontline HCWs, provision of adequate protective supplies, and organization of online support services.","output":"The Psychological Impact of Epidemic and Pandemic Outbreaks on Healthcare Workers: Rapid Review of the Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most of the existing recognition algorithms are proposed for closed set scenarios, where all categories are known beforehand. However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called\\"knowns\\", and there are more we do not know called\\"unknowns\\". Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to\\"open\\"the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speed up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.","output":"P-ODN: Prototype based Open Deep Network for Open Set Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A tracheostomy performed on patients infected with SARS CoV-2 is one of the procedures with the highest risks of aerosolization.

Nevertheless, the literature has described persistent problems with this acceptance ever since brain death was described. Many of these problems are not widely known or properly understood by much of the medical community. Here we aim to clarify these issues, based on the two intractable problems in the brain death debates. First, the metaphysical problem: there is no reason that withstands critical scrutiny to believe that BD is the state of biological death of the human organism. Second, the epistemic problem: there is no way currently to diagnose the state of BD, the irreversible loss of all brain functions, using clinical tests and ancillary tests, given potential confounders to testing. We discuss these problems and their main objections and conclude that these problems are intractable in that there has been no acceptable solution offered other than bare assertions of an operational definition of death. We present possible ways to move forward that accept both the metaphysical problem - that BD is not biological death of the human organism - and the epistemic problem - that as currently diagnosed, BD is a devastating neurological state where recovery of sentience is very unlikely, but not a confirmed state of irreversible loss of all [critical] brain functions. We argue that the best solution is to abandon the dead donor rule, thus allowing vital organ donation from patients currently diagnosed as BD, assuming appropriate changes are made to the consent process and to laws about killing.","output":"The intractable problems with brain death and possible solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to trigger a wide spectrum of immune responses and clinical manifestations in human hosts. Here, we sought to elucidate novel aspects of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection through RNA sequencing of peripheral blood samples from 46 subjects with COVID-19 and directly comparing them to subjects with seasonal coronavirus, influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy controls. Early SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a powerful transcriptomic response in peripheral blood with conserved components that are heavily interferon-driven but also marked by indicators of early B-cell activation and antibody production. Interferon responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrate unique patterns of dysregulated expression compared to other infectious and healthy states. Heterogeneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways are present in early COVID-19, as are IL1 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which persist into late disease. Classifiers based on differentially expressed genes accurately distinguished SARS-CoV-2 infection from other acute illnesses (auROC 0.95 [95% CI 0.92-0.98]).

The prevalence is 0.001%C0.025% populations. This condition often misdiagnosed because the symptom does not appear. Acute symptoms such as abdominal pain may occur due to the obstruction of retrograde menstrual flow. In this case, we presented a case complex management of vaginal atresia with pyosalpinx, hematometra and bilateral hematosalpinx. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 12 years old teenager, non-sexually active, complained cyclic abdominal pain that worsening in seven months before admission. Patient never had menstrual blood flow during her life. Patient was diagnosed with hematometra, hematocolpos, bilateral hematosalpinx and distal vaginal agenesis. Amnion graft neovagina was performed. Five days after surgery, patient started to have fever. On the seventh days after surgery, amnion graft was removed. The next two days patient still had fever. Because of continuous fever, patient was test of COVID 19. The result was positive. On the eleventh days after the first surgery, patient complained abdominal pain VAS 3C4. Patient was diagnosed with pyosalpinx by ultrasound examination. Laparotomy was done performing adhesiolysis, bilateral salpingectomy, and omentectomy. DISCUSSION: In our case vaginal reconstruction surgery from vaginal approach has been done without management of the bilateral hematosalpinx because the consideration of small caliber of bilateral hematosalpinx. But then complications were developed when vaginal canal was opened, bilateral hematosalpinx were transformed into bilateral pyosalpinx and continue to developed into bilateral tubal abscess. We assume during this process, the bacteria from vagina could fastly infecting the blood and transformed it into pus and grew until tubal abscess. CONCLUSION: The surgical intervention in vaginal agenesis must be considered as a treatment and not only focus on the reconstruction.

We compared the baseline characteristics, laboratory data, and clinical course between survivors and nonsurvivors to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in the patients with DKA. Results: A total number of 43 patients were included in this study. The median age was 52 years. Thirty-three (76.7%) patients were male. Median value of initial glucose on presentation was 553 mg/dL (300.0-1927.0 mg/dL). On admission, 33 (76.7%) patients had glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)  8% (64 mmol/mol) and HbA1c was not obtained in 10 (23.3%) patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was seen in 37 (86.0%) patients, 6 (14%) patients required renal replacement therapy and 22 (51.2%) required mechanical ventilation. Among the 43 patients, 25 (58.1%) died.

Women entrepreneurs have limited access to information, training, credit, and networks compared to that of men entrepreneurs. Business Associations (BAs) are self-governing bodies designed to meet the needs of entrepreneurs in a specific local, national and regional socio-economic-cultural context. This study investigates firstly the potential of BAs to support and empower women entrepreneurs and the difficulties encountered by women in taking up leadership positions in BAs. METHODS: Three sub-sectors from among tourism enterprises in Hikkaduwa Urban Council, Galle District, in Sri Lanka were studied. A questionnaire survey among 390 respondents (195 women, 195 men) was conducted aiming to understand the profile of entrepreneurs. Employing 24 in-depth interviews (12 women, 12 men), a further investigation was taken to ascertain the underlying reasons of their decisions in business and family. FINDINGS: Determined to overcome the challenges, women entrepreneurs join BAs thus gaining access to business resources such as financial, information and connections. They become members of multiple BAs seeking tenacities to address difficulties they face as women entrepreneurs. However, women's participation is restricted to low-level positions while significant leadership positions in BAs tend to be dominated by male thereby obstructing a great deal of potential benefits yieldable by women.

By buffering excess ROS, cerium oxide (CeO(2)) nanoparticles (NPs) (nanoceria) not only protect from oxidative stress consequence of inflammation but also modulate the immune response towards inflammation resolution. Immunomodulation is the modulation (regulatory adjustment) of the immune system. It has natural and human-induced forms, and it is part of immunotherapy, in which immune responses are induced, amplified, attenuated, or prevented according to therapeutic goals. For decades, it has been observed that immune cells transform from relative metabolic quiescence to a highly active metabolic state during activation(1). These changes in metabolism affect fate and function over a broad range of timescales and cell types, always correlated to metabolic changes closely associated with mitochondria number and morphology. The question is how to control the immunochemical potential, thereby regulating the immune response, by administering cellular power supply. In this regard, immune cells show different general catabolic modes relative to their activation status, linked to their specific functions (maintenance, scavenging, defense, resolution, and repair) that can be correlated to different ROS requirements and production. Properly formulated, nanoceria is highly soluble, safe, and potentially biodegradable, and it may overcome current antioxidant substances limitations and thus open a new era for human health management.","output":"How Does Immunomodulatory Nanoceria Work?

It is also seemingly a common psychological reaction to pandemic outbreaks with forced quarantines and lockdowns. Thus, depression represents, now more than ever, a major global health burden with therapeutic management challenges. Clinical data highlights that physical exercise is gaining momentum as a non-pharmacological intervention in depressive disorders. Although it may contribute to the reduction of systemic inflammation associated with depression, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial physical exercise effects in emotional behavior remain to be elucidated. Current investigations indicate that a rapid release of extracellular vesicles into the circulation might be the signaling mediators of systemic adaptations to physical exercise. These biological entities are now well-established intercellular communicators, playing a major role in relevant physiological and pathophysiological functions, including brain cell-cell communication. We also reviewed emerging evidence correlating depression with modified circulating extracellular vesicle surfaces and cargo signatures (e.g., microRNAs and proteins), envisioned as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, efficient disease stratification and appropriate therapeutic management. Accordingly, the clinical data summarized in the present review prompted us to hypothesize that physical exercise-related circulating extracellular vesicles contribute to its antidepressant effects, particularly through the modulation of inflammation.

Moreover, although physiological processes evidently interact with socio-demographic factors to modulate individuals' response to a crisis, it remains largely unknown how these complex interactions shape people's mental responses to COVID-19. To fill these gaps of knowledge, we chose a potent physiological marker of distress - heightened baseline electrodermal activity (EDA) measured before the pandemic began - and hypothesized it would be related to greater COVID-related fears and worries as a function of individuals' household size. METHOD 185 individuals (71% women), who had participated in our lab studies 2-3 years ago, in which we assessed their baseline EDA, completed several questionnaires online, including assessments of their current fears regarding COVID. Participants also reported the number of people in their household, with whom they had been together during a lockdown which was taking place at the time. We used pre-pandemic EDA measures in combination with their household size to predict participants' current fears. RESULTS Pre-pandemic EDA measures predicted current COVID-related fears and worries. Specifically for the EDA measure \\"number of skin conductance responses\\", we further found that the number of people in the household during the lockdown, moderated the abovementioned relationship, such that it occurred in individuals with average and larger households and not in those with small households.

Although MVs play a variety of roles in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis, the mechanisms underlying MV formation in Gram-positive microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus remain obscure. Bacterial MV production can be induced in response to stress conditions, and the alternative sigma factor B (SigB) functions as a central regulator of the stress response in Gram-positive bacteria. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the SigB(Q225P) substitution mutation in S. aureus promotes biofilm formation.

LacZ reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the Q225P substitution reduces SigB binding to the promoter region of the thermonuclease gene (nuc), resulting in a significant reduction in Nuc expression. Deletion of nuc markedly enhances S. aureus MV generation, possibly due to the accumulation of nucleic acids.

Although governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing various rules while interacting with relevant organizations to provide health service, vaccine research, and production of essential items, the complexities in the interactions between various stakeholders have proved to be challenging to have efficient and timely outputs. When different stakeholders (i.e. governments, organizations, and the public) are interacting with each other, a systems thinking process needs to be applied to capture the nuances of the interactions and the subsequent emergent behavior to effectively contribute to the system output (i.e. a safer way of life). This paper applied a system-thinking-inspired process called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to analyze the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis treated various stakeholders as a part of the system, and it focused on the interactions among different stakeholders (i.e. functional blocks) within the system - i.e. 'Government', 'Foreign Governments', 'Organizations', and 'General Public', as well as the interactions with 'W.H.O'. The STPA analysis found 236 potential Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) (or unsafe interactions) among the stakeholder interactions, each of the UCAs was then further analyzed.

METHODS: A cross-sectional design in which a web-based questionnaire was sent to professionals was used to collect answers from 174 participants, most of whom women and nurses. RESULTS: Perceived stigma was negatively related with compassion satisfaction and positively related with an increase in both burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Professional identification had a positive correlation with satisfaction and a negative correlation with burnout, but this was not directly related with secondary traumatic stress. Importantly, stigma and identification interacted so that stigma decreased compassion satisfaction only when identification was low, and increased secondary traumatic stress only when identification was high. No interaction effect appeared with respect to burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Experience of stigmatization has the potential to decrease the quality of professional life of healthcare professionals.

At the same time, stories abound whereby these essential employees are not provided adequate support and protection on their jobs. Nevertheless, they have been portrayed predominantly as heroes rather than as victims, which may inadvertently lead third parties (e.g., the general public) to overlook their suffering. The current research sought to understand the implications of these divergent social accounts of essential employees for third parties. We investigated the effects of third parties being provided with (Study 1) and endorsing (Study 2 and Study 3) heroism and victimization accounts on their cognitions, emotions, and behaviors toward essential employees. Unlike victimization which was associated with higher levels of third parties' injustice perceptions, anger and sympathy toward essential employees' situation, and their intent to take political action to support essential workers, we found that heroism was only significantly related to higher levels of sympathy and had limited effects on other outcomes. Further, victimization was a more important predictor of injustice and anger than heroism. Overall, the sharp contrast between the two accounts points to the caveats of overemphasizing heroism accounts in the COVID-19 pandemic as they may divert third parties' attention away from essential employees' suffering.

Uncertainty related to Parkinson's disease and to COVID-19 amplified each other, and cancelled clinical appointments and limitations on physical activity had very significant impacts on wellbeing for this group. In the longitudinal study, frailty was more severe during lockdown periods. While lockdowns reduce spread of the virus, becoming frailer could make older adults more vulnerable to the effects of the virus during these periods. Regular exercise during lockdown had beneficial effects aiding recovery once restrictions relaxed. These studies suggest factors that could lessen negative impacts of future lockdowns.

CONCLUSION: This is the first real-world cohort study reporting the results of a multimodal remote digital approach for chronic SP rehabilitation. High completion and engagement rates were observed, which were associated with clinically significant improvement in all health-related outcomes, as well as marked productivity recovery. These promising results support the potential of digital modalities to address the global burden of chronic musculoskeletal pain.","output":"Asynchronous and Tailored Digital Rehabilitation of Chronic Shoulder Pain: A Prospective Longitudinal Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, rapid diagnostics have been frequently sought to quickly evaluate a patients condition. Lung ultrasound can provide an early glimpse into the disease process and its severity. The addition of focused echocardiography can be particularly helpful in the haemodynamically compromised patient to detect myocardial involvement and alternative diagnoses. Case: We discuss here a 53-year-old patient who presented to the Emergency Department with hypoxia and hypotension. Bedside focused ultrasound revealed signs of COVID-19 pneumonia with evidence of right ventricular strain, initially thought to be due to massive pulmonary embolism. A computed tomography scan confirmed the findings on ultrasonography, but surprisingly did not demonstrate a pulmonary embolism. Conclusion: Point-of-care ultrasound in COVID-19 aided the diagnosis of affected organs and helped categorise the type of shock in this patient; however, right ventricular dysfunction should be interpreted with caution and may not be due to a pulmonary embolism, as in this case.","output":"Focused echocardiography in COVID-19: An unusual case of acute right ventricular dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT Although the use of topical vancomycin has been shown to be safe and effective for reducing postoperative infection rates in patients after spine surgery, its use in cranial wounds has not been studied systematically. The authors hypothesized that topical vancomycin, applied in powder form directly to the subgaleal space during closure, would reduce cranial wound infection rates. METHODS A cohort of 150 consecutive patients who underwent craniotomy was studied retrospectively. Seventy-five patients received 1 g of vancomycin powder applied in the subgaleal space at the time of closure. This group was compared with 75 matched-control patients who were accrued over the same time interval and did not receive vancomycin. The primary outcome measure was the presence of surgical site infection within 3 months. Secondary outcome measures included tissue pH from a subgaleal drain and vancomycin levels from the subgaleal space and serum. RESULTS Vancomycin was associated with significantly fewer surgical site infections (1 of 75) than was standard antibiotic prophylaxis alone (5 of 75; p < 0.05). Cultures were positive for typical skin flora species. As expected, local measured vancomycin concentrations peaked immediately after surgery (mean  SD 499  37 g/ml) and gradually decreased over 12 hours. Vancomycin in the circulating serum remained undetectable. Subgaleal topical vancomycin was associated with a lower incidence of surgical site infections after craniotomy. The authors attribute this reduction in the infection rate to local vancomycin concentrations well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for antimicrobial efficacy. CONCLUSIONS Topical vancomycin is safe and effective for reducing surgical site infections after craniotomy. These data support the need for a prospective randomized examination of topical vancomycin in the setting of cranial surgery.","output":"Reducing surgical site infections following craniotomy: examination of the use of topical vancomycin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Huge quantities of pollutants are released into the atmosphere of many cities every day. These emissions, due to physicochemical conditions, can interact with each other, resulting in additional pollutants such as ozone. The resulting accumulation of pollutants can be dangerous for human health. To date, urban pollution is recognized as one of the main environmental risk factors. This research aims to correlate, through soft computing techniques, namely Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Programming, the data of the tumours recorded by the Local Health Authority of the city of Benevento, in Italy, with those of the pollutants detected in the air monitoring stations. Such stations can monitor many pollutants, i.e. NO(2), CO, PM(10), PM(2.5), O(3) and Benzene (C(6)H(6)). Assuming possible effects on human health in the medium term, in this work we treat the data relating to pollutants from the 2012C2014 period while, the tumour data, provided by local hospitals, refer to the time interval 2016C2018. The results show a high correlation between the cases of lung tumours and the exceedance of atmospheric particulate matter and ozone.

Marine algae have abundant amounts and varieties of bioactive compounds that possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the photoprotective effects of an ethanol extract of Sargassum thunbergii. METHODS: Sargassum thunbergii phenolic-rich extract (STPE) was prepared, and its activity against UVB damage was evaluated using L929 fibroblast cells and zebrafish. STPE was extracted and purified by 40% ethanol and macroporous resin XDA-7. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were analyzed. The effect of STPE on UVB-induced inflammation was determined by inflammatory cytokine gene and protein expression. The expression of signaling molecules in the Nuclear Factor KappaB (NF-B) pathway was determined by western blotting. DNA condensation was analyzed and visualized by Hoechst 33342 staining. In vivo evaluation was performed by tail fin area and ROS measurement using the zebrafish model. RESULTS: The total polyphenol content of STPE was 72%. STPE reduced ROS content in L929 cells, improved SOD and CAT activities, and significantly reduced MDA content, thereby effectively alleviating UVB radiation-induced oxidative damage. STPE inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1. STPE reversed DNA condensation at concentrations of 20 and 40 g/mL compared with the UVB control. Moreover, STPE inhibited NF-B signaling pathway activation and alleviated DNA agglutination in L929 cells after UVB irradiation. Additionally, 1.67 g/mL STPE significantly increased the tail fin area in zebrafish, and 0.8C1.6 g/mL STPE effectively eliminated excessive ROS after UVB radiation. CONCLUSIONS: STPE inhibited UVB-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine expression, and DNA condensation via the downregulation of the NF-B signaling pathway, suggesting that it prevents UVB-induced photodamage, and has potential for clinical development for skin disease treatment.

This study aimed to explore perceptions and acceptance of bereaved families and health-care professionals regarding MITS in the context of MITS initiation in Rwanda as an alternative to clinical autopsy. METHODS: This was a qualitative phenomenological study with thematic analysis. Participants were bereaved relatives (individual interviews) and health-care professionals (focus-group discussions) involved in MITS implementation. It was conducted in the largest referral and teaching hospital in Rwanda. RESULTS: Motivators of MITS acceptance included eagerness to know the CoD, noninvasiveness of MITS, trust in medics, and the fact that it was free. Barriers to consent to MITS included inadequate explanations from health-care professionals, high socioeconomic status, lack of power to make decisions, and lack of trust in medics. Health-care professionals perceived both conventional autopsy and MITS as gold-standard procedures in CoD determination. They recommended including MITS among hospital services and commended the post-MITS multidisciplinary discussion panel in CoD determination. They pointed out that there might be reticence in approaching bereaved relatives to obtain consent for MITS. Both groups of participants highlighted the issue of delay in releasing MITS results. CONCLUSION: Both health-care professionals and bereaved relatives appreciate that MITS is an acceptable procedure to include in routine hospital services. Dealing with barriers met by either group is to be considered in the eventual next phases of MITS implementation in Rwanda and similar sociocultural contexts.","output":"Exploring Perceptions and Acceptance of Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling among Bereaved Relatives and Health-Care Professionals in Rwanda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reuse of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for specific diseases such as COVID-19 requires data to be recorded and persisted according to international standards.

In addition to working extended hours under increased duress, healthcare professionals (HCP) of all stations have been making use of various types of personal protective equipment (PPE) with greatly increased frequency and duration. Current data regarding adverse skin reactions as a possible consequence of PPE use are, particularly in the United States, largely insufficient for policy-makers to make informed decisions regarding daily PPE use among HCP. The research vehicle employed by this study is a cross-sectional 25-item survey distributed via email to workers currently employed by a five-hospital system in southcentral Kentucky. This survey was used to collect information from hospital workers of all professional roles about their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on reports of adverse dermatological reactions and associated risk factors. Out of 879 respondents, 54.4% reported some type of skin irritation reaction. Skin irritation was significantly more prevalent among medical and medical support staff than non-medical hospital workers, with the highest prevalence among Certified Nurse Assistant (CNAs). Among clinical workers, those in dedicated COVID-19 units reported the highest prevalence of adverse skin reaction. The most common complaint was dryness/scaling of the skin (306 out of 439, 69.7%), and the most common location was the facial cheeks (305 out of 516, 59.1%). Among those who reported skin irritation, the average self-reported severity of skin reaction (on a scale of 1C5) was 2.00  0.05, and the mean total days of skin reaction per month was 11.70  0.39 days. Total days of irritation per month was found to be significantly related to total days of PPE use per month, hours of PPE use per day, frequency of hand washing, and use of disinfecting UV irradiation. Severity of skin reaction was found to be significantly related to hours per day of PPE use, consecutive days of PPE use, and female sex. Clinical workers that put in the most face-to-face time with patients, and those in dedicated COVID-19 units, had the highest risk of adverse skin reaction. Overall, skin reactions were found to be mild, even in those hospital workers with the heaviest PPE use. Because the widespread and consistent use of facial masks in public settings has become a key tool in our protracted struggle with SARS-CoV-2, these findings may help to ameliorate concerns that everyday facial mask and/or other PPE usage contributes to significant dermatologic morbidity among both medical professionals and public citizens.","output":"Personal protective equipment and adverse dermatological reactions among healthcare workers: Survey observations from the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the morbidity and mortality are increasing daily.

In this study, we further characterized the mechanism of action of these four compounds using the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. It was found that GC-376 and calpain inhibitors II and XII have a dual mechanism of action by inhibiting both viral M(pro) and host cathepsin L in Vero cells. To rule out the cell-type dependent effect, the antiviral activity of these four compounds against SARS-CoV-2 was also confirmed in type 2 transmembrane serine protease-expressing Caco-2 cells using the viral yield reduction assay. In addition, we found that these four compounds have broad-spectrum antiviral activity in inhibiting not only SARS-CoV-2 but also SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, as well as human coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, OC43, and NL63. The mechanism of action is through targeting the viral M(pro), which was supported by the thermal shift-binding assay and enzymatic fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. We further showed that these four compounds have additive antiviral effect when combined with remdesivir.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a longitudinal health equity curriculum that was integrated into third-year clinical clerkships and provided experiential learning in partnership with community organizations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study was conducted from June 2017 to October 2020 to evaluate the association of the curriculum with medical students self-reported knowledge of social determinants of health and confidence working with underserved populations. Students from 1 large medical school in the southeastern US were included. Students in the class of 2019 and class of 2020 were surveyed at baseline (before the start of their third year), end of the third year, and graduation. The class of 2018 (No curriculum) was surveyed at graduation to serve as a control. Data analysis was conducted from June to September 2020. EXPOSURES: The curriculum began with a health equity simulation followed by a series of modules. The class of 2019 participated in the simulation and piloted the initial 3 modules (pilot), and the class of 2020 participated in the simulation and the full 9 modules (full). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate the change in the self-reported knowledge and confidence scores over time (potential scores ranged from 0 to 32, with higher scores indicating higher self-reported knowledge and confidence working with underserved populations). In secondary analyses, a Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to compare graduation scores between the no, pilot, and full curriculum classes. RESULTS: A total of 314 students (160 women [51.0%], 205 [65.3%] non-Hispanic White participants) completed at least 1 survey, including 125 students in the pilot, 121 in the full, and 68 in the no curriculum classes.

BACKGROUND: Myocarditis and myocardial inflammation constitute an important complication after viral infection. The frequency of myocardial involvement in seasonal influenza virus varies from 0 to 10%. The prevalence of myocardial injury among patients with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of myocarditis among unselected patients that recovered recently from SARS-CoV-2 by cardiac magnetic resonance. METHODS: We evaluated 153 consequent cardiac magnetic resonance findings that were performed from 1st of June 2020 until 15th of February 2021. Out of them, 35 patients (23%) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance due to persistent symptoms from SARS-CoV -2 infection. A conventional CMR protocol to rule out myocarditis was performed. Lake Louise Criteria were used for diagnosis of myocarditis. All scans were performed by Phillips Medical Systems Ingenia 1.5T. T1 native values were estimated elevated when mapping values measured above 1000ms, T2 mapping values were estimated elevated when greater than 55 ms. Mid wall or subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement were detected. RESULTS: Seven out of 35 patients (20%) fulfilled the Lake Louise criteria for myocarditis. The most prevalent symptoms were effort intolerance and palpitations (51% and 43% respectively). Mean age was 42  14 years, 68% were males. T1 mapping values were increased in 31% of the patients. All patients with increased native T1, had symptoms of COVID for not more than 3 months from the symptom onset. Three out of seven patients had acute myocarditis (42%). Only 25% of this group of patients needed hospitalization due to COVID infection. All 7 patients with cardiac magnetic resonance signs for myocarditis also had X-Ray and/or multi-slice computer tomography signs for atypical pneumonia. None of these patients had signs of fulminant myocarditis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of myocardial involvement after SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher than influenza virus.

The skew arises because the variability of family sizes is either inherently strong or amplified by population expansions, leading to so-called \`jackpot' events. The resulting allele frequency fluctuations are large and, therefore, challenge standard models of population genetics, which assume sufficiently narrow offspring distributions. While the neutral dynamics backward in time can be readily analyzed using coalescent approaches, we still know little about the effect of broad offspring distributions on the dynamics forward in time, especially with selection. Here, we employ an exact asymptotic analysis combined with a scaling hypothesis to demonstrate that over-dispersed frequency trajectories emerge from the competition of conventional forces, such as selection or mutations, with an emerging time-dependent sampling bias against the minor allele. The sampling bias arises from the characteristic time-dependence of the largest sampled family size within each allelic type. Using this insight, we establish simple scaling relations for allele frequency fluctuations, fixation probabilities, extinction times, and the site frequency spectra that arise when offspring numbers are distributed according to a power law $~n^{-(1+\\\\alpha)}$. To demonstrate that this coarse-grained model captures a wide variety of non-equilibrium dynamics, we validate our results in traveling waves, where the phenomenon of 'gene surfing' can produce any exponent $1<\\\\alpha<2$. We argue that the concept of a dynamic sampling bias is useful generally to develop both intuition and statistical tests for the unusual dynamics of populations with skewed offspring distributions, which can confound commonly used tests for selection or demographic history.","output":"Dynamic sampling bias and overdispersion induced by skewed offspring distributions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that during COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, emotional symptoms increased in the general population.

As part of a broader case study on challenges facing farmers in local food supply chains in Qubec, Canada, we asked farmers about the pandemic's impacts on food production and marketing in the province, including how food producers coped with these challenges. We sent an online questionnaire to 1,046 farmers who distribute food through direct marketing in Qubec, identified through consumer-facing online platforms. We conducted follow-up interviews with 15 of the 133 farmers that completed the questionnaire to gain a better understanding of their pandemic-related challenges and opportunities, as well as their adaptation needs and strategies. We identified four main types of challenges among farmers: workforce shortages, balancing food demand and supply, changes in sales outlets and marketing channels, and other operational and development issues. In turn, six key adaptation strategies helped farmers reorganize their marketing and sales, which we categorize as: redistribution, streamlining, replacement, collaboration, farm adjustment, and outlet adjustment. Most surveyed local farmers felt well-prepared to adapt to the four major challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic forged or escalated, and our findings suggest that they demonstrated remarkable resilience to additional challenges posed by the pandemic.

METHOD: We used data from the 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A total of 747 surveys were collected. We used the free social-network analysis package, GEPHI, for all network visualization using adjacency matrix representation. We additionally conducted logistic regression analysis to examine the association of selected variables with HIV status in three models representing 1) demographic and economic effects, 2) behavioral effects, and 3) prevention-intervention effects. RESULTS: The results showed 3% were tested positive. Seed 1 initiated the largest networks with 426 nodes (15 positives); seed 4 with 273 nodes (6 positives). Seed 3 had 35 nodes (2 positives). All 23 HIV diagnoses were recruited from 4 zip-codes across DC. The risk of testing positive was higher among people high-school dropouts (Relative Risk (RR) (25.645); 95 CI% 5.699, 115.987), unemployed ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), returning citizens ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645).

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all patients 16years, undergoing emergency appendicectomy during 3-month period of UK national lockdown (pandemic cohort). Data was compared to the same period one year previously (pre-pandemic cohort). Primary endpoint was nature of appendicitis (uncomplicated or complicated). Secondary endpoints were operative approach, LOS and post-operative complications. Statistical analysis was performed using Fishers Exact Test.

The size, value, and defensive factors tend to perform worse during the health crisis relative to the Great Recession, while the momentum factor shows a poor performance during the financial crisis, but a positive one during the outbreak of COVID-19. The quality factor is an extraordinary defensive factor in both crises. Similarly, this paper reports heterogeneous responses of option-implied expected market risk premia across alternative stock market indices, and between the Great Recession and the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"The Effects of the COVID-19 Crisis on Risk Factors and Option-Implied Expected Market Risk Premia: An International Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of cells from colostrum on the health of neonate calves.

Due to the associated cytokine storm, it is theorized that this triggers a hypercoagulable state for venous and arterial thromboembolism. Elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen, c-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and procalcitonin were seen in thrombotic complications. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66 year old male with dyslipidemia presented 11 days after diagnosis of COVID-19. He had worsening shortness of breath, myalgias, and loss of taste. He denied any diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. On physical exam, he had crackles with diminished lung sounds using his accessory muscles. He was hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 81% on room air. Labs showed normal WBC count, d-dimer of 1.42 mg/L, ferritin of 961 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase of 621 U/L, and CRP of 2.1 mg/dL. Chest x-ray showed atypical pneumonitis with patchy abnormalities. He was started on vapotherm 40 L with FiO2 of 100% proning as tolerated. He received dexamethasone, prophylactic enoxaparin, 1 unit of plasma therapy, remdesevir, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. On day 2, dexamethasone was increased to twice daily due to hypoxemia. Due to elevated d-dimer of 2.64 mg/L, enoxaparin was changed to twice daily. On day 5, he required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with pressure support of 10 and FiO2 of 85% with dexamethasone every eight hours. His d-dimer increased from 1.65 to 3.51 mg/L. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of chest showed extensive ground glass opacities and 2.4 x 1.9 x 1.3 cm distal thoracic aortic intraluminal thrombus. He was started on a heparin drip, and enoxaparin was discontinued. CTA of aorta showed thrombus or hypoattenuation within splenic artery and areas of wedge-shaped extending from the hilum and possible infarction with a six mm thrombus in the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Vascular surgeon recommended no surgical intervention since he was asymptomatic. His d-dimer peaked to 6.92 mg/L but trended down. After two days of heparin drip, he was transition to enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily. He remained asymptomatic with no flank pain. DISCUSSION: At least 17 cases thus far found splenic infarction as a rare thrombotic complication of COVID-19. Presentation is usually with left flank pain, which our patient did not have. Elevation of d-dimer were predictive of thrombosis complications in those hospitalized. Management includes therapeutic dose anticoagulation like subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin before being discharge home with oral anticoagulant. CONCLUSIONS: Although pulmonary embolism is the most common thromboembolism complication of COVID-19, arterial thrombosis are common especially in critically ill patients. Physicians need to consider arterial and venous thrombosis and investigate appropriately based on symptoms in order to manage. Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended for hospitalized COVID-19.

The Italian healthcare system is experiencing a stressful burden, especially in terms of intensive care assistance. In fact, the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients is represented by an acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, that in many cases, results in an acute respiratory distress syndrome and requires an invasive ventilator support. A precocious respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen should be avoided to limit the droplets' air-dispersion and the healthcare workers' contamination. The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by means of a helmet can represent an effective alternative to recruit diseased alveolar units and improve hypoxemia. It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability. However, the initiation of a CPAP is not free from pitfalls. It requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation. Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.","output":"Helmet CPAP to Treat Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure in Patients with COVID-19: A Management Strategy Proposal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV2 is dramatically impacting the global population.

The COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by Our World in Data. It is a daily updated dataset and includes confirmed cases, vaccinations, deaths, and testing data. Ordinary Least Squares was applied to examine how macro-socioeconomic measures predict the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine over time. RESULTS: The results indicate that a higher gross domestic product per capita is positively associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and this relationship becomes more robust over time. However, some countries may have more successful vaccine distribution results regardless of their gross domestic product. In addition, the result shows human development index does not have a significant relationship with vaccine distribution.

Haplotype networks were constructed in order to investigate patterns of genetic diversity among bat populations of Southeast Asia and China. No strong geographic structure was found for the four Rhinolophus species, suggesting high dispersal capacity. The ecological niche of bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 was predicted using the four localities in which bat viruses were recently discovered and the localities where bats showed the same CO1 haplotypes than virus-positive bats. The ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV was deduced from the localities where bat viruses were previously detected. The results show that the ecological niche of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV2 includes several regions of mainland Southeast Asia whereas that of bat viruses related to SARS-CoV is mainly restricted to China. In agreement with these results, human populations in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand appear to be much less affected by the Covid-19 pandemic than other countries of Southeast Asia. In the climatic transitional zone between the two ecological niches (southern Yunnan, northern Laos, northern Vietnam), genomic recombination between highly divergent viruses is more likely to occur.

Although its definitive physiological function is unknown, it may have a pathological role as the source of ectopic beats initiating atrial fibrillation. How the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker function is not clearly defined, although recent evidence indicates that changed transcriptional gene expression networks are at fault. The gene expression profile of this distinct cell type in situ was examined to investigate underlying molecular events that might contribute to atrial fibrillation. Via systems genetics, a whole-lung transcriptome data set from the BXD recombinant inbred mouse resource was analyzed, uncovering a pulmonary cardiomyocyte gene network of 24 transcripts, coordinately regulated by chromosome 1 and 2 loci. Promoter enrichment analysis and interrogation of publicly available ChIP-seq data suggested that transcription of this gene network may be regulated by the concerted activity of NKX2-5, serum response factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2, and also, at a post-transcriptional level, by RNA binding protein motif 20. Gene ontology terms indicate that this gene network overlaps with molecular markers of the stressed heart. Therefore, we propose that perturbed regulation of this gene network might lead to altered calcium handling, myocyte growth, and contractile force contributing to the aberrant electrophysiological properties observed in atrial fibrillation. We reveal novel molecular interactions and pathways representing possible therapeutic targets for atrial fibrillation.

In contrast, it is largely unknown whether host cell proteases located in the secretory pathway of infected cells and/or on the surface of target cells can cleave SARS S. We along with others could previously show that the type II transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 activates the influenza virus hemagglutinin and the human metapneumovirus F protein by cleavage. Here, we assessed whether SARS S is proteolytically processed by TMPRSS2. Western blot analysis revealed that SARS S was cleaved into several fragments upon coexpression of TMPRSS2 (cis-cleavage) and upon contact between SARS S-expressing cells and TMPRSS2-positive cells (trans-cleavage). cis-cleavage resulted in release of SARS S fragments into the cellular supernatant and in inhibition of antibody-mediated neutralization, most likely because SARS S fragments function as antibody decoys. trans-cleavage activated SARS S on effector cells for fusion with target cells and allowed efficient SARS S-driven viral entry into targets treated with a lysosomotropic agent or a cathepsin inhibitor. Finally, ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, and TMPRSS2 were found to be coexpressed by type II pneumocytes, which represent important viral target cells, suggesting that SARS S is cleaved by TMPRSS2 in the lung of SARS-CoV-infected individuals. In summary, we show that TMPRSS2 might promote viral spread and pathogenesis by diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and by activating SARS S for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion.","output":"Evidence that TMPRSS2 activates the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein for membrane fusion and reduces viral control by the humoral immune response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019 causes the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), which presents with a wide range of clinical symptoms from mild or moderate to severe and critical illnesses.

Here, we review several published foresight approaches and examples of work-related futures scenarios. We also present a working foresight framework tailored for OSH and offer recommendations for next steps to incorporate strategic foresight into research and practice in order to advance worker safety, health, and well-being.","output":"Leveraging Strategic Foresight to Advance Worker Safety, Health, and Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The competences of the immune systems of the ancient pig breed Turopolje (TT), German Landrace  Turopolje (LT) and 'modern' pig breed German Landrace  Pietrain (LP) were compared in this study. All pigs were immunized with a modified live vaccine against 'Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome' (PRRS) virus (Ingelvac PRRS MLV(?)) to simulate an infection. Antibody production against PRRS MLV was evaluated in serum. Elimination of the viral infectious fragments during the experimental period was monitored in serum, leukocytes and tonsils by RT-qPCR. Furthermore relevant immune marker genes were quantified either on gene expression level using RT-qPCR [toll like receptor (TLR) 7, TLR8, TRAF6, CD163, SIGLEC1, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL) 1, IL2, IL6, IL12], and on protein level using ELISA [interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12]. The three breeds showed individual inactivation efficiencies as a reaction to the PRRS MLV vaccination. TT eliminated the virus in serum within 16 days, followed by LT (28 days) and LP (36 days). The antibody titers against PRRS MLV of LT and LP were significantly higher compared to TT (p<0.05). The gene expression data and protein analysis of interleukins revealed that TT reacted with a type 1 immune response. In contrast, the two other breeds (LT and LP) showed a type 2 immune response, which resulted in the higher synthesis of B-cells and an increased concentration of specific anti-PRRS MLV antibodies.","output":"Comparison of the immune competence of Turopolje, German Landrace  Turopolje, and German Landrace  Pietrain pigs after PRRSV vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TLR3 provides immediate type I IFN response following entry of stimulatory PAMPs into the CNS, as it is in HSV infection. The receptor plays a vital role in astrocytes, contributing to rapid infection sensing and suppression of viral replication, precluding the spread of virus beyond neurons. The route of TLR3 mobilization culminating in the receptor activation remains unexplained. In this research, we investigated the involvement of various types of endosomes in the regulation of the TLR3 mobility in C8-D1A murine astrocyte cell line. TLR3 was transported rapidly to early EEA1-positive endosomes as well as LAMP1-lysosomes following stimulation with the poly(I:C). Later, TLR3 largely associated with late Rab7-positive endosomes. Twenty-four hours after stimulation, TLR3 co-localized with LAMP1 abundantly in lysosomes of astrocytes. TLR3 interacted with poly(I:C) intracellularly from 1 min to 8 h following cell stimulation. We detected TLR3 on the surface of astrocytes indicating constitutive expression, which increased after poly(I:C) stimulation. Our findings contribute to the understanding of cellular modulation of TLR3 trafficking. Detailed analysis of the TLR3 transportation pathway is an important component in disclosing the fate of the receptor in HSV-infected CNS and may help in the search for rationale therapeutics to control the replication of neuropathic viruses.","output":"Participation of Endosomes in Toll-Like Receptor 3 Transportation Pathway in Murine Astrocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the early phases of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, health system leaders faced the urgent task of translating the unknown into forecasting models for hospital capacity. Our study objective was to demonstrate the application of a practical, locally informed model to estimate the hospital capacity needed even though the community COVID-19 caseload was unknown. Methods: We developed a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that was adopted from the University of Pennsylvania COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics and employed at 8 hospitals within Ochsner Health, the largest integrated delivery system in Louisiana, between March 16 and April 15, 2020. Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions of cases in the New Orleans area were used to estimate the community case load when testing was delayed. Results: Initially, the observed ICU census trended near R(0)=2.0, whereas the ventilator census trended between R(0)=2.0 and 3.0. After implementing social distancing, both the ICU and ventilator capacity trended toward R(0)=1.3, while non-ICU medical/surgical beds trended toward R(0)=1.5. The model accurately predicted peak ICU (n=250) and hospital bed (n=487) usage by April 6, 2020. In response to model trends, Ochsner added 130 ICU beds across its hospitals by opening a new ICU and converting operating rooms and parts of emergency departments to ICU beds. Conclusion: When disease testing is limited or results are delayed, ICU admissions data can inform SIR models of the rate of spread of COVID-19 in a community. Our model used various R(0) plots to demonstrate an array of scenarios to guide planning for hospital and political leaders.","output":"Locally Informed Modeling to Predict Hospital and Intensive Care Unit Capacity During the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Performance of point-of-care tests in different clinical scenarios and on different samples remains undetermined. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of the nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen Rapid-Test-Device. METHOD: Prospective study including consecutive patients attending three primary care centers (PCC) and an emergency department. The antigen test was performed at point-of-care in nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs, and in saliva. Positive and negative percent agreement (PPA, NPA) were calculated with the RT-PCR assay as reference standard. RESULTS: Of 913 patients included, 296 (32.3%) were asymptomatic and 690 (75.6%) came from the PCC. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 913, nasal swabs from 659, and saliva from 611 patients. RT-PCR was positive in 196 (21.5%) nasopharyngeal samples (NPS). Overall PPA (95% CI) in NPS was 60.5% (53.3-67.4), and it was lower in nasal swabs (44.7%) and saliva (23.1%). Test performance in NPS was largely dependent on the cycle threshold (Ct) in RT-PCR, with PPA of 94% for Ct25 and 80% for Ct<30. In symptomatic patients, the PPA was 95% for Ct25; 85% for Ct<30, and 89% for the symptom triad of fever, cough and malaise. Performance was also dependent on age, with PPA of 100% in symptomatic patients >50 years with Ct<25. In asymptomatic patients, the PPA was 86% for Ct<25. In all cases, NPA was 100%.

An association between ABO blood groups and SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the severity of COVID-19 has been suggested relatively early during the pandemic and gained enormously high public interest. It was postulated that blood group A predisposes to a higher risk of infection as well as to a much higher risk of severe respiratory disease and that people with blood group O are less frequently and less severely affected by the disease. However, as to the severity of COVID-19, a thorough summary of the existing literature does not support these assumptions in general. Accordingly, at this time, there is no reason to suppose that knowledge of a patients ABO phenotype should directly influence therapeutical decisions in any way. On the other hand, there are many data available supporting an association between the ABO blood groups and the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. To explain this association, several interactions between the virus and the host cell membrane have been proposed which will be discussed here.

Increased COVID-19 disease severity may be associated with increased risk for viremia and placental infection. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and preterm birth, that can be either placentally-mediated or reflected in the placenta. Maternal viremia followed by placental infection may lead to maternal-fetal transmission (vertical), which affects 1-3% of exposed newborns. However, there is no agreed-upon or standard definition of placental infection. NIH/NICHD convened a group of experts to propose a working definition of placental infection to inform ongoing studies of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Experts recommended that placental infection be defined using techniques that allow virus detection and localization in placental tissue by one or more of the following methods: in-situ hybridization with anti-sense probe (detects replication) and/or a sense probe (detects viral genome or immunohistochemistry to detect viral nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins. If the above methods are not possible, RT-PCR detection and/or quantification of viral RNA in placental homogenates, or electron microscopy are alternative approaches. A graded classification for the likelihood of placental infection as definitive, probable, possible, and unlikely was proposed. Manuscripts reporting placental infection should describe the sampling method (location and number of samples collected), method of preservation of tissue, and detection technique.

The versatile functionality of Nef is partially attributed to different conformational states and posttranslational modifications, such as myristoylation. Up to now, many interaction partners of Nef have been identified using classical yeast two-hybrid screens. Such screens rely on transcriptional activation of reporter genes in the nucleus to detect interactions. Thus, the identification of Nef interaction partners that are integral membrane proteins, membrane-associated proteins or other proteins that do not translocate into the nucleus is hampered. In the present study, a split-ubiquitin based yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify novel membrane-localized interaction partners of Nef. More than 80% of the hereby identified interaction partners of Nef are transmembrane proteins. The identified hits are GPM6B, GPM6A, BAP31, TSPAN7, CYB5B, CD320/TCblR, VSIG4, PMEPA1, OCIAD1, ITGB1, CHN1, PH4, CLDN10, HSPA9, APR-3, PEBP1 and B3GNT, which are involved in diverse cellular processes like signaling, apoptosis, neurogenesis, cell adhesion and protein trafficking or quality control.

Most reported data relate to incidence, risk factors, and outcome of severe COVID-19. The safety of systemic anti-cancer therapy in oncology patients with non-severe COVID-19 is an important matter in daily practice. METHODS: ONCOSARS-1 was a single-center, academic observational study. Adult patients with solid tumors treated in the oncology day unit with systemic anti-cancer therapy during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium were prospectively included. All patients (n = 363) underwent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological testing after the first peak of the pandemic in Belgium. Additionally, 141 of these patients also had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the pandemic. The main objective was to retrospectively determine the safety of systemic cancer treatment, measured by the rate of adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. RESULTS: Twenty-two (6%) of the 363 eligible patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and/or serology. Of these, three required transient oxygen supplementation, but none required admission to the intensive care unit. Hematotoxicity was the only adverse event more frequently observed in SARS-CoV-2 -positive patients than in SARS-CoV-2-negative patients: 73% vs 35% (P < 0.001). This association remained significant (odds ratio (OR) 4.1, P = 0.009) even after adjusting for performance status and type of systemic treatment. Hematological adverse events led to more treatment delays for the SARS-CoV-2-positive group: 55% vs 20% (P < 0.001). Median duration of treatment interruption was similar between the two groups: 14 and 11 days, respectively. Febrile neutropenia, infections unrelated to COVID-19, and bleeding events occurred at a low rate in the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Systemic anti-cancer therapy appeared safe in ambulatory oncology patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were, however, more treatment delays in the SARS-CoV-2-positive population, mainly due to a higher rate of hematological adverse events.","output":"Safety of systemic anti-cancer treatment in oncology patients with non-severe COVID-19: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past few months, in a world closed to face-to-face service delivery and social interaction, we have adapted and, for the most part, realized the importance of being apart to keep us all safe.

Facing this largescale infectious public health event, everyone is under great psychological pressure. The aim was to investigate the psychological status of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: The online cross-sectional study involving 922 participants (656 medical staff and 266 general population) was conducted in China between February and March, 2020. The psychological status was evaluated using the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90). Linear and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the effect in the study. RESULTS: Of the 922 participants, approximately 18.3% had psychological health problems. The score of the SCL-90 was significant higher in medical staff (mean = 1.49) than that in general population (mean = 1.36). In addition, the participants enrolled in March were less likely to have psychological health problems than in February (odds ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.59).

COVID-19 symptoms were classified as asymptomatic, nonrespiratory, or respiratory. Infectiousness was calculated from 2 days prior to 14 days after symptom onset or positive test. Cases were defined as healthcare-associated COVID-19 when infection was acquired from the wards under investigation. COVID-19 exposures were calculated based on symptoms and bed proximity to an infectious patient. Risk ratios and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated from univariable and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 153 patients, 65 were COVID-19 patients and 45 of these were healthcare-associated cases. Exposure to a COVID-19 patient with respiratory symptoms was associated with healthcare-associated infection irrespective of proximity (aOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.6.3C8.87).

Methods: Using a critical realist ontology and epistemology, we undertook an online survey of health professionals subscribing to the Australian Telehealth Society newsletter. The survey had close- and open-ended questions, constructed to identify contextual changes in the operating environment for telehealth services, and assess the mechanisms which had contributed to these changes. We applied descriptive and McNemar's Chi-square analysis for the close-ended component of the survey, and a reflexive thematic analysis approach for the open-ended questions which were framed within the activity based funding system which had previously limited telehealth services to regional Australia. Results: Of the 91 respondents most (73%) reported a higher volume of telephone-based care since COVID and an increase in use of video consultations (60% of respondents). Respondents felt that the move to provide care using telehealth services had been a forced adoption where clinicians began to use telehealth services (often for the first time) to maintain health care. Respondents noted significant changes in managerial and medical culture which supported the legitimisation of telehealth services as a mode of access to care. The support of leaders and the use personal and organisational networks to facilitate the operation of telehealth service were felt to be particularly valuable. Access to, and reliability of, the technology were considered extremely important for services. Respondents also welcomed the increased availability of more human and financial resources. Conclusions: During the pandemic, mechanisms that legitimise practise, build confidence, support relationships and supply resources have fostered the use of telehealth.

Several studies on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) describe a high risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). The majority of PEs in patients with COVID-19 were in the segmental arteries. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of PE in patients with COVID-19 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Other risk factors of PE were taken into consideration. Patients and Methods: This study is a single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study that used a non-probability consecutive sampling technique to select the patients. The local institutional review boards approved the study protocol. Overall, 91 consecutive patients who were older than 18 years of age and who had a computerized tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography were included in this study. Results: Ninety-one patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, of whom 46 (50.5%) were females and 45 (49.5%) were males. The study populations age ranged from 19 to 87 with a mean age of 59  15 years. PE was documented in 11 patients (12.1%).

Here, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts the already altered CCG levels in solid or haematological malignancies, specifically whether there is a protective effect or rather a potentially higher risk for major COVID-19 complications in cancer patients due to elevated CCGs linked to cancer progression. Serially analysing immune responses with 55 CCGs in cancer patients under active treatment with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first showed that cancer patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=54) demonstrate elevated levels of 35 CCGs compared to the non-cancer, non-infected control group of health care workers (n=42). Of the 35 CCGs, 19 were common to both solid and haematological malignancy groups and comprised previously described cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-, IL-1Ra, IL-17A, and VEGF, but also several less well described cytokines/chemokines such as Fractalkine, Tie-2, and T cell chemokine CTACK. Importantly, we show here that 7 CCGs are significantly altered in SARS-CoV-2 exposed cancer patients (n=52).

In the medical context, it is not easy to find suitable test formats to assess the competencies involved in working hygienically. Pre-existing test formats usually use self-report questionnaires, which are suboptimal for this purpose. Methods: We designed a Situational Judgement Test (SJT) to assess hygiene competence. The SJT incorporates reliable measures and is a good predictor of job performance. The test consists of twenty pictures (items) presenting only one unambiguous hygiene lapse. Test respondents were asked (1) to note down whether they recognized a problem in the picture in respect of hygiene guidelines and (2), if yes, to describe the problem in a short verbal response. The sample comprised n = 149 health care professionals (79.1% female;age: M = 26.7 years, SD = 7.3 years) working as clinicians or nurses. The written responses were rated by two independent raters with high agreement ( > .80), indicating high reliability of the measurement. We then used Item Response Theory (IRT) for data analysis. Results: The reported IRT analyses show that the test is suitable to assess hygiene competence and that it is possible to distinguish between persons demonstrating different levels of ability for seventeen of the twenty items/pictures), expecially for the range of low to medium person abilities. Conclusions: The test in its present form can be used to assess the hygiene competence of medical students, medical doctors, nurses and trainee nurses in cross-sectional measurements. In order to broaden the difficulty spectrum of the current test, additional test items with higher difficulty should be developed. The Situational Judgement Test designed to assess hygiene competence can be helpful in testing and teaching the ability of working hygienically.","output":"Measuring Hygiene Competence: A Vignette-Based Situational Judgement Test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has spread across the globe with more than 6 lakh deaths. Clinical autopsies are important to understand the pathobiology of the disease. Materials and Methods Autopsy techniques have been modified to be minimally invasive autopsies in all COVID-19 positive cases, and tissue biopsies were sampled from lungs, liver, and bone marrow within an hour after death. Detailed histological analysis was performed in the sampled tissues, along with immunohistochemistry. Patients clinical records were collected. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data. Results Of the 21 cases studied, 76.2% patients were  60 years of age, 80.9% were males, and 85.7% had co-morbidities. Histopathological analysis revealed diffuse alveolar damage (including exudative and organizing phase) in 88.9% cases. Microthrombi were seen in 44.4% cases. Additional findings include viral cytopathic changes, metaplastic change in the epithelium, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema. Liver showed centrizonal congestion with hepatocytic loss, lobular inflammation, steatosis, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltration, while significant portal infiltrate and cholestasis were absent to minimal. Bone marrow revealed hemophagocytosis in 60% cases. Conclusion Incorporation of minimally invasive autopsies provides an effective method to study the pathological findings in COVID-19 deaths in resource-constrained settings. Presence of pulmonary microthrombi in a significant number of cases supports the vascular events, apart from the characteristic diffuse alveolar damage, as an important pathogenic mechanism for lung injury in COVID-19 infections. Histopathological findings in the liver and bone marrow suggest indirect insult to these organs, related to circulatory and/or hyperinflammatory response to viral infections.","output":"Evaluation of Pathological Findings of COVID-19 by Minimally Invasive Autopsies: A Single Tertiary Care Center Experience from India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has resulted in 81,603 confirmed cases in China, among the 334,981 cases confirmed in 189 countries as of 09:00 am, March 24, 2020 (China central standard time).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the anxiety and depression and general effect of COVID-19 pandemic on AR patients' psychological status in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In October 2019, 222 outpatients suffering from AR in our department and 133 healthy controls were enrolled. All participants were asked to finish the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire. The demographic characteristics and the severity of AR symptoms were recorded. In April 2020, the AR patients and healthy controls were re-contacted to finish the questionnaires by telephone or online. The SAS and SDS scores in AR patients and healthy controls and the correlation with other variables were analyzed. RESULTS: For AR patients, the SAS and SDS scores were significantly higher than healthy controls. Meanwhile, the rates of anxiety and depression were 24.8% and 19.4% respectively. The education level and symptoms severity were correlated with SAS and SDS scores. Ninety-eight AR patients and 56 healthy controls finished the questionnaires after COVID-19 pandemic. The AR patients' SAS and SDS scores were lower than before COVID-19 pandemic and were correlated with AR symptom scores. The scores of healthy controls were not different with before COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of anxiety and depression is common in AR patients.

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, shows excellent efficacy against stroke and deep vein thrombosis in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine serum apixaban concentrations and anti-factor Xa activity in horses after orally administered apixaban. Five horses received a single dose of intravenous (0.09 mg/kg) and oral (1 mg/kg) apixaban in a cross-over design. Serum apixaban concentrations and anti-Xa activity were measured serially via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a commercial assay, respectively, for 12 hr following oral administration. Apixaban was detected in all horses after both oral and intravenous administration. Oral administration yielded a mean maximum concentration of 60.3 ng/ml (59.4-111 ng/ml), mean time to maximum concentration of 0.5 hr (0.5-2), mean half-life of 6.2 hr (4.6-8.3), and mean oral bioavailability of 10% (3.8-17.4). After oral administration, anti-Xa activity had a strong positive relationship with serum apixaban and was best represented by a dose-response model with the following parameters: E0 = 5.00 ng/ml, EMAX = 311 ng/mL, EC50 = 267 ng/ml, and n = 1.58. Anti-Xa activity was significantly higher 2 hr post-administration compared with baseline (p = .032).

In this study, computational screening is performed by molecular docking of 1615 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Several promising approved drugs, including Simeprevir, Ergotamine, Bromocriptine and Tadalafil, stand out as the best candidates based on their binding energy, fitting score and noncovalent interactions at the binding sites of the receptor. All selected drugs interact with the key active site residues, including His41 and Cys145. Various noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, pi-sulfur and pi-pi interactions appear to be dominant in drug-Mpro complexes. MD simulations are applied for the most promising drugs. Structural stability and compactness are observed for the drug-Mpro complexes. The protein shows low flexibility in both apo and holo form during MD simulations. The MM/PBSA binding free energies are also measured for the selected drugs. For pattern recognition, structural similarity and binding energy prediction, multiple linear regression (MLR) models are used for the quantitative structural-activity relationship. The binding energy predicted by MLR model shows an 82% accuracy with the binding energy determined by molecular docking.

Influenza virus has been around for centuries and is one of the most successful, and consequently most studied human viruses. This has generated tremendous amount of data and information, thus it is pertinent to summarise these for, particularly interdisciplinary readers. Viruses are acellular organisms and exist at the interface of living and non-living. Due to this unique characteristic, viruses require another organism, i.e. host to survive. Viruses multiply inside the host cell and are obligate intracellular pathogens, because their relationship with the host is almost always harmful to host. In mammalian cells, the life cycle of a virus, including influenza is divided into five main steps: attachment, entry, synthesis, assembly and release. To complete these steps, some viruses, e.g. influenza utilise all three parts - plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus, of the cell; whereas others, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 utilise only plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Hence, viruses interact with numerous host factors to complete their life cycle, and these interactions are either exploitative or antagonistic in nature. The host factors involved in the life cycle of a virus could be divided in two broad categories - proviral and antiviral. This perspective has endeavoured to assimilate the information about the host factors which promote and suppress influenza virus infection. Furthermore, an insight into host factors that play a dual role during infection or contribute to influenza virus-host adaptation and disease severity has also been provided.","output":"Host factors involved in influenza virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The 2019 Novel coronavirus disease puts a serious burden on the health system.

Induction of cell death following reovirus infection is initiated by the incoming viral capsid proteins during cell entry and occurs via NF-B-dependent activation of classical apoptotic pathways. Prototype reovirus strain T3D displays a higher cell-killing potential than strain T1L. To investigate how signaling pathways initiated by T3D and T1L differ, we methodically analyzed cell death pathways activated by these two viruses in L929 cells. We found that T3D activates NF-B, initiator caspases, and effector caspases to a significantly greater extent than T1L. Surprisingly, blockade of NF-B or caspases did not affect T3D-induced cell death. Cell death following T3D infection resulted in a reduction in cellular ATP levels and was sensitive to inhibition of the kinase activity of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1). Furthermore, membranes of T3D-infected cells were compromised. Based on the dispensability of caspases, a requirement for RIP1 kinase function, and the physiological status of infected cells, we conclude that reovirus can also induce an alternate, necrotic form of cell death described as necroptosis. We also found that induction of necroptosis requires synthesis of viral RNA or proteins, a step distinct from that necessary for the induction of apoptosis.

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged 18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2C10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavirCritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. Findings Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 123 [95% CI 087C175]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 152 [095C243]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. Interpretation In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the National Cancer Data Base to investigate whether there is an association between a &#8805; 90-day delay from transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in initiating CRT and overall survival. We included patients with cT2-4N0M0 muscle-invasive bladder cancer from 2004 to 2015 who underwent TURBT and curative-intent concurrent CRT. Patients were grouped on the basis of timing of CRT: &#8804; 89 days after TURBT (earlier) vs. &#8805; 90 and < 180 days after TURBT (delayed). RESULTS: A total of 1387 (87.5%) received earlier CRT (median, 45 days after TURBT; interquartile range, 34-59 days), and 197 (12.5%) received delayed CRT (median, 111 days after TURBT; interquartile range, 98-130 days). Median overall survival was 29.0 months (95% CI, 26.0-32.0) versus 27.0 months (95% CI, 19.75-34.24) for earlier and delayed CRT (P = .94). On multivariable analysis, delayed CRT was not associated with an overall survival difference (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.87-1.27; P = .60). CONCLUSION: Although these results are limited and require validation, short, strategic treatment delays during a pandemic can be considered on the basis of clinician judgment.","output":"Management of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer During a Pandemic: Impact of Treatment Delay on Survival Outcomes for Patients Treated With Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in the city of Wuhan in China and has widely spread worldwide. While human strains of coronavirus (CoV) are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly CoV strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes, and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Common clinical signs of the infection comprises of respiratory symptoms in the form of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection results in pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. Standard recommendations advocated to prevent spread of infection consist of frequent hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing. This article, based on our experience and relevant guidelines and research, introduces essential knowledge about CoV in dental settings and provides recommended management protocols for dental practitioners affected areas.","output":"Corona virus disease bring a new challenge for the dentistry: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the United States is increasing, and it remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States for men and women combined. The American Cancer Society now recommends that adults aged 45 years and older with an average risk of CRC undergo regular screening with either a high sensitivity stool-based test or structural (visual) examination, depending on patient preference and test availability. The primary objective of this quality improvement project was to determine if reminder methods, such as telephone or letter reminders, increased the return rate of fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) for colorectal cancer screening. Methods: At public outreach events and daily clinics in the West Texas Panhandle area, participants in the GET FIT program were provided with FIT kits after completing the education on colorectal cancer. Participants who fit the inclusion criteria and had received a FIT kit from the program were included. They were instructed on how to perform the test and mail it back. Participants that did not return the completed kits within two weeks were reminded either by 1) through a reminder letter or 2) by telephone every 2 weeks (+/- 3 days) for 60 days or 5 attempts to contact. We de-identified and analyzed the FIT kit return data from June-November 2019 before instituting these reminder methods. We then calculated the change in return rates from December 2019 to February 2020. Our goal was to increase the FIT return rates by 25% over the baseline return rate. Results: The pre-intervention return rate of kits for June-November 2019 was 67.58%, and the postintervention return rate for December 2019-February 2020 was 81.87%. This rate was equal to an approximately 21% increase in return rates. The average return rate of FIT kits overall was 72.34%. The average rate of returned new patient kits was 69%, and the average % of new patient return kits was 68.51%. We also noticed a significant increase in return of FIT tests after a community cancer screening in October 2019. Conclusion: Fecal immunohistochemical test (FIT) remains one of the primary options for colorectal cancer screening. Due to its lower cost and noninvasiveness, FIT was offered to patients at average risk.We did achieve a significant increase in return rates, although we did not meet our target goal for this project.

METHODS: This study was restrospective, observational study of 109 crtitcally ill intubated patients with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit(ICU) university hospital from 01 of July to 30 December 2021. RESULTS: In 53 of 109 intubated patients (48.0%) have identified the secondary bacterial infection after 48 hours of intubation and common risk factors associated with invasive mechanical ventilation in patients were:age(p<0.001);lack of use of high nasal cannula(p<0.004);high level of D-dimer(p<0.002);lymphopenia(p<0.001);and low albumin level (p<0.003).Multi-drug-resistant (MDR)pathogens were identified in 37 of 53 patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia(71.0%). In patients with VAP mixed ground glasses/consolidative radiological pattern was common compared to intubated but non-VAP patients(p<0.001).However, in patients with MDR pathogen associated VAP local lung complications such as pleural effusions and lung destructions were commonest compared to non-MDR pathogen associated VAP(p<0.001 and <0.0001;respectively).Among MDR pathogens commonest were:Acinotebacter baumanii(37.0%);Pseudomonas aeruginosa(29.0%) and MRSA(18.0%).MDR pathogen related to VAP in patients was associated with more high median SOFA score (p<0.001) and severe sepsis and septic shock was higher compared to non-MDR VAP patients( OR 4.67 [0.98-8.94]95%CI;p<0.01) and patients with MDR VAP were more resistant to the ventilatory support and their median PaO2/FiO2 was 132(89-194) which was significantly lower compared to non-MDR VAP patients(171[120-254];p<0.001).Serum lactete level, serun creatinine level(acute kidney failure), and serum D-dimer level were significantly higher compared to non-MDR VAP patients(p<0.001 for all three data respectively).Overall mortality rate among intubated patients was 58.0%(64 of 109), however, secondary bacterial infection was associated with higher mortality rate compared to non-VAP patients(73.0% vs 44.0%;p<0.05).MDR pathogen related to VAP patients were characterized with higher in -hopspital mortality compared to non-MDR pathogen related to VAP patients(81.0%vs 52.0%;p<0.05) CONCLUSIONS: Intubated and critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for development of ventilator -associated pneumonia and commonly such pneumonias are associated with MDR pathogens.Secondary MDR pathogen associated infection in intubated patients commonly is associated with severe sepsis and septick shock, kidney failure and among local lung complications with pleural effusions and lung destructions.MDR pathogents in such patients associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

The objective of our study was to compare transmissibility across four major lineages (L1-4) of Mtb among participants from two cohort studies in Pune, India. Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Mtb sputum culture-positive isolates from participants in two prospective cohort studies of adults with pulmonary TB seeking care at public treatment centers in Pune, Maharashtra. We performed genotypic susceptibility prediction for both first- and second-line drugs using a previously validated random forest model. We used single nucleotide substitutions (SNS) and maximum likelihood estimation to build isolate phylogenies by lineage. We used Bayesian molecular dating to estimate ancestral node ages and compared tree characteristics using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. Results: Of the 642 isolates from distinct study participants that underwent WGS, 612 met sequence quality criteria. The median age of the 612 participants was 31 years (IQR 24.4-44.2), the majority were male (64.7%) and sputum smear-positive (83.3%), and 6.7% had co-infection with HIV. Most isolates belonged to L3 (44.6%). The majority (61.1%) of multidrug-resistant isolates (MDR, resistant to isoniazid and rifampin) belonged to L2 (P < 0.001 [Fisher's Exact]). There was no significant difference in host characteristics between participants infected with the four major lineages. In phylogenetic analysis, we measured shorter terminal branch lengths in the L2 tree compared to L1 and L3 trees indicating less time elapsing between transmission and sampling and higher transmissibility (median branch lengths: L2 - 3.3, L3 - 7.8, p <0.001). Branching times for L2 and L4 were more recent than L1 and L3 indicating recent introduction into the region (p < 0.01 [KS test]). Conclusion: Modern Mtb lineages (L2 and L4) were more recently introduced in western India, compared to older lineages (L1 and L3). L2 shows a higher frequency of drug-resistance and higher transmissibility. Our findings highlight the need for contact tracing around cases of TB due to L2, and heightened surveillance of TB antibiotic resistance in India.","output":"Modern lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were recently introduced in western India and demonstrate increased transmissibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively assessed the fit failure rate of N95 respirators according to the number of donning/doffing and hours worn. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: A tertiary-care referral center in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 10 infection control practitioners participated in the fit test. METHODS: The first experiment comprised 4 consecutive 1-hour donnings and fit tests between each donning. The second experiment comprised 2 consecutive 3-hour donnings and fit tests between each donning. The final experiment comprised fit tests after an 1-hour donning or a 2-hour donning. RESULTS: For 1-hour donnings, 60%, 70%, and 90% of the participants had fit failures after 2, 3, and 4 consecutive donnings, respectively. For 3-hour donnings, 50% had fit failure after the first donning and 70% had failures after 2 consecutive donnings. All participants passed the fit test after refitting whenever fit failure occurred. The final experiment showed that 50% had fit failure after a single use of 1 hour, and 30% had fit failure after a single use of 2 hours. CONCLUSIONS: High fit-failure rates were recorded after repeated donning and extended use of N95 respirators. Caution is needed for reuse (1 time) and extended use (1 hour) of N95 respirators in high-risk settings such as those involving aerosol-generating procedures. Although adequate refitting may recover the fit factor, the use of clean gloves and strict hand hygiene afterward should be ensured when touching the outer surfaces of N95 respirators for refitting.","output":"Fit-failure rate associated with simulated reuse and extended use of N95 respirators assessed by a quantitative fit test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary complications are the most common clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

METHODS All psychiatric admissions aged 65 or older in the 3 months before and after COVID-19 (from November 2019 to April 2020), in the previous 2 years (from November 2017 to April 2018 and from November 2018 to April 2019), and in the year of SARS (from November 2002 to April 2003) in a major gazette inpatient psychiatric unit in Hong Kong, which serves a catchment population of 1.4 million, were anonymously reviewed. The number of psychogeriatric admissions between different timeframes was compared, and factors that might explain the increase in admissions following COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS Psychogeriatric admissions increased by 21.4% following the COVID-19 outbreak. This increase was not explained by seasonal variation, and was greater and lasted longer than that in SARS. A rising trend in admissions for older adults living in residential care homes was observed. The increase in admissions was associated with fewer outpatient attendance, fewer home visits by nurses, and more older adults with dementia requiring inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health, greater demand for inpatient psychogeriatric services in COVID-19 than in SARS, and the importance of maintaining support for community-living older adults, in particular those with dementia, and their caregivers in reducing the needs for inpatient psychiatric treatment during the pandemic.

Each year EBV associated cancers account for over 200,000 new cases of cancer and cause 150,000 deaths world-wide. EBV is also the primary cause of infectious mononucleosis, and up to 70% of adolescents and young adults in developed countries suffer from infectious mononucleosis. In addition, EBV has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. An EBV prophylactic vaccine that induces neutralizing antibodies holds great promise for prevention of EBV associated diseases. EBV envelope proteins including gH/gL, gB and gp350 play key roles in EBV entry and infection of target cells, and neutralizing antibodies elicited by each of these proteins have shown to prevent EBV infection of target cells and markedly decrease EBV titers in the peripheral blood of humanized mice challenged with lethal dose EBV. Recent studies demonstrated that immunization with the combination of gH/gL, gB and/or gp350 induced markedly increased synergistic EBV neutralizing activity compared to immunization with individual proteins. As previous clinical trials focused on gp350 alone were partially successful, the inclusion of gH/gL and gB in a vaccine formulation with gp350 represents a promising approach of EBV prophylactic vaccine development. Therapeutic EBV vaccines have also been tested clinically with encouraging results. Immunization with various vaccine platforms expressing the EBV latent proteins EBNA1, LMP1, and/or LMP2 promoted specific CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic responses with anti-tumor activity. The addition of EBV envelope proteins gH/gL, gB and gp350 has the potential to increase the efficacy of a therapeutic EBV vaccine. The immune system plays a critical role in the control of tumors, and immune cell therapy has emerged as a promising treatment of cancers. Adoptive T-cell therapy has been successfully used in the prevention and treatment of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

Yet, limited information exists on the longer-term (>6 months) effects of iCBT and adherence to these interventions. OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal (12 months) effectiveness of a fully automated, self-guided iCBT intervention called Thrive, designed to enhance engagement with a rural population of adults with depression symptoms. The secondary aim was to determine whether the program adherence enhanced the effectiveness of the Thrive intervention. METHODS We analyzed data from 181 adults who used the Thrive intervention. Using self-reports, participants were evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months for the primary outcome of depression symptom severity using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale and secondary outcome measures, namely, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) scores, Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) scores, Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) scores, and suicidal ideation (ninth item of the PHQ-9 scale) scores. The Thrive program adherence was measured using the numbers of program logins, page views, and lessons completed. RESULTS The assessment response rates for 8-week, 6-month, and 12-month outcomes were 58.6% (106/181), 50.3% (91/181), and 51.4% (93/181), respectively. By 8 weeks, significant improvements were observed for all outcome measures. These improvements were maintained at 12 months with mean reductions in severities of depression (mean -6.5; P<.001) and anxiety symptoms (mean -4.3; P<.001). Improvements were also observed in work and social functioning (mean -6.9; P<.001) and resilience (mean 4.3; P<.001). Marked decreases were observed in suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 ninth item score >1) at 6 months (16.5%) and 12 months (17.2%) compared to baseline (39.8%) (P<.001). In regard to the program adherence, cumulative counts of page views and lessons completed were significantly related to lower PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WSAS scores and higher CD-RISC-10 scores (all P values <.001 with an exception of page views with WSAS for which P value was .02). CONCLUSIONS The Thrive intervention was effective at reducing depression and anxiety symptom severity and improving functioning and resilience among a population of adults from mostly rural communities in the United States. These gains were maintained at 1 year. Program adherence, measured by the number of logins and lessons completed, indicates that users who engage more with the program benefit more from the intervention.

Ignoring the ethical impacts of information and communication technology health service delivery creates an unintended risk for patients and can lead to reduced effectiveness, noncompliance, and harm, undermining the best intentions of governments and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore how ethical considerations or impacts may be different, greater, or more variable in information and communication technology methods versus face-to-face health care delivery models, and how they may be applied in practice. METHODS: We undertook a systemic literature review to provide a critical overview of existing research into the incorporation of ethical principles into telehealth practice. Six databases were searched between March 2016 to May 2016 and again in December 2020 to provide the benefit of currency. A combination of broad terms (\\"ethics,\\" \\"ethical,\\" \\"health,\\" and \\"care\\") with the restrictive terms of \\"telehealth\\" and \\"telemedicine\\" was used in keyword searches. Thematic analysis and synthesis of each paper was conducted, aligned to the framework developed by Beauchamp and Childress. RESULTS: From the 49 papers reviewed, authors identified or discussed the following ethical principles in relation to telehealth practice: autonomy (69% of authors, 34/49), professional-patient relationship (53% of authors, 26/49), nonmaleficence (41% of authors, 20/49), beneficence (39%, of authors, 19/49), and justice (39% of authors, 19/49). CONCLUSIONS: Although a small number of studies identified ethical issues associated with telehealth practice and discussed their potential impact on service quality and effectiveness, there is limited research on how ethical principles are incorporated into clinical practice.

Dichotomous variables of our outcomes of interest were analyzed using Maentel-Haenszel formula to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with random-effects modeling regardless of heterogeneity. Results Five studies with a total of 1190 patients and were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The use of JAK inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28C0.93, P = 0.02;I2: 7.8%, P = 0.354) and clinical improvement (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.05C2.95, P = 0.032;I2: 26.4%, P = 0.253). The use of JAK inhibitors was not associated with a reduced risk of clinical deterioration (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28C1.19, P = 0.136;I2: 24.1%, P = 0.267). Conclusion The use of JAK inhibitors was significantly associated with a reduced risk of mortality, and clinical improvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","output":"The use of Janus Kinase inhibitors in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with pulmonary embolism, a condition mechanistically related to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our objective was to identify whether VEGF levels, measured at hospital admission, may predict the occurrence of pulmonary embolism (and other thrombosis) during hospitalization. Of a total of 139 patients included in the study, a pulmonary embolism occurred in 4%, other thrombosis in 16%, and 80% remained thrombus free. Clinical and laboratory data at admission were similar among groups. VEGF levels were elevated in COVID-19 patients compared with 38 healthy controls (50.7 versus 15.0 pg/mL; P < 0.001), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.776. At a cutoff point >15.7 pg/mL, VEGF showed 64.7% sensitivity, 92.1% specificity, and a positive likelihood ratio of 8.2 to discriminate COVID-19. In COVID-19, VEGF levels were not different in patients with pulmonary embolism, other thrombosis, and thrombus-free patients (15.0 versus 84.0 versus 48.5 pg/mL, respectively; P = 0.19). VEGF correlated with C-reactive protein ( = 0.25), fibrinogen ( = 0.28), ferritin ( = 0.18), and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( = 0.20).

METHODS: Enrolled participants were interviewed online via a phone call after obtaining their informed consent. Quantification of smell, taste, and other sensations before, during, and after COVID-19 infection was correlated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 500 (mild C severe) COVID-19 patients completed the survey. A total of 26.4% were asymptomatic, and 21.4% were classified as paucisymptomatic with less severe symptoms. Almost equal proportions of the studied population experienced extreme taste sensation reductions (43%) and loss of smell sensation (44%). Statistically significant drastic decreases in smell and taste senses were seen among younger ages. The magnitude of reduction in both sense changes increased steeply from the asymptomatic group to the paucisymptomatic group to the symptomatic group.

The molecular effects were elucidated through transcriptomic RNA-seq and gene expression qPCR analysis and the physiological responses were evaluated through qualitative analysis of pigments and proline content, membrane stability, and lipid peroxidation. ALPAN? was shown to adjust the transcriptional response by upregulating genes involved in source to sink carbohydrate metabolism and translocation, stomatal closure, and cell homeostasis. ALPAN? was shown to mitigate the deteriorating effects of water deficit on the physiological status of the plants by stabilizing the levels of the photosynthetic pigments, regulating the accumulation of osmo-protectants, and preserving the cell wall lipid bilayer from oxidation. In conclusion, transcriptomic and physiological analysis provided insightful information on the biostimulant effects, indicating a positive role of ALPAN? foliar application in alleviating the negative costs of water deficit.","output":"Molecular and Physiological Effects of Magnesium-Polyphenolic Compound as Biostimulant in Drought Stress Mitigation in Tomato"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-invasive remote health monitoring plays a vital role in epidemiological situations such as SARS outbreak (2003), MERS (2015) and the recently ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 because it is extremely risky to get close to the patient due to the spread of contagious infections. Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes. Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications. IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution. The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating. This paper reviews recent advances in IR- UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonates health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging.

Methods: In this study, the patients required either non-invasive [oxygen 10 L/min or &gt;10 L/min through mask or nasal prongs, rebreather masks and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)] or invasive ventilation. For analysis of 30-day in hospital mortality in relation to use of different modes of oxygen, Kaplan Meier and log rank analyses were used. In the end, independent predictors of survival were determined by Cox regression analysis. Results: Invasive ventilation was required by 15.1% patients while 84.9% patients needed non-invasive ventilation. Patients with evidence of thromboembolism, high inflammatory markers and hypoxemia mainly required invasive ventilation. The 30-day in hospital mortality was 72.7% for the invasive group and 12.9% for the non-invasive group (1.8% oxygen &lt;10 L/min, 0.9% oxygen &gt;10 L/min, 3.6% rebreather mask and 4.5% BiPAP). The median time from hospital admission to outcome was 7 days for the invasive group and 18 days for the non-invasive group (P&lt;0.05).

Crises in the last decade which affected the Union and its citizens concerned, inter alia, public finance (the financial crisis, 2008), migration (2014), public health (the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020) and the rule of law crisis (2018). This paper focus on the latter. It has been noted that some Member States have been happy to receive the benefits of EU membership, specifically the financial ones, while their commitment to European values, including the rule of law (Article 2 TEU), has been lacking. Since many instruments applied by EU institutions to improve this situation have proved rather insufficient, halting transfers of EU funds to these recalcitrant Member States has been touted as the way that might solve this crisis. Accordingly, a draft regulation was put on the table that authorised the EU institutions to suspend EU funds if a Member State is found to be in breach of the rule of law. This draft aimed to make the transfer of EU funds to the Member States conditional upon their continuous respect for the rule of law (and therefore became known as the rule of law conditionality). This paper comments on this draft as first proposed by the Commission in 2018 (Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of the Union budget in the event of generalized gaps in the rule of law in the Member States [COM (2018) 324 final).], amended in 2019 by the European Parliament [European Parliament legislative resolution of 4 April 2019 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States (COM(2018)0324CC8-0178/2018C2018/0136(COD)); https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/seance_pleniere/textes_adoptes/provisoire/2019/04-04/0349/P8_TA-PROV(2019)0349_EN.pdf.

Methods: : Sixty-eight cases of suspected COVID-19 treated in Wenzhou Central Hospital from January 21 to February 20, 2020 were divided into confirmed and COVID-19-negative groups based on the results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid testing of the novel coronavirus in throat swab specimens to compare the clinical symptoms and laboratory and imaging results between the groups. Results: : Among suspected patients, 17 were confirmed to COVID-19-positive group and 51 were distinguished to COVID-19-negative group. Patients with reduced white blood cell (WBC) count were more common in the COVID-19-positive group than in the COVID-19-negative group (29.4% vs 3.9%, P = 0.003). Subsequently, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between WBC count and temperature in the COVID-19-positive patients (r=-0.587, P =0.003), instead of the COVID-19-negative group. But reduced lymphocyte count was no different between the two groups (47.1% vs 25.5%, P = 0.096).

Digital communication platforms (DCP) (e.g., Zoom?) were widely used to facilitate content delivery, yet little is known about DCP?s capacity or effectiveness, especially for simulation. Objective To compare the experience, outcomes, and resources required to implement a simulation-based communication skill curriculum on death notification to a cohort of learners using in-person vs. DCP delivery of the same content. Methods We used the GRIEV_ING mnemonic to train students in death notification techniques either in-person or utilizing a DCP. For all learners, three measures were collected: knowledge, confidence, and performance. Individual learners completed knowledge and confidence assessments pre and post-intervention. All performance assessments were completed by standardized patients (SPs) in real-time. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to identify differences in individual and between-group performances. Results Thirty-four learners participated (N=34), 22 in-person and 12 via DCP. There was a statistically significant improvement in both groups for all three measures: knowledge, confidence, and performance. Between-group comparisons revealed a difference in pre-test confidence but no differences between groups in knowledge or performance. More preparation and prior planning were required to set up the DCP environment than the in-person event. Conclusions The in-person and DCP delivery of death notification training were comparable in their ability to improve individual knowledge, confidence, and performance.

For those who had family members or relatives who died of COVID-19, the ratio was 5.592 (95% CI: [2.271, 13.766], p < 0.001), 459% higher than those who had no one who died. But the living places during the pandemic had no significant effect on PTSD. The findings suggest that mental health services reducing PTSD should be provided.

Even though we are witnessing the decline of the clinical autopsy, its importance remains unchanged as it is the most exhaustive way to investigate diseases. The identification of the virus in postmortem tissues is a fundamental step in the definition of its clinical features. Objective To investigate the presence of Sars-CoV-2 in the postmortem with swabs. Design We performed postmortem swabs in 12 autopsy cases of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Sars-CoV-2 related pneumonia. Our protocol, consisted of a rhino-pharingeal and a tracheal swab in order to search for the virus in the upper airways and of two swabs on the parenchyma of each lung. We also performed a fifth swab on the parenchyma of both lungs in order to search for other viruses that could evolve in a clinical picture of interstitial pneumonia Results Overall we found that 9 out of 12 cases had at least one postmortem swab to be positive for Sars-CoV-2. Moreover we evaluated the time lapse between the antemortem and the postmortem swabs, the time between death and the postmortem swabs, and the time lapse between the postmortem swabs and the acceptance to the microbiology laboratory. Interestingly we did not find a relation neither between the results of the swabs and the time lapsed from their collection, or with the time lapsed before their acceptance in the microbiology laboratory. Conclusions A thorough knowledge of the eventual persistence of pathogens in deaths related to infectious diseases is fundamental for the safety of the operators during the autopsy practice, especially when referring to emergent pathogens like Sars-Cov-2. Our study highlights the importance in performing multiple swabs in the postmortem, since Sars-CoV-2 swab positivity can be limited to only a single swab.","output":"Postmortem swabs in the Sars-CoV-2 Pandemic: Report on 12 complete clinical autopsy cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the U S , Black women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) are affected disproportionately by interpersonal violence, which often co-occurs with adverse mental health and/or substance use, and exacerbates existing poor HIV care outcomes Peer navigation has been successful in improving HIV care;however, HIV clinics often lack resources for sustainability and may not account for socio-structural barriers unique to Black WLHA To address this gap, we developed LinkPositively, a culturally-tailored, trauma-informed WebApp for Black WLHA affected by interpersonal violence to improve HIV care outcomes Using focus group data from nine Black WLHA and peer navigators, we developed LinkPositively Core components include: virtual peer navigation to facilitate skill-building to cope with barriers and navigate care;social networking platform for peer support;educational and self-care tips;GPS-enabled resource locator for HIV care and support service agencies;and medication self-monitoring/reminder system If efficacious, LinkPositively will shift the HIV prevention and care paradigm for Black WLHA","output":"LinkPositively: A Trauma-Informed Peer Navigation and Social Networking WebApp to Improve HIV Care among Black Women Affected by Interpersonal Violence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019C20 coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms, the general confinement of almost half of the world's population being a situation unprecedented in history, which is difficult today to measure the impact at the individual and collective levels. More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage C in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control C should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","output":"Informations relatives aux psychotropes et  leurs adaptations ventuelles pour les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques en France pendant lpidmie  SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analysed the Horizon 2020 project database, currently the European Unions (EU) largest framework programme for research and innovationnearly 80 billion euros available over 7 years (2014C2020), to estimate the amount and type of EU-supported biomedical and health research and funding distribution among EU member states and non-European countries.

METHODS The Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial is a randomized clinically controlled trial of 4104 smokers and previous smokers who were randomized to either screening with five annual low-dose CT scans or no screening in Copenhagen from 2004 to 2006. The major end point is the effect of CT screening on lung cancer mortality and treatment options. All diagnostic and treatment interventions in both groups were monitored prospectively until 1 to 3 years after the last screening round. RESULTS By February 1, 2011 68 cases of lung cancer were detected in the screening group. Furthermore, seven patients with a benign nodule underwent surgical treatment because of suspicion of malignancy (12%). Fifty-one of the 68 lung cancer patients were eligible for surgical treatment. Eight patients had open thoracotomy. Of the operations for lung cancer, 84% were performed by VATS in the CT-screened arm, significantly higher than the control arm (p < 0.05). Thirty-six patients had a VATS lobectomy. One patient had a VATS segmentectomy, and four patients had a VATS wedge resection. The seven benign nodules were all treated with VATS. CONCLUSIONS CT screening seems to facilitate the use of VATS in the treatment of lung cancer with an 84% rate in our data. Furthermore, all benign nodules could be removed by VATS. In our view, a basic requirement for a surgical institution to be involved in lung cancer CT screening is a dedicated VATS program.","output":"Lung cancer screening and video-assisted thoracic surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundOpioid overdoses in Canada have shown dramatic increases over recent years, despite significant investments in harm reduction. Most community monitoring currently relies on emergency department and coroner data. Our team has previously shown that paramedic data can be a useful addition to the current metrics as paramedics regularly interact with opioid overdose patients. This study examines paramedic data to investigate the changes to community opioid overdoses in the era of COVID-19 to better support our strategic partners in their battle against the opioid crisis.MethodsThe electronic ambulance call report database of Peterborough Paramedics (Ontario, Canada) was examined. De-identified records for patients from 2017-2020 with documented problem codes of Opioid Overdose were extracted. Patients receiving paramedic naloxone were also included. The data was cleaned and analysed, and incomplete records were removed. Statistical models including chi-squared tests of goodness-of-fit and post hoc pairwise t-tests were applied to the data. Ethics approval for this study was granted by the Trent Universitys Research Ethics Board.Results788 opioid overdoses were identified out of 72,737 patients. There were 263 opioid overdoses found in 2020 representing 1.4% patients, a significant increase from 2017-2019 (p value: 0.006). The proportion of patients receiving paramedic naloxone was significantly increased from previous years (p value: 0.005) while bystander naloxone administration was significantly decreased (p value 0.002). Age, gender, and pick-up location types were not significantly different between 2020 and previous years.ConclusionDespite reduced overall call volumes in 2020, paramedics observed an increase in opioid overdoses. The increase in paramedic naloxone administration and decrease in bystander naloxone administration may indicate changes in usage practices of community opioid users or an instability in the drug supply. These factors must be considered in future opioid harm reduction strategies and public health COVID-19 containment measures.","output":"Leveraging paramedic data to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on community opioid overdoses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on harmonized census data from 81 countries, we estimate how age and co-residence patterns shape the vulnerability of countries' populations to outbreaks of covid-19. We estimate variation in deaths arising due to a simulated random infection of 10% of the population living in private households and subsequent within-household transmission of the virus. The age-structures of European and North American countries increase their vulnerability to covid-related deaths in general. The co-residence patterns of elderly persons in Africa and parts of Asia increase these countries' vulnerability to deaths induced by within-household transmission of covid-19. Southern European countries, which have aged populations and relatively high levels of intergenerational co-residence are, all else equal, the most vulnerable to outbreaks of covid-19. In a second step, we estimate to what extent avoiding primary infections for specific age-groups would prevent subsequent deaths due to within-household transmission of the virus. Preventing primary infections among the elderly is the most effective in countries with small households and little intergenerational co-residence such as France, whereas confining younger age groups can have a greater impact in countries with large and inter-generational households such as Bangladesh.","output":"National age and co-residence patterns shape covid-19 vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An essential step for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection is the attachment to the host cell receptor by its Spike receptor\\\\binding domain (RBD).

Studies of CXR scoring in the European population found a higher score in males than in females and significantly correlated with age. Because there have not been studies in the Mexican-mestizo community, we aimed to compare the differences in CXR scores between males and females and their correlation with age after controlling comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 1000 CXR of Mexican-mestizo patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by RT-PCR. Significant differences between age, age groups, symptoms, comorbidities, and CXR scores between males and females used the MannCWhitney U, Chi-square tests ((2)), and KruskalCWallis tests. The relationship between the total CXR score and age was measured with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Rs); partial correlation analysis controlled the effect of symptoms, risk factors, and comorbidities. RESULTS: The total CXR score did not show a difference between males and females grouped by age. There was a positive, low correlation between the total CXR score and age in males, Rs = 0.260, p < 0.001 (N = 616), and in females, Rs = 0.170, p = 0.001 (N = 384).

Rs decreased its magnitude (from Rs = 0.152 to Rs = 0.046) and lost its significance (change in p value from p < 0.001 to p = 0.145) after controlling the effect of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in CXR score between males and females in the Mexican-mestizo population grouped by age. Hypertension cancels the significance of CXR severity with age pointing to its role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

Our study focuses on the impact of biomechanical changes in lungs that occur as individuals age, i.e., the stiffening of the lung parenchyma and increased matrix fiber density. We used hydrogels with an elastic modulus of 0.2 and 50 kPa and conventional tissue culture surfaces to investigate how infection rate changes with parenchymal tissue stiffness in lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein pseudotyped lentiviruses. Further, we employed electrospun fiber matrices to isolate the effect of matrix density. Given the recent data highlighting the importance of alternative virulent strains, we included both the native strain identified in early 2020 and an early S protein variant (D614G) that was shown to increase the viral infectivity markedly. Our results show that cells on softer and sparser scaffolds, closer resembling younger lungs, exhibit higher infection rates by the WT and D614G variant.

METHOD: After Research Ethics Board approval, elective surgical patients with normal airway predictors were randomly allocated 1:1 to tracheal intubation with or without a barrier enclosure. The primary outcome was time to tracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included first-pass success rate, total time of airway manipulation, anesthesiologists perception of intubation difficulty, likelihood of use in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, and patients perception of comfort and acceptability. RESULTS: There were 48 participants in the barrier enclosure group and 46 participants in the control group. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) time to tracheal intubation was 62 (29) sec with barrier closure and 53 (27) sec without barrier enclosure (mean difference, 9 sec; 95% confidence interval, ? 3 to 20; P = 0.14).

The diagnosis of syncope was based on European Society of Cardiology guidelines. A \\"Syncopal Fall\\" was defined in patients with an initial clinical presentation of unexplained fall, but a final diagnosis of syncope after complete assessment. A \\"Truly Unexplained Fall\\" was defined in patients with an initial clinical presentation of unexplained fall, in whom a diagnosis of syncope had been excluded after the diagnostic work-up.

METHODS: The present study investigated the leisure behavior of 285 one- to 10-year-old German children at two time points (t1 and t2) during the Covid-19-related lockdown in spring 2020. In the subsample of primary school children (n = 102), we also explored children's attitudes towards schoolwork at home. Analyses focused on the change of behavior from t1 to t2, on differences in these changes depending on socio-economic status (SES), and on associations of behavior with SES, the number of children at home, and the frequency of receiving learning materials from school. RESULTS: While the frequency of playing outside increased significantly from t1 to t2, the frequency of handicrafts, playing board games, indoor sports, and motivation to do schoolwork decreased. The observed changes between t1 and t2 did not differ depending on SES. However, a lower SES was associated with higher media use, less outdoor activity, and (though only marginally significant) a reduced time doing schoolwork and a reduced ability to concentrate on schoolwork at t1. In households with more children, children played outside more often, but were read to less frequently and (though only marginally significant) watched movies and series less frequently. Children receiving learning materials from school on a regular basis spent significantly more time doing schoolwork at home than children receiving materials only irregularly.

As a result, medical educators are placing more emphasis on patient-centered communication skills. However, few published curricula currently offer a comprehensive discussion of skills for providing patient-centered education (PCE), a key component of shared decision-making. We developed an interactive, two-session workshop aiming to improve students abilities to provide PCE. METHODS: Our workshop included didactic instruction, group discussion, and interactive simulations. The workshop was delivered to 50 clinical clerkship medical students. The first session concentrated on educating patients about their diagnoses, while the second session focused on providing patients with information about medications and other treatments. We used detailed and realistic role-play exercises as a core tool for student practice and demonstration of confidence. To evaluate the workshop, we used pre- and postsurveys. RESULTS: The sessions were well received by students, who strongly agreed both before and after the workshop that PCE was an important skill. Students also strongly agreed that the role-play exercises were an effective tool for learning PCE. They demonstrated significant improvements in their confidence to name important elements of PCE and to deliver PCE in the future. DISCUSSION: This workshop fills a curricular gap in offering a comprehensive and interactive curriculum for improving students abilities to provide critical PCE.

The newly discovered coronavirus, entitled SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh member of the human coronaviruses. The main pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, accompanied by glass turbidity, and acute cardiac injury. It possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which is 60-140 nm in diameter, and has a size of 26-32 kbp. Viral pathogenesis is accomplished with spike glycoprotein through the employment of a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, called the ACE2, as its primary cell receptor. It has been confirmed that various factors such as different national rules for quarantine and various races or genetic backgrounds might influence the mortality and infection rate of COVID-19 in the geographic areas. In addition to various known and unknown factors and host genetic susceptibility, mutations and genetic variabilities of the virus itself have a critical impact on variable clinical features of COVID-19. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it has a relatively high dynamic mutation rate with respect to other RNA viruses. It's noteworthy that, some mutations can be founder mutations and show specific geographic patterns. Undoubtedly, these mutations can drive viral genetic variability, and because of genotype-phenotype correlation, resulting in a virus with more/lower/no decrease in natural pathogenic fitness or on the other scenario, facilitating their rapid antigenic shifting to escape the host immunity and also inventing a drug resistance virus, so converting it to a more infectious or deadly virus. Overall, the detection of all mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and their relations with pathological changes is nearly impossible, mostly due to asymptomatic subjects. In this review paper, the reported mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and related variations in virus structure and pathogenicity in different geographic areas and genotypes are widely investigated. Many studies need to be repeated in other regions/locations for other people to confirm the findings. Such studies could benefit patient-specific therapy, according to genotyping patterns of SARS-CoV-2 distribution.","output":"Mutations in SARS-CoV-2; Consequences in structure, function, and pathogenicity of the virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Children with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may have a high early mortality when resources are limited by infrastructure or by a widespread worldwide crisis, as being faced with the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Many elective treatments were postponed, but newly diagnosed AML is a life-threatening disease that needs prompt therapy. With acute shortage of infra-structure as intensive care unit beds, blood supply, medication, healthcare personnel, an optimal therapy must balance anti-neoplastic efficacy and the chance of treatment-related mortality. The induction chemotherapy of pediatric patients with AML living in low- and middle-income countries has been thoroughly discussed because early mortality remains 10%-20%, much higher than in developed counties. Mild treatment schemas have been used in Japan, China and Latin America with impressive results, comparable to other intensive induction regimens. Our objective is to describe the results of this mild induction regimen used in Brazil to treat children simultaneously diagnosed with AML and Covid-19 infections. Methods: This is a retrospective multicentric trial including Brazilian children diagnosed with AML, also found to have a positive nasal and oropharyngeal PCR for SARS-Cov-2 and uniformly treated with mild induction protocol (MAG) that included Mitoxantrone at 5 mg/m2, by i.v. infusion over 4 to 6 hours once a day on days 1, 3, and 5 (three doses in total), Cytarabine at 10 mg/m2, subcutaneous (s.c.), q 12 h for 10 days (20 doses in total) and G-CSF 5 g/kg, s.c., once a day for 10 days (10 doses in total) [Bansal D, et al. Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Nov 27:e28087]. Results: From March 15 to July 1, 2020, nine children from four different institutions were diagnosed with AML (Table 1). Their median age was 9 years (range, 5 to 18), 6 female gender, all but one diagnosed with Covid-19 by nasal PCR; one had typical chest CT and positive IgM. The institutions had previously agreed on following the same induction when treating AML children infected by the SARS-Cov-2. Five of the nine had severe illness, three of them needed mechanical ventilation and one did not need supplementary oxygen despite radiologically diagnosed pneumonia. Two children had mild symptoms and two were completely asymptomatic. All children tolerated MAG chemotherapy. Neutropenia lasted for a median of 29 days (17-33) and none of them had neither thrombotic complications nor acute renal failure. All children recovered from the Covid-19 infection and 8 of 9 already evaluable children achieved complete remission of the leukemia with MRD 0-1% after the two planned cycles. All patients are alive, on therapy.

All evaluable patients achieved remission and are currently proceeding therapy. The high prevalence of Covid-19 in our country may have to be taken into account in all oncological treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of a double triage and telemedicine protocol in improving infection control in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited patients aged &#8805;20 years referred to the ED of the National Taiwan University Hospital between March 1 and April 30, 2020. A double triage and telemedicine protocol was developed to triage suggested COVID-19 cases and minimize health workers' exposure to this disease. We categorized patients attending video interviews into a telemedicine group and patients experiencing face-to-face interviews into a conventional group. A questionnaire was used to assess how patients perceived the quality of the interviews and their communication with physicians as well as perceptions of stress, discrimination, and privacy. Each question was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale. Physicians' total exposure time and total evaluation time were treated as primary outcomes, and the mean scores of the questions were treated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The final sample included 198 patients, including 93 cases (47.0%) in the telemedicine group and 105 cases (53.0%) in the conventional group. The total exposure time in the telemedicine group was significantly shorter than that in the conventional group (4.7 minutes vs 8.9 minutes, P<.001), whereas the total evaluation time in the telemedicine group was significantly longer than that in the conventional group (12.2 minutes vs 8.9 minutes, P<.001). After controlling for potential confounders, the total exposure time in the telemedicine group was 4.6 minutes shorter than that in the conventional group (95% CI -5.7 to -3.5, P<.001), whereas the total evaluation time in the telemedicine group was 2.8 minutes longer than that in the conventional group (95% CI -1.6 to -4.0, P<.001). The mean scores of the patient questionnaire were high in both groups (4.5/5 to 4.7/5 points).

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and osteoporosis often co-exist in older adults, and they present a major healthcare challenge. CKD mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) occurs as renal function declines and this syndrome affects most patients in CKD stages 4 and 5. The biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD, renal bone disease and risk factors associated with age-related bone loss and osteoporosis lead to a cumulative effect on fracture risk and mortality. There is a need for routine evaluation of fracture risk and fracture prevention in this population. Measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) and the use of the FRAX tool have predictive value for incident fractures in the general population and in CKD. This enables physicians to identify CKD patients most at risk of sustaining a fragility fracture and allows a more targeted approach to fracture prevention. Data analysis from the pivotal trials of therapeutic agents used in osteoporosis show that these drugs can be considered in mild and moderate CKD (stages 1-3 CKD). Off-label drug use in patients with CKD-MBD and more severe renal impairment (CKD stages 4 and 5) could offer significant benefits to sub-groups of patients when carefully tailored to each individual's bone turnover and calcium and phosphate balance. However, this requires a selective approach and treatment decisions based on inference from pathophysiology while we await further trials. Guidelines advocate the correction and/or reduction of the biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD before initiation of treatment with osteoporosis drugs and close monitoring during treatment.","output":"A review and perspective on the assessment, management and prevention of fragility fractures in patients with osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Proponents of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) claim patients have less pain, faster recovery, and better long-term cosmetic results than patients who undergo multiport laparoscopy. However, randomized comparisons are lacking. This study presents the results of a prospective randomized trial of SILS or 3-port laparoscopic appendectomy. STUDY DESIGN Adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis were randomized 1:1 to either SILS or 3-port laparoscopic appendectomy. The primary end point was early postoperative pain (measured by opiate usage and pain score in the first 12 hours). Secondary end points were operative time, complication rate (including conversions), and recovery time (days of oral opiate usage and return to work). After 6 months, body image and cosmetic appearance were assessed using a validated survey. RESULTS The trial was planned for 150 patients, but was halted after 75 patients when planned interim analysis showed that SILS patients had more postoperative pain (pain score: 4.4  1.6 vs 3.5  1.5; p = 0.01) and higher inpatient opiate usage (hydromorphone use: 3.9  1.9 mg vs 2.8  1.7 mg; p = 0.01) than 3-port laparoscopy. Operative time for SILS averaged 40% longer (54  17 minutes vs 38  11 minutes; p < 0.01). Only 1 SILS case was converted to 3-port. There were no significant differences in length of stay, complications, oral pain medication usage after discharge, or return to work. After 6 months, body image and cosmetic appearance were excellent for both groups and indistinguishable by most measures. However, 3-port patients reported better physical attractiveness (4.0  0.4 vs 3.8  0.4; p = 0.04) and SILS patients reported better scars (score 18.4  2.7 vs 16.4  3.0; p < 0.01).

However, the development of pharmacological strategies targeting osteoclasts to prevent periprosthetic osteolysis has not been fruitful. In this study, we worked toward researching the effects and mechanisms of a farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitor Lonafarnib (Lon) on receptor activator of nuclear factor B (NF-B) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, as well as the impacts of Lon on titanium particle-induced osteolysis. To investigate the impacts of Lon on bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis in vitro, bone marrow macrophages were incubated and stimulated with RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The influence of Lon on osteolysis prevention in vivo was examined utilizing a titanium particle-induced mouse calvarial osteolysis model. The osteoclast-relevant genes expression was explored by real-time quantitative PCR. Immunofluorescence was used to detect intracellular localization of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1). SiRNA silence assay was applied to examine the influence of FTase on osteoclasts activation. Related signaling pathways, including NFATc1 signaling, NF-B, mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways were identified by western blot assay. Lon was illustrated to suppress bone resorptive function and osteoclastogenesis in vitro, and it also reduced the production of pro-inflammatory substances and prevented titanium particle-induced osteolysis in vivo. Lon decreased the expression of osteoclast-relevant genes and suppressed NFATc1 nuclear translocation and auto-amplification. Mechanistically, Lon dampened FTase, and inhibition of FTase reduced osteoclast formation by suppressing ERK signaling. Lon is a promising treatment option for osteoclast-related osteolysis diseases including periprosthetic osteolysis by targeted inhibition of FTase through suppressing ERK signaling.","output":"Lonafarnib Inhibits Farnesyltransferase via Suppressing ERK Signaling Pathway to Prevent Osteoclastogenesis in Titanium Particle-Induced Osteolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an immense need to develop training on case recognition and management, with a focus on patients&#039;and health professionals&#039;safety at several levels of healthcare settings in Brazil Different simulation strategies can be included in the diverse clinical care phases for these patients OBJECTIVE: To suggest a complete simulation-based training program for Brazilian hospitals and/or academic institutions at this moment of the pandemic DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive analysis on possible simulated clinical cases using different methodologies, thereby supporting suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients METHODS: This was a reflective theoretical descriptive study on an educational program based on clinical simulation, with four practical phases at different performance and complexity levels Wearing, handling and adequately disposing of personal protective equipment, along with specific respiratory procedures in different healthcare settings up to intensive care for seriously infected patients were addressed RESULTS: This program was designed for application at different Brazilian healthcare levels through different clinical simulation strategies Summaries of expected performance were suggested in order to standardize technical capacity within these simulation settings, so as to serve these levels CONCLUSIONS: Developing training programs for situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic promotes safety not only for patients but also for healthcare workers In the present context, clear definition of which patients need hospital outpatient or inpatient care will avoid collapse of the Brazilian healthcare system Institutions that do not have simulated environments can, through the examples described, adopt procedures to promote didactic information in order to help healthcare professionals during this time","output":"Clinical simulation strategies for knowledge integration relating to initial critical recognition and management of COVID-19 for use within continuing education and health-related academia in Brazil: a descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevant personal protective measures during the COVID-19 pandemic include face masks, possibly decreasing the risk of infection among the general population and healthcare workers (HCW) if utilized properly.

METHODS The distance from the vertex of the bend to the tip (bend-to-tip distance) of seven brands of preformed oral and nasal ETTs were measured. Front teeth-to-carina (FTC) and nares-to-carina (NC) distance data from orally (0-19 years) and nasally (0-8 years) intubated children were used to assess the risk of endobronchial intubation if a preformed ETT had been placed with its bend at the front teeth or nares. RESULTS While the bend-to-tip distance of a cuffed oral preformed ETT only differed by 0-1 cm from a same size ETT from another brand, uncuffed oral ETTs differed by 0-4 cm. The bend-to-tip distance of cuffed and uncuffed ETTs of the same brand and size differed by 0-3 cm. Had preformed cuffed oral ETTs been placed with their bends at the front teeth in children of the FTC reference group, endobronchial intubation would have occurred in 0-27% of the patients, depending on the size and brand of the used ETT. In contrast to oral ETTs, the bend-to-tip distance of cuffed nasal ETTs differed more (0-5.5 cm) between brands, and uncuffed nasal ETTs less (0-3 cm). Also, the bend-to-tip distance of a cuffed nasal ETT was consistently greater (2-9 cm) than that of a same brand and size nasal uncuffed ETT. Had a preformed cuffed nasal ETT been placed with its bend at the nares in the NC reference group, 50-100% of the patients would have been endobronchially intubated. CONCLUSION The bend-to-tip distance of preformed ETTs varies between brands, especially for nasal tubes. Some preformed tubes are not well suited for routine use in children. There is a high risk for accidental endobronchial intubation if a cuffed preformed ETT is positioned with its bend at the front teeth or nares in a young child.

The aim of this mixed methods systematic review is to undertake a synthesis of qualitative and quantitative studies on GPs' knowledge, attitudes and experiences of managing BPSD. METHODS Seven electronic bibliographic databases will be searched from inception to present. All qualitative or quantitative studies that explore the knowledge, attitude or experiences of GPs towards the management of BPSD in community and/or residential settings will be eligible for inclusion. A meta-ethnography will be conducted to synthesise included studies. Primary outcome measures will include GPs' experiences of managing BPSD, GPs' knowledge of BPSD and their attitude to different approaches to the management of BPSD, in particular their attitude to non-pharmacological approaches. All included papers will be independently assessed for methodological validity by two reviewers using the following tools: the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for qualitative research, the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool for intervention studies and the National Institute of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for observational and analytical cross-sectional studies. As there is no agreed quality assessment tool for descriptive cross-sectional studies, an original tool will be developed.

In our study, we recruited a study cohort of 350 subjects comprising 248 COVID-19 patients (161 non-severe cases, 60 asymptomatic cases, and 27 severe cases) and 102 healthy controls (HCs), and herein present data with respect to their demographic features, urinary metabolome, immunological indices, and follow-up health status. We found that COVID-19 resulted in alterations of 39 urinary, mainly microbial, metabolites. Using random forest analysis, a simplified marker panel including three microbial metabolites (oxoglutaric acid, indoxyl, and phenylacetamide) was constructed (AUC=0.963, 95% CI, 0.930-0.983), which exhibited higher diagnostic performance than immune feature-based panels between COVID-19 and HC groups (P<0.0001). Meanwhile, we observed that urine metabolic markers enabled discriminating asymptomatic patients (ASY) from HCs (AUC = 0.981, 95% CI, 0.946-0.996), and predicting the incidence of high-risk sequalae in COVID-19 individuals (AUC=0.931, 95% CI, 0.877-0.966).

Materials: and Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective study including consecutive series of 198 eyes of 112 patients received bilateral same-day (concomitant) or unilateral anti-VEGF injections of bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept in the operating-room between January 2020 and January 2021. One-year medical record data including preference of bilateral over unilateral injection and adverse events were reviewed with 3-month intervals as before and after Covid-19 pandemic due to the labile Covid-19 outbreak course. Results: : A total of 504 injections with 234 concomitant bilateral (%46) were administered to 112 patients. The study group consisted of 58 neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD- 63.7% had bilateral nAMD), 46 diabetic macular edema (DME- 67.3% had bilateral DME) and 8 macular edema complicating retinal vein occlusion (RVO- 25% had bilateral RVO) patients. Of the injections, 156 (31%) were bevacizumab, 144 (29%) were aflibercept, and 204 (40%) were ranibizumab. The mean follow-up time per patient was 7.4  4.3 months (range 4-11 months) and the mean number of injections was 3.6  2.1 (range 2-10). None of the patients experienced serious vision-threatening complications or non-ocular adverse events. 85% of patients whose both eyes involved strongly preferred concomitant bilateral injection during Covid-19 pandemic while it was %35 before Covid-19 (P<0.001). The ratio of the number of concomitant bilateral injections to a total of injections increased from 30% to 57% after Covid-19 (P=0.03). Only 3 patients (2.6%) requested alternating unilateral injections after receiving the second concomitant bilateral injections. Conclusion: Concomitant bilateral injection approach was preferred by the majority of patients and did not increase the adverse event rate when applied under meticulous precautions;This intravitreal injection option may be preferred during still ongoing pandemic to reduce the clinical visits of patients at risk of Covid-19 related mortality due to their comorbidities and age.","output":"Concomitant Bilateral Intravitreal Injection of Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor: Experience in Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiplex PCR tests have improved our understanding of respiratory viruses epidemiology by allowing their wide range detection. We describe here the burden of these viruses in hospital settings over a five-year period. METHODS: All respiratory samples from adult patients (>20 years old) tested by multiplex-PCR at the request of physicians, from May 1 2011 to April 30 2016, were included retrospectively. Viral findings are reported by season, patient age group, respiratory tract region (upper or lower) and type of clinical unit (intensive care unit, pneumology unit, lung transplantation unit and other medical units). RESULTS: In total, 7196 samples (4958 patients) were included; 29.2% tested positive, with viral co-infections detected in 1.6% of samples. Overall, two viral groups accounted for 60.2% of all viruses identified: picornaviruses (rhinovirus or enterovirus, 34.3%) and influenza (26.6%). Influenza viruses constituted the group most frequently identified in winter (34.4%), in the upper respiratory tract (32%) and in patients over the age of 70 years (36.4%). Picornavirus was the second most frequently identified viral group in these populations and in all other groups, including lower respiratory tract infections (41.3%) or patients in intensive care units (37.6%). CONCLUSION: This study, the largest to date in Europe, provides a broad picture of the distribution of viruses over seasons, age groups, types of clinical unit and respiratory tract regions in the hospital setting. It highlights the burden associated with the neglected picornavirus group.

During this unprecedented time, many people pursued new hobbies in gardening, which proved to enhance physical and mental health. With anxieties regarding food insecurity, food gardens became a new urban trend. With a relatively tiny space available, it is possible to make an urban food garden in the front yard of a house using various cultivation techniques to maximize space. However, the implementation of food gardens in urban houses is quite challenging due to limited space. Then, we reflect on the practical process and personal benefits gained from developing a tiny food garden at home. The tiny food garden could produce a variety of vegetables and herbs, such as the spinach family, lettuce, Asian greens, the tomato family, eggplants, the basil family, mint, rosemary, moringas, and butterfly-pea flowers. It may support a household with few amounts of fresh emergency food in the worst scenario during the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides, developing a tiny food garden at home may also provide co-benefits such as enhanced subjective well-being, increased appreciation of food and the environment, motivating others to start gardening at home, and great personal satisfactions of consuming home-grown food.

Our secondary objectives were to determine the types of medications that the older adults are more likely to restrict and to determine the factors that influence these decisions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey experiment in which participants read 6 scenarios, each stating that they had a 3-day supply of a particular medication remaining. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: National Web-based survey distributed to 1457 U.S. adults aged 65 years and older by Dynata from March 25, 2020, to April 1, 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported whether they would go to a pharmacy, have a medication delivered, or restrict the use of each medication. They reported their perceptions and experiences with COVID-19, health risk factors, preferences for more or less care (medical maximizer-minimizer), medication attitudes (beliefs about medicines questionnaire), health literacy, prescription insurance status, and demographics. RESULTS: Most participants (84%) were told to shelter in place, but only 12% reported attempting to obtain extra medications. Participants most often reported that they would go to the pharmacy to obtain each medication (ranging from tramadol 48.9% to insulin 64.9%) except for zolpidem, which they were most likely to restrict (45.4%). Participants who reported comorbidities that increased their risk of COVID-19 were just as likely to go to the pharmacy as those without. In multinomial logistic regression analyses, women and the oldest participants were more likely to seek delivery of medications. Restricting medications was most common for 2 symptom-focused medications (tramadol and zolpidem), and both demographic factors (e.g., gender) and beliefs (e.g., medical maximizing-minimizing preferences) were associated with such decisions.

In this work, we aimed at testing whether clinical care changes imposed by the quarantine, together with certain demographic and disease-specific features, might have determined a self-perceived worsening of health status in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: A brief web-based questionnaire investigating self-perceived anxiety, depression, and motor worsening, as well as clinical care changes over COVID-19 emergency, was administered to ALS patients currently followed at San Martino Hospital. Ordinal and logistic regression analyses were applied to identify significant predictors of health status. RESULTS: Fifty-seven ALS patients completed the questionnaire. A total of 35.08% of cases reported anxiety symptoms, 36.84% depressive symptoms, and 35.08% reported worsening of motor symptoms. Significant predictors of anxiety symptoms severity included female gender, greater motor impairment, more aggressive disease course, and rehabilitation therapy suspension. The only significant predictor of depressive symptoms severity was a more aggressive disease course. Significant predictors of motor worsening were shorter disease duration and exams/visits cancelation.

As a result, there has been limited information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased cases in the region, as well as the impacts of different case management strategies. METHODS: Data from deceased cases reported across SSA through May 10, 2020 and from hospitalized cases in Burkina Faso through April 15, 2020 were analyzed. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information on deceased cases in SSA was derived through a line-list of publicly available information and, for cases in Burkina Faso, from aggregate records at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Tengandogo in Ouagadougou. A synthetic case population was derived probabilistically using distributions of age, sex, and underlying conditions from populations of West African countries to assess individual risk factors and treatment effect sizes. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the adjusted odds of survival for patients receiving oxygen therapy or convalescent plasma, based on therapeutic effectiveness observed for other respiratory illnesses. RESULTS: Across SSA, deceased cases for which demographic data are available have been predominantly male (63/103, 61.2%) and over 50 years of age (59/75, 78.7%). In Burkina Faso, specifically, the majority of deceased cases either did not seek care at all or were hospitalized for a single day (59.4%, 19/32); hypertension and diabetes were often reported as underlying conditions. After adjustment for sex, age, and underlying conditions in the synthetic case population, the odds of mortality for cases not receiving oxygen therapy was significantly higher than those receiving oxygen, such as due to disruptions to standard care (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.56 C 2.75). Cases receiving convalescent plasma had 50% reduced odds of mortality than those who did not (95% CI: 0.24 C 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Investment in sustainable production and maintenance of supplies for oxygen therapy, along with messaging around early and appropriate use for healthcare providers, caregivers, and patients could reduce COVID-19 deaths in SSA.

The worldwide incidence of asthma has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, over 300 million children and adults worldwide currently suffer from this incurable disease and 255,000 die from the disease each year. It is now well accepted that asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome and many clinical subtypes have been described. Viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) have been implicated in asthma exacerbation in children because of their ability to cause severe airway inflammation and wheezing. Infections with atypical bacteria also appear to play a role in the induction and exacerbation of asthma in both children and adults. Recent studies confirm the existence of an infectious asthma etiology mediated by Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and possibly by other viral, bacterial and fungal microbes. It is also likely that early-life infections with microbes such as CP could lead to alterations in the lung microbiome that significantly affect asthma risk and treatment outcomes. These infectious microbes may exacerbate the symptoms of established chronic asthma and may even contribute to the initial development of the clinical onset of the disease. It is now becoming more widely accepted that patterns of airway inflammation differ based on the trigger responsible for asthma initiation and exacerbation. Therefore, a better understanding of asthma subtypes is now being explored more aggressively, not only to decipher pathophysiologic mechanisms but also to select treatment and guide prognoses.

One promising intervention in the addictions employs personalized normative feedback to motivate change. Methods A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in which participants who used cannabis in a risky fashion were randomly assigned to one of two groups - those who received an online personalized feedback report in addition to educational materials about risky cannabis use and those who just received the online educational materials. Follow-up assessment occurred at three- and six-months post-randomization. Outcome variables included: number of days cannabis was used in the past 30, risky cannabis use (ASSIST score of four or more), and participant estimates of the proportion of cannabis users among those of the same age and gender. Results A total of 744 participants with risky cannabis use were recruited for the trial using online advertisements. There were no significant differences between intervention and educational materials only groups at three- and six-month follow-ups for the outcome variables, number of days used cannabis in the last 30 (p = 0.927) and proportion of participants engaging in risky cannabis use (p = 0.557).

As the number of total, confirmed COVID-19 cases approaches 7 million in the United States, it is estimated that there will be up to 500,000 new cases of chronically diminished smell. We offer a promising treatment. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The primary aim is to explore the main effects and interaction of bimodal visual-olfactory training and patient-preferred scents on olfactory training in patients with post-COVID-19 hyposmia or anosmia. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The study will utilize a 2x2 factorial design. The two effects we will explore are unimodal versus bimodal training and conventional versus patient-preferred odors. All 4 arms will undergo 12 weeks of olfactory training. Participants will be assessed pre and post-intervention. Measurements of olfactory function include the objective smell identification test and subjective measures including the Clinical Global Impression Scale and Olfactory Dysfunction Outcomes Rating. Individuals eligible for the study include men and women between 18 and 70 years of age with olfactory dysfunction of at least 3 months duration initially diagnosed within 2 weeks of a COVID-19 infection. Of note, we will enroll nationally. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We anticipate that the bimodal, patient-preferred scents training group will have the greatest improvement in smell scores, number of responders, and patient-reported sense of smell and health-related quality of life due to an additive interaction between the bimodal visual-olfactory and patient-preferred interventions. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The pathophysiology of COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction is mediated through damage to the peripheral and central olfactory pathways.

Multivariate analysis using restricted cubic spline curves showed the relationships between in-hospital mortality and age, male sex, increased body mass index, decreased Barthel Index for activities of daily living, comorbidities based on Charlson comorbidity index and its score. Findings: During the study period, 13503 of the patients admitted for COVID-19 completed hospital course. The overall in-hospital mortality was 41%, and 30% (393 of 13005) in the non-ventilated group and 315% (157 of 498) in the ventilated group. The age-specific in-hospital mortality was higher in the older age, with in-hospital mortality of 310% in aged 80 years and more in the early pandemic period of March 2020, and declined to 149% even in the second pandemic in August 2020. 13005 patients (963%) completed their course without mechanical ventilation and 498 patients (37%) with mechanical ventilation. The overall median age was 50 years (IQR 33C68). The milder the COVID-19, the younger the median age tended to be: median 44 years (IQR 29C59) without any respiratory support, median 69 years (IQR 55C80) in the supplemental oxygen group, and median 69 years (IQR 58C78) in the ventilated group. In the multivariate analysis, an older age, male sex, increased body mass index, increased Charlson Comorbidity Index score and decreased Barthel Index were associated with the risk of in-hospital mortality. Interpretation: The in-hospital mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Japan during the study period was considerably lower than that reported in previous studies using nationwide databases in other countries. This may reflect the low infection rate in Japan and the fact that the burden on medical resources did not exceed capacity. In the context of a pandemic, controlling the burden on medical resources is one of the important key factors for improving in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.

However, intravenously infused cells may be blocked in the lung, increasing the risk of vascular obstruction, which needs to be optimized to further improve safety and efficacy. METHODS: We derived small UCMSCs (S-UCMSCs) from filtering UCMSCs with a 10-m filter, and compared with UCMSCs by flow cytometry, directional differentiation culture and transcriptome sequencing. Then the S-UCMSCs and UCMSCs were intravenously infused in the Royal College Surgeons (RCS) rats to evaluate the safety and the efficacy. RESULTS: The diameter of S-UCMSCs ranged from 5.568 to 17.231 m, with an average diameter of 8.636  2.256 m, which was significantly smaller than that of UCMSCs. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and transcriptome sequencing demonstrated that the S-UCMSCs and UCMSCs were the same kind of MSCs, and the S-UCMSCs were more proliferative. After the S-UCMSCs and UCMSCs were intravenously infused into the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats at a dose of 1  10(6) cells/rat, the S-UCMSCs blocked in the lungs were significantly fewer and disappeared more quickly than UCMSCs. The b wave of the flash electroretinogram was improved at 7 d, and the retinal outer nuclear layer thickness was thicker at 7 d and 14 d. The expression level of inflammation was inhibited, and the expression level of neurotrophic factors was upregulated in the retina and serum after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: S-UCMSCs intravenous infusion was safer than UCMSCs and could delay retinal degeneration and protect visual function in RCS rats, which may be a preferable therapeutic approach for RP.

We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein.

One way to assess the relationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. There are several ways to perform such analyses, and we compare methods that utilize a PS metric together with a sliding window, referred to here as windowed phase synchronization (WPS), with those that directly measure the instantaneous phase synchronization (IPS). In particular, IPS has recently gained popularity as it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. In this paper, we discuss the underlying assumptions required for performing PS analyses and emphasize the importance of band-pass filtering the data to obtain valid results. Further, we contrast this approach with the use of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to achieve similar goals. We review various methods for evaluating PS and introduce a new approach within the IPS framework denoted the cosine of the relative phase (CRP). We contrast methods through a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results indicate that CRP outperforms other tested methods and overcomes issues related to undetected temporal transitions from positive to negative associations common in IPS analysis.

To date, up to 29 serotypes of BTV have been described, which are classified as classical (BTV 1C24) or atypical (serotypes 25C27), and its distribution has been expanding since 1998, with important outbreaks in the Mediterranean Basin and devastating incursions in Northern and Western Europe. Classical vaccine approaches, such as live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines, have been used as prophylactic measures to control BT through the years. However, these vaccine approaches fail to address important matters like vaccine safety profile, effectiveness, induction of a cross-protective immune response among serotypes, and implementation of a DIVA (differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals) strategy. In this context, a wide range of recombinant vaccine prototypes against BTV, ranging from subunit vaccines to recombinant viral vector vaccines, have been investigated.

INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for COVID-19 infection. There has been uncertainty about use of RAAS inhibitors in COVID-19. The association of RAAS inhibitors with severity of infection and clinical outcomes was addressed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study from Indian intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 138 were included, who were divided into group A (RAAS inhibitor) and group B (non-RAAS inhibitor). They are followed up till ICU stay during which peak levels of ferritin, D dimer, interleukin-6 were noted (primary outcome). The number of ventilator days, ICU length of stay, and ICU outcome also compared. RESULTS: Of 138 patients, 18 are included in group A and 120, in group B. There is no difference in peak levels (mean) D dimer [5,893 vs 7,710, p 0.46], ferritin [2,388 vs 3,635, p 0.56], interleukin-6 [9,597 vs 3,625, p 0.06]. There is no difference in number of ventilator days (2.2 vs 1.78, p 0.53) and ICU length of stay (6.5 vs 6.1, p 0.74). CONCLUSION: RAAS inhibitors can be safely continued in COVID-19 infection.

Methods: This observational longitudinal study was done on 33 consecutive medical interns during their Ophthalmology posting from December 2019 to March 2020 at a medical college in South-India. An AV-module was created using animation graphics, narratives, demonstrations on normal individuals and on patients with positive signs. All interns had a pretest consisting of Multiple-choice questions, (MCQs) and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) on torchlight examination and direct ophthalmoscopy (DO). They were then shown the 20-minute AV-module. A posttest was performed immediately and after one week. Results: The mean pretest MCQ score was 5.84  1.98. It improved to 8.81  1.15 in the immediate posttest and 8.87  1.66 in the one-week posttest. The mean pretest OSCE score was 12.21  3.39. It improved to 23.21  3.39 in the immediate posttest and 23.90  3.7 in the one-week posttest. Using Generalized Estimating Equation, MCQ score improved by 2.97 units and 3.03 units and the OSCE score improved by 11 units and 11.69 units in the immediate posttest and one-week posttest respectively when compared to the pretest corresponding to the MCQ score and OSCE score (p < 0.001). Conclusion: AV teaching modules-for torchlight examination and DO has a significant benefit in improving knowledge and skill in undergraduate medical students. These significant results have the great translatory capacity in the current COVID-19 pandemic, where physical demonstrations involving close proximity and groups of students are highly risk prone.","output":"A validated audio-visual educational module on examination skills in ophthalmology for undergraduate medical students in the COVID-19 season - An observational longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines 2018 for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (1, 2) provide comprehensive guidance for management of DKA in young people (Figure 1) Intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin remains the treatment of choice for treating DKA;however, the policy of many hospitals around the world requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for IV insulin infusion During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or other settings where intensive care resources are limited, ICU services may need to be prioritised or may not be appropriate due to risk of transmission of infection to young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes The aim of this guideline, which should be used in conjunction with the ISPAD 2018 guidelines(1) , is to ensure that young individuals with DKA receive management according to best evidence in the context of limited ICU resources Specifically, this guideline summarises evidence for the role of subcutaneous (SC) insulin in treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA in young people and may be implemented if administration of IV insulin is not an option The levels of evidence follow the American Diabetes Association (ADA) evidence-grading system for 'Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes' and are presented in Table 2 (3) This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved","output":"Diabetic ketoacidosis in the time of COVID-19 and resource-limited settings: role of subcutaneous insulin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o/Objetivo A pandemia por COVID-19 suscitou a importancia do cuidado com a propaga??o da resistncia antimicrobiana, sendo uma possvel responsvel por um aumento da dispensa??o de antimicrobianos, ou, associada ao distanciamento social, um fator para diminui??o do uso dessa classe de frmacos.

It is central to lung cancer, the leading cancer in terms of associated mortality that has affected millions of individuals worldwide. Inflammation and pulmonary manifestations are also the major causes of COVID-19 related deaths. Acute hyperinflammation plays an important role in the COVID-19 disease progression and severity, and development of protective immunity against the virus is greatly sought. Further, the severity of COVID-19 is greatly enhanced in lung cancer patients, probably due to the genes such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, PAI-1 and furin that are commonly involved in cancer progression as well as SAR-CoV-2 infection. The importance of inflammation in pulmonary manifestations, cancer and COVID-19 calls for a closer look at the underlying processes, particularly the associated increase in IL-6 and other cytokines, the dysregulation of immune cells and the coagulation pathway. Towards this end, several reports have identified epigenetic regulation of inflammation at different levels. Expression of several key inflammation-related cytokines, chemokines and other genes is affected by methylation and acetylation while non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs as well as long non-coding RNAs, also affect the overall inflammatory responses. Select miRNAs can regulate inflammation in COVID-19 infection, lung cancer as well as other inflammatory lung diseases, and can serve as epigenetic links that can be therapeutically targeted. Furthermore, epigenetic changes also mediate the environmental factors-induced inflammation. Therefore, a better understanding of epigenetic regulation of inflammation can potentially help develop novel strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat chronic pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and COVID-19.","output":"Epigenetic underpinnings of inflammation: Connecting the dots between pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The viscoelastic properties of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) make opportunities to construct novel compounds in many different fields. The interparticle forces of inorganic particles on colloidal NPs are important for forming a mechanically stable particulate network especially the NP-based soft matter in the self-assembly process. Here, by capping with the same surface ligand L-glutathione (GSH), two semiconductor NP (CdS and PbS) controlled biomimetic nanoparticle hydrogels were obtained, namely, CdS@GSH and PbS@GSH. The dependence of viscoelasticity of colloidal suspensions on NP sizes, concentrations, and pH value has been investigated. The results show that viscoelastic properties of CdS@GSH are stronger than those of PbS@GSH because of stronger surface bonding ability of inorganic particles and GSH. The hydrogels formed by the smaller NPs demonstrate the higher stiffness due to the drastic change of GSH configurations. Unlike the CdS@GSH hydrogel system, the changes of NP concentrations and pH value had great influence on the PbS@GSH hydrogel system. The higher the proportion of water in the small particle size PbS@GSH hydrogel system, the greater the mechanical properties. The stronger the alkalinity in the large particle size PbS@GSH hydrogel system, the greater the hardness and storage modulus. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicated that the ligand GSH forms surface layers with different thickness varying from different coordination modes which are induced by different semiconductor NPs. Moreover, increasing the pH value of the PbS@GSH hydrogel system will dissociate the surface GSH molecules to form Pb2+ and GSH complexes which could enhance the viscoelastic properties.","output":"Viscoelasticity Investigation of Semiconductor NP (CdS and PbS) Controlled Biomimetic Nanoparticle Hydrogels."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) The aim of the study is to assess the psychological burden of individuals with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to matched controls.

Methods: Consecutive adult patients with suspected COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department (Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, the Netherlands) from March 16th to April 16th were retrospectively included if they required hospital admission and underwent chest CT and RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The CO-RADS classification was used to assess the radiological probability of COVID-19, where a score of 1-2 was considered as negative, 3 as indeterminate, and 4-5 as positive. CT results were stratified by initial RT-PCR results. For patients with a negative RT-PCR but a positive CT, serology or multidisciplinary discussion after clinical follow-up constituted the final diagnosis. Results: 258 patients with suspected COVID-19 were admitted, of which 239 were included because they had both CT and RT-PCR testing upon admission. Overall, 112 patients (46.9%) had a positive initial RT-PCR, and 14 (5.9%) had a positive repeat RT-PCR. Of 127 patients with a negative or indeterminate initial RT-PCR, 38 (29.9% [95%CI 21.3-39.3%]) had a positive CT. Of these, 13 had a positive RT-PCR upon repeat testing, and 5 had positive serology.

This study evaluated the occurrence and outcome of AKI in CKD and non-CKD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 845 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection regarding the occurrence and outcome of AKI in a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)-designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from December 31, 2019, to March 20, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 845 COVID-19 patients, 91 had CKD and 754 had no CKD (non-CKD), of whom 22 and 14 developed AKI, respectively. Finally, 36 patients were included in the analysis. Older patients and those with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases were more likely to develop AKI. More CKD patients progressed to critical illness (72.73%) than non-CKD patients (57.14%), but the degree of AKI in CKD patients was lesser than that in non-CKD patients. Higher urea nitrogen, creatinine, and proteinuria levels were observed in CKD patients. More non-CKD patients were treated with human albumin than CKD patients. The survival probability of CKD patients was lower than that of non-CKD patients, but it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in the incidence rate of AKI after SARS-CoV-2 infection between CKD and non-CKD patients, and the clinical manifestations and treatments of AKI also differed. These results highlight the necessity of variable treatment methods for optimal clinical management.","output":"Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Have Higher Acute Kidney Injury Morbidity than those without after SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a global epidemic, and it is widely known that increased Body mass index (BMI) is associated with alterations in respiratory mechanics. Bariatric surgery is established as an effective treatment for this condition. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of different ventilation strategies in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials aimed at evaluating ventilation strategies for obese patients was carried out. Primary outcomes: in-hospital mortality, adequacy of gas exchange, and respiration mechanics alterations. RESULTS: Fourteen clinical trials with 574 participants were included. When recruitment maneuvers (RM) vs Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were compared, RM resulted in better oxygenation p = 0.03 (MD 79.93), higher plateau pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 7.30), higher mean airway pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 6.61), and higher compliance p < 0.00001 (MD 21.00); when comparing RM + Zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) vs RM + PEEP 5 or 10 cmH2O, RM associated with PEEP led to better oxygenation p = 0.001 (MD 167.00); when comparing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) 40 cmH2O + PEEP 10 cmH2O vs CPAP 40 cmH2O + PEEP 15 cmH2O, CPAP 40 + PEEP 15 achieved better gas exchange p = 0.003 (MD 36.00) and compliance p = 0.0003 (MD 3.00). CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that the alveolar recruitment maneuvers associated with PEEP lead to better oxygenation and higher compliance.

Due to the lack of specific therapeutic drugs and vaccines, the outbreak of disease has spawned a corpus of contagious infection all over the world, day by day, without control. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a very rapid infection rate, it is essential to develop a novel ameliorative and curative strategy as quickly as possible. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a type of adaptive immunity that has already been found to be effective in confronting several infectious diseases from the last two decades. For example, CP therapy was used in the treatment of viral-induced diseases like SARS-CoV epidemics, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pandemics, Ebola epidemics and H1N1 pandemic.

However, that is rarely feasible due to the constraints imposed by standardized measures of reading ability which require test administration by trained clinicians or researchers. Here we explore whether a simple, two-alternative forced choice, time limited lexical decision task (LDT), self-delivered through the web-browser, can serve as an accurate and reliable measure of reading ability. We found that performance on the LDT is highly correlated with scores on standardized measures of reading ability such as the Woodcock-Johnson Letter Word Identification test administered in the lab (r = 0.91, disattenuated r = 0.94). Importantly, the LDT reading ability measure is highly reliable (r = 0.97). After optimizing the list of words and pseudowords based on item response theory, we found that a short experiment with 76 trials (2-3 minutes) provides a reliable (r = 0.95) measure of reading ability. Thus, the self-administered, Rapid Online Assessment of Reading ability (ROAR) developed here overcomes the constraints of resource-intensive, in-person reading assessment, and provides an efficient and automated tool for effective online research into the mechanisms of reading (dis)ability.","output":"Measuring reading ability in the web-browser with a lexical decision task"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Timely identification of respiratory virus infection is essential to mitigate inappropriate antibiotic use and to implement appropriate treatment and/or infection control procedures. As such, multiplexed PCR assays have become standard in many virology laboratories. OBJECTIVES: To compare the Seeplex RV15 (test of record) with two newer generation multiplex assays, the Anyplex II RV16 and the xTAG respiratory virus panels. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred and three retrospective and 36 prospective respiratory samples were tested by all three assays. Samples were deemed to be positive if they tested positive for a virus by at least two of the three respective assays. Negative samples also had to test negative by at least two of the three assays. Inconclusive samples were those that showed band signal intensity between 0 and 100 on the RV15, but had not been previously tested on the RV16 or xTAG. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall sensitivity and specificity of all three assays were similar (85% and 100%, respectively). Given each assay can identify multiple different viruses, the targets reported by one assay did not always agree with each target from another assay. Partial discordant rates were 47% and 21% for positive and negative samples, respectively. These higher than expected partial discordant rates may be due to primer or chemistry differences amongst the three multiplex assays.","output":"Evaluation of three commercial multiplex assays for the detection of respiratory viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan demonstrated resilience at the initial stage of epidemic prevention, and effectively slowed down its spread. This study aims to document public epidemic awareness of COVID-19 in Taiwan through collecting social media- and Internet-based data, and provide valuable experience of Taiwan's response to COVID-19, involving citizens, news media, and the government, to aid the public in overcoming COVID-19, or infectious diseases that may emerge in the future. The volume of Google searches related to COVID-19 and face masks was regarded as an indicator of public epidemic awareness in the study. A time-series analysis was used to explore the relationships among public epidemic awareness and other COVID-19 relevant variables, which were collected based on big data analysis. Additionally, the content analysis was adopted to analyze the transmission of different types of fear information related to COVID-19 and their effects on the public. Our results indicate that public epidemic awareness was significantly correlated with the number of confirmed cases in Taiwan and the number of news reports on COVID-19 (correlation coefficient: .33-.56). Additionally, the findings from the content analysis suggested that the fear of the loss of control best explains why panic behavior occurs among the public. When confronting the highly infectious COVID-19, public epidemic awareness is vital. While fear is an inevitable result when an emerging infectious disease occurs, the government can convert resistance into assistance by understanding why fear arises and which fear factors cause excessive public panic. Moreover, in the digitalization era, online and social media activities could reflect public epidemic awareness that can e harnessed for epidemic control.","output":"Evolving public behavior and attitudes towards COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan: A social media study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because increasing numbers of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from adult patients with acute respiratory illness (ARI) are being tested by respiratory virus (RV) multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR (RVM-RT-PCR), multiple RV detection (MRVD) is being encountered more frequently. However, the clinical relevance of MRVD in adult patients has rarely been evaluated. The clinical characteristics of hospitalized adult patients with ARI and MRVD by RVM-RT-PCR tests were compared to those of patients with single RV detection (SRVD) during a single year at a tertiary care center. MRVD was observed in 26 of the 190 adult patients (13.7%). The patients with MRVD had a higher incidence of chronic lung disease than the patients with SRVD (34.6% versus 15.9%, crude odds ratio [OR]=2.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.13 to 6.98, P=0.03). Although the former were more likely than the latter to receive mechanical ventilation (19.2% versus 6.7%, crude OR=3.31, 95% CI=1.05 to 10.47, P=0.049), the length of hospital stay (median, 7 versus 6.5 days; P=0.66), and the in-hospital mortality rate (7.7% versus 4.3%, crude OR=1.87, 95% CI=0.37 to 9.53, P=0.35) were not different between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, chronic lung disease was associated with MRVD (adjusted OR=3.08, 95% CI=1.12 to 8.46, P=0.03). In summary, it was not uncommon to encounter adult patients with ARI and MRVD by RVM-RT-PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

The benefit of critical care in these patients remains unclear. We compared outcomes in elderly versus very elderly subjects receiving mechanical ventilation. METHODS: In total, 5,557 mechanically ventilated subjects were included in our post hoc retrospective analysis, a subgroup of the VENTILA study. We divided the cohort into 2 subgroups on the basis of age: very elderly subjects (age  80 y; n = 1,430), and elderly subjects (age 65-79 y; n = 4,127). A propensity score on being very elderly was calculated. Evaluation of associations with 28-d mortality was done with logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Very elderly subjects were clinically sicker as expressed by higher SAPS II scores (53  18 vs 50  18, P < .001), and their rates of plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O were higher, whereas other parameters did not differ. The 28-d mortality was higher in very elderly subjects (42% vs 34%, P < .001) and remained unchanged after propensity score adjustment (adjusted odds ratio 1.31 [95% CI 1.16-1.49], P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Age was an independent and unchangeable risk factor for death in mechanically ventilated subjects. However, survival rates of very elderly subjects were > 50%.

The aim of this study is to identify high-risk phenotypes of diabetes associated with COVID-19 severity and death. METHODS: This is the first edition of a living systematic review and meta-analysis on observational studies investigating phenotypes in individuals with diabetes and COVID-19-related death and severity. Four different databases were searched up to 10 October 2020. We used a random effects meta-analysis to calculate summary relative risks (SRR) with 95% CI. The certainty of evidence was evaluated by the GRADE tool. RESULTS: A total of 22 articles, including 17,687 individuals, met our inclusion criteria. For COVID-19-related death among individuals with diabetes and COVID-19, there was high to moderate certainty of evidence for associations (SRR [95% CI]) between male sex (1.28 [1.02, 1.61], n = 10 studies), older age (>65 years: 3.49 [1.82, 6.69], n = 6 studies), pre-existing comorbidities (cardiovascular disease: 1.56 [1.09, 2.24], n = 8 studies; chronic kidney disease: 1.93 [1.28, 2.90], n = 6 studies; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 1.40 [1.21, 1.62], n = 5 studies), diabetes treatment (insulin use: 1.75 [1.01, 3.03], n = 5 studies; metformin use: 0.50 [0.28, 0.90], n = 4 studies) and blood glucose at admission (11 mmol/l: 8.60 [2.25, 32.83], n = 2 studies).

Here, we examined the pathogenicity of a TW-like IBV strain (GD), and evaluated the protective efficacy of the QX-like strain (JS) against GD in challenge infections in chickens. The results revealed that strain-GD-infected birds experienced severe respiratory signs, renal lesions, and 30C40% mortality. The GD virus had extensive tissue tropism, especially in the trachea, lungs, kidneys, and bursa of Fabricius, and was continuously shed via the respiratory tract and cloaca. The QX-like IBV strain JS is able to completely protect chickens from challenge with the TW-like IBV GD field strain, with no clinical signs or gross lesions, decreased tissue replication rates, lower ciliostasis score, and reduced virus shedding. These findings indicate that IBV GD is highly virulent, and that QX-like JS may serve as an effective vaccine against the threat posed by IBV TW-like viruses.","output":"Pathogenicity of a TW-Like Strain of Infectious Bronchitis Virus and Evaluation of the Protection Induced against It by a QX-Like Strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology\\\\delivered psychological interventions, particularly online and telephonic counselling, have flourished in recent years, with the need for such a flexible delivery method increasing due to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

We compared the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of medical abortion before and after the service model change. Methods: Data were analysed from the three main abortion providers in England and Wales. We defined two cohorts, each including all medical abortions performed over a two month period before and after the service model change: traditional, where care was in-person and included an ultrasound scan, and telemedicine-hybrid where medical abortions were provided either by no-test telemedicine or in-person if indicated. Findings: We analysed outcomes for 52,142 medical abortions;22,158 in the traditional cohort and 29,984 in the telemedicine-hybrid cohort of which 61% were no-test telemedicine. The cohorts accounted for 85% of all medical abortions reported in England and Wales. Mean waiting times were 4.2 days shorter in the telemedicine-hybrid cohort;40% were provided at 6 weeks gestation compared to 25% in the traditional cohort (p<0.001). There was no difference in success rates in either group (98.2% vs. 98.8%, p=1.0), nor in the prevalence of serious adverse events (0.04% vs. 0.02%, p=0.557). The incidence of ectopic pregnancy was equivalent in both cohorts (0.2%, p=0.796). In 0.04% of cases the abortion appeared to have been provided at over 10 weeks gestation;these abortions were all completed at home without additional medical complications. In the telemedicine-hybrid group, the effectiveness for abortions conducted using telemedicine (n=18,435) was higher than for those conducted in-person (n=11,549), 99.2% vs. 98.1%, p<0.001. Acceptability was high (96% satisfied) and 80% reported a future preference for telemedicine.

Excision biopsy is generally recommended for clinically suspicious pigmented lesions; however, a proportion of cutaneous melanomas are diagnosed by shave biopsy. A systematic review was undertaken to investigate the impact of shave biopsy on tumor staging, treatment recommendations, and prognosis. METHODOLOGY: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles. Data on deep margin status on shave biopsy, tumor upstaging, and additional treatments on wide local excision (WLE), disease recurrence, and survival effect were analyzed across studies. RESULTS: Fourteen articles from 2010 to 2020 were included. In total, 3713 patients had melanoma diagnosed on shave biopsy. Meta-analysis revealed a positive deep margin in 42.9% of shave biopsies. Following WLE, change in tumor stage was reported in 7.7% of patients. Additional treatment was recommended for 2.3% of patients in the form of either further WLE and/or sentinel lymph node biopsy. There was high heterogeneity across studies in all outcomes. Four studies reported survival, while no studies found any significant difference in disease-free or overall survival between shave biopsy and other biopsy modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Just over 40% of melanomas diagnosed on shave biopsy report a positive deep margin; however, this translated into a change in tumor stage or treatment recommendations in relatively few patients (7.7% and 2.3%, respectively), with no impact on local recurrence or survival among the studies analyzed.","output":"Impact of Shave Biopsy on Diagnosis and Management of Cutaneous Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rise of Covid-19 raised several concerns for the educational policymakers and stakeholders all over the world, including Pakistan.

While contact tracing and case investigation have been carefully designed to protect privacy, the huge volume of tracing which is being carried out as part of the pandemic response in the United States is highlighting potential concerns around privacy, legality, and equity. Contact tracing during the pandemic has gained particular attention for the new use of digital technologies-both on the consumer side in the form of Exposure Notification applications, and for public health agencies as digital case management software systems enable massive scaling of operations. While the consumer application side of digital innovation has dominated the news and academic discourse around privacy, people are likely to interact more intensively with public health agencies and their use of digital case management systems. Effective use of digital case management for contact tracing requires revisiting the existing legal frameworks, privacy protections, and security practices for management of sensitive health data. The scale of these tools and demands of an unprecedented pandemic response are introducing new risks through the collection of huge volumes of data, and expanding requirements for more adept data sharing among jurisdictions. Public health agencies must strengthen their best practices for data collection and protection even in the absence of comprehensive or clear guidance.

We excluded infants who died within 60 days of life without intervention from the main analyses of timing of transfer, since intervention may not have been planned in these infants. Of 556 cases, 107 died without intervention (19%) and another 52 (9%) died within 28 days. Of the 449 included in analyses of timing of transfer, 28% were born at the destination hospital, 49% were transferred early, and 23% were transferred late. Late transfer was more likely for infants of low birthweight (RR 1.74) and infants born to US-born Hispanic (RR 1.69) and black (RR 2.45) mothers. Low birthweight (HR 1.50), low 5-min Apgar score (HR 4.69), and the presence of other major congenital anomalies (HR 3.41), but not timing of transfer, predicted neonatal mortality. Late transfer was more likely in neonates born to US-born Hispanic and black mothers but was not associated with higher mortality.

Methods: Chest CT of 34 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by the nucleic acid test (NAT) were retrospectively analyzed. Analyses were performed to investigate the pathological basis of four imaging features(feather sign,dandelion sign,pomegranate sign, and rime sign) and to summarize the follow-up results. Results: There were 22 patients (65.2 %) with typical feather signand 18 (52.9%) with dandelion sign, while few patients had pomegranate sign and rime sign. The feather sign and dandelion sign were composed of stripe or round ground-glass opacity(GGO), thickened blood vessels, and small-thickened interlobular septa. The pomegranate sign was characterized as follows: the increased range of GGO, the significant thickening of the interlobular septum, complicated with a small amount of punctate alveolar hemorrhage. The rime sign was characterized by numerous alveolar edemas. Microscopically, the wall thickening, small vascular proliferation, luminal stenosis, and occlusion, accompanied by interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as numerous pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and partial hyaline degeneration were observed. Repeated chest CT revealed the mediastinal lymphadenectasis in one patient. Re-examination of the NAT showed another positive anal swab in two patients. Conclusion: Feather sign and dandelion sign were typical chest CT features in patients with COVID-19;pomegranate sign was an atypical feature, and rime sign was a severe feature. In clinical work, accurate identification of various chest CT signs can help to improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 and reduce the misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis rate.","output":"Analysis of 4 imaging features in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Many countries have drawn their attention on developing Corona virus disease 2019 vaccine however there is less emphasis on whether this vaccine could be accepted in most of these countries. This study aimed to investigate acceptance and risk perception of COVID-19 vaccine in Uganda. Method: A simplified snowball sampling technique was used to select 1067 respondents of 18-70 years in western Uganda using an online questionnaire from July to September 2020. Vaccine acceptability and risk perception was assessed using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval using R software version 3.6.3. Results: : The acceptance rate for vaccination against COVID-19 was (53.6%;572/1067) with participants in the reference age group 18-20 (OR: 1;95%CI: NA);males (OR: 2.1;95%CI: 1.56-2.71;P =0.000);tertiary level of education (OR: 2.8;95%CI: 1.25-6.11;P =0.009);students (OR: 3.19;95%CI: 1.98-5.15;P =0.000) and non-salary earners (OR: 2.29;95%CI: 1.53-3.44;P =0.000) significantly more likely to accept the vaccine. Results also showed that (46.4%;495/1067) of the respondents were un-likely to accept the vaccine. About (44.6%;476/1067) of the respondents were likely to accept vaccine clinical trials with participants in the reference age group 18-20 (OR: 1;95%CI: NA), students (OR: 2.37;95%CI: 1.49-3.77;P =0.000), marrieds (OR: 1.3;95%CI: 1.03-1.69;P =0.028), and non-salary (OR: 1.56;95%CI: 1.05-2.30;P =0.029) significantly more likely to accept clinical trials. There were (46.7%;500/1067) of the respondents who perceived the vaccine as being risky with males (OR: 3.13;95%CI: 2.33-4.21;P =0.000);students (OR: 2.59;95%CI: 1.63-4.13;P =0.000);Civil servants (OR: 1.49;95%CI: 0.98-2.25;P =0.063);and non-salary earners;(OR: 2.34;95%CI: 1.57-3.47;P =0.000) who significantly perceived the vaccine as being more risky. Conclusion: The level of vaccine acceptance (53.6%) and risk perception (46.7%) was relatively average in western Uganda. In order to ensure successful vaccination process, the government needs to prioritize vaccine acceptance strategies especially among the risky group in the community.","output":"Acceptance and Risk Perception of COVID-19 Vaccine in Uganda: A Cross Sectional Study in Western Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Women and children bear a substantial burden of the impact of conflict and instability. The number of people living in humanitarian and fragile settings (HFS) has increased significantly over the last decade. The provision of essential maternal and newborn healthcare by midwives is crucial everywhere, especially in HFS. There is limited knowledge about the interventions, support systems and enabling environments that enhance midwifery care in these settings. The aim of this paper is to identify the factors affecting an enabling environment for midwives in HFS and to explore the availability and effectiveness of support systems for midwives. METHODS: A structured systematic review was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed primary research articles published between 1995 and 2020. RESULTS: In total, 24 papers were included from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Uganda and Liberia. There were two broad themes: (1) the facilitators of, and barriers to, an enabling environment, and (2) the importance of effective support systems for midwives. Facilitators were: community involvement and engagement and an adequate salary, incentives or benefits. Barriers included: security and safety concerns, culture and gender norms and a lack of infrastructure and supplies. Support systems were: education, professional development, supportive supervision, mentorship and workforce planning. CONCLUSION: More efforts are needed to develop and implement quality midwifery services in HFS. There is an urgent need for more action and financing to ensure better outcomes and experiences for all women, girls and families living in these settings.
