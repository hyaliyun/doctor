We aimed to examine whether aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) volumes demonstrated similar declines in our department. Furthermore, the impact of the pandemic on disease progression should be analyzed. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in the neurosurgical department of the university hospital Frankfurt including patients with the diagnosis of aSAH during the first year of the COVID pandemic. One year cumulative volume for aSAH hospitalization procedures was compared to the year before (03/2020 C 02/2021 vs. 03/2019 C 02/2020) and the last 5 pre-COVID-pandemic years (2015-2020). All relevant patient characteristics concerning family history, disease history, clinical condition at admission, active/past COVID-infection, treatment management, complications, and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to the 84 hospital admissions during the pre-pandemic years, the number of aSAH hospitalizations (n = 56) declined during the pandemic without reaching significance. No significant difference in the analyzed patient characteristics including clinical condition at onset, treatment, complications, and outcome, between 56 patients with aSAH admitted during the COVID pandemic and the treated patients in the last 5 years in the pre-COVID period were found. In our multivariable analysis, we detected young age (p < 0.05; OR 4.2) and no existence of early hydrocephalus (p < 0.05; OR 0.13) as important factors for a favorable outcome (mRS  0C2) after aSAH during the COVID pandemic. A past COVID-infection was detected in young patients suffering from aSAH (Age <50years, p < 0.05; OR 10.5) with an increased rate of cerebral vasospasm after aSAH onset (p < 0.05; OR 26). Nevertheless, past COVID-infection did not reach significance as a high-risk factor for unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: There was a relative decrease in the number of patients with aSAH during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the extremely different conditions of hospitalization, there was no impairing significant effect on the treatment and outcome of admitted patients with aSAH. A past COVID infection seemed to be an irrelevant limiting factor concerning favorable outcomes.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Treatment Management and Clinical Outcome of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage C A Single-Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacteria of the genus Psychrobacter are known for their psychrophilic characteristics, being extremophilic organisms capable of surviving and reproducing in hostile environments of low temperature and high pressure. Among many of the genus characteristics, there is the ability to produce enzymes and molecules of industrial biotechnology importance, such as pigments and proteins related to heavy metal bioremediation. The bacterium strain Psychrobacter nivimaris LAMA 639 was isolated from sediments from the Walvis Ridge ocean crest at a depth of 4.400 m (33.40 S 2.35 E). It is a nonmotile, halotolerant, cream-colored gram-negative aerobic bacterium. Its cultivation was performed in marine agar plates and inoculated into test tubes with NaCl at an optimal temperature of 30 C and with shaking at 100 rpm. Genome extraction was performed with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN?). Sequencing was performed by Macrogen using the NovaSeq? 6000 platform (Illumina) applying the whole genome shotgun (WGS) method. Thereafter, 14.712.526 reads of 151 bp were generated, totaling 2.2 G bp with a GC content of 42.9%. Assembly and mapping were performed with a CLC Genomics Workbench. The best assembly considered was the one with the lowest number of contigs and the highest base length pair. The assemblies were evaluated using QUAST, and the best resulting variant was selected for annotation. Genome annotation was performed with RAST and PATRIC; the antiSMASH tool was used for secondary metabolites; NaPDoS was used for domains; and three-dimensional structural prediction of relevant proteins was performed using Phyre2. Annotation with ClassicRAST generated 2,891 coding sequences (CDSs) distributed in 402 subsystems. Annotation with PATRIC generated 2,896 coding sequences, among them 776 hypothetical proteins. The antiSMASH tool visualized a beta-lactone cluster in contig 06. In the search for natural products with NaPDoS, two ketosynthase domains were identified. The search for relevant proteins was performed using the AMFEP list as a criterion. From these data, 34 possible enzymes with biotechnological potential were found. Finally, the organism is presented as a new reference regarding the potential of deep-sea marine bacteria, demonstrating that, from the annotated and cured genome, it is possible to find in its genetic repertory products of interest for biotechnological applications.","output":"Draft genome sequence of Psychrobacter nivimaris LAMA 639 and its biotechnological potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike (S) protein of the recently emerged human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) mediates infection by binding to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).

Our aim, therefore, is to present a protocol that uses rigorous selection criteria, to distinguish high quality case reports/studies and case series for inclusion in systematic reviews. Methods: This protocol will adapt the existing Navigation Guide methodology for specific inclusion of case studies. The usual procedure for systematic reviews will be followed. Case reports/studies and case series will be specified in the search strategy and included in separate sections. Data from these sources will be extracted and where possible, quantitatively synthesized. Criteria for integrating cases reports/studies and case series into the overall body of evidence are that these studies will need to be well-documented, scientifically rigorous, and follow ethical practices. The instructions and standards for evaluating risk of bias will be based on the Navigation Guide. The risk of bias, quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations will be assessed by two independent review teams that are blinded to each other.

Following LDG, Billroth-I (B-I) provides physiological reconstruction by preserving the duodenal passage but results in a high incidence of reflux esophagitis that decreases postoperative quality of life. Because of this, Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstruction is often considered the first choice after LDG. However, very few studies have investigated differences in physiological function between B-I and R-Y after LDG. We hypothesized that B-I would outperform R-Y in clinical and physiological outcomes, including nutrition parameters. METHODS We compared hemoglobin, ferritin, serum iron, Vitamin B12, 25(OH)-Vitamin D (V-D), body weight, and gastric emptying after LDG in patients with either B-I or R-Y reconstruction. RESULTS The levels of hemoglobin in the B-I group were significantly higher than that in the R-Y group at all time points later than 6 months postsurgery. The ferritin levels were significantly higher in the B-I group at all time points later than 9 months postsurgery. The concentration of serum V-D in the B-I group was significantly higher than that in the R-Y group at 1 year 6 months, 1 year 9 months, and 2 years after surgery. Gastric emptying in the R-Y group was significantly slower than in the B-I group. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that B-I leads to less postsurgical iron deficiency anemia and V-D deficiency compared with R-Y reconstruction. Furthermore, gastric emptying was preserved in B-I reconstruction compared with R-Y reconstruction. In conclusion, after LDG, B-I reconstruction seems to cause fewer nutritional complications than R-Y reconstruction.","output":"Comparison of the Physiological Effect of Billroth-I and Roux-en-Y Reconstruction Following Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All coronaviruses (CoVs) contain a macrodomain, also termed Mac1, in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) which binds and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) covalently attached to proteins. Despite several reports demonstrating that Mac1 is a prominent virulence factor, there is still a limited understanding of its cellular roles during infection. Currently, most of the information regarding the role of CoV Mac1 during infection is based on a single point mutation of a highly conserved asparagine residue, which makes contact with the distal ribose of ADP-ribose. To determine if additional Mac1 activities contribute to CoV replication, we compared the replication of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) Mac1 mutants, D1329A and N1465A, to the previously mentioned asparagine mutant, N1347A. These residues contact the adenine and proximal ribose in ADP-ribose, respectively. N1465A had no effect on MHV replication or pathogenesis, while D1329A and N1347A both replicated poorly in bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), were inhibited by PARP enzymes, and were highly attenuated in vivo Interestingly, D1329A was also significantly more attenuated than N1347A in all cell lines tested. Conversely, D1329A retained some ability to block IFN-? transcript accumulation compared to N1347A, indicating that these mutations have different effects on Mac1 functions. Combining these two mutations resulted in a virus that was unrecoverable, suggesting that the combined activities of Mac1 may be essential for MHV replication. We conclude that Mac1 has multiple functions that promote the replication of MHV, and that these results provide further evidence that Mac1 could be a prominent target for anti-CoV therapeutics.IMPORTANCEIn the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been a surge to better understand how CoVs replicate, and to identify potential therapeutic targets that could mitigate disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other prominent CoVs. The highly conserved macrodomain, also termed Mac1, is a small domain within non-structural protein 3. It has received significant attention as a potential drug target as previous studies demonstrated that it is essential for CoV pathogenesis in multiple animal models of infection. However, the functions of Mac1 during infection remain largely unknown. Here, using targeted mutations in different regions of Mac1, we found that Mac1 has multiple functions that promote the replication of MHV, a model CoV, and therefore is more important for MHV replication than previously appreciated. These results will help guide the discovery of these novel functions of Mac1 and the development of inhibitory compounds targeting this domain.","output":"Unique mutations in the MHV macrodomain differentially attenuate virus replication, indicating multiple roles for the macrodomain in coronavirus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Arizona, the expansion and elaboration of neoliberal educational policies over the past three decades in Arizona have placed public schools and the teaching profession in precarious positions.

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared CEA to CAS in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. These studies have suggested that CAS is more strongly associated with periprocedural stroke; however, CEA is more strongly associated with myocardial infarction. Published long-term outcomes report that CAS and CEA are similar. A reduction in complications associated with CAS has also been demonstrated over time. The symptomatic status of the patient and history of previous CEA or cervical radiotherapy are significant factors when deciding between CEA or CAS. Numerous carotid artery stents are available, varying in material, shape and design but with minimal evidence comparing stent types. The role of cerebral protection devices is unclear. Dual antiplatelet therapy is typically prescribed to prevent in-stent thrombosis, and however, evidence comparing periprocedural and postprocedural antiplatelet therapy is scarce, resulting in inconsistent guidelines. Several RCTs are underway that will aim to clarify some of these uncertainties.

A method for measuring levels of active enzymes that can be carried out quickly would ensure that feed has been supplemented with the appropriate amount of enzyme. Phytase is the most widely used feed enzyme and is routinely quantified with an activity assay in a limited number of specialized laboratories. As an alternative, we report here the development of a rapid and easy method to perform a quantitative assay for the phytase from Citrobacter braakii. The method is suitable for use at local sites with a minimum lab setup and will reduce delays and potential interferences due to improper sample storage and shipment. The new assay is based on a lateral flow immunoassay that utilizes magnetic immune-chromatographic test (MICT) technology to quantify the phytase content of a feed extract. After extraction of the phytase from the feed, the sample is simply diluted and added to a reaction tube containing a specific anti-phytase antibody coupled to superparamagnetic particles. The mixture is then applied on an assay cassette, where the formed particle-antibody-phytase complexes are captured by immobilized antibodies on a nitro-cellulose strip housed in a cassette. The cassette is placed in the MICT reader that measures the magnetic signal of the captured particles. Using the calibration information stored in the cassette barcode, the signal is converted to a phytase concentration, given as phytase activity (FYT) per kilogram of feed. The accuracy and robustness of the assay compared to the ISO phytase activity assay were demonstrated through a large validation study including real feed samples from different compositions and origins. The MICT assay is the first quantitative assay for feed enzymes that is fast, reliable, and simple to use outside of a specialized reference laboratory and that is suitable for use in place of the current ISO assay.","output":"A New Rapid and Quantitative Assay to Determine the Phytase Activity of Feed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Aims We undertook this study to define the incidence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile in our hospital and to characterise the isolates.

Detection of tcdA and tcdB genes was carried out for A2B+ strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole, vancomycin and clindamycin for all isolates were tested using the Etest. PCR ribotyping was carried out on all isolates. Results The incidence of Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) was 3.2 cases per 1000 admissions or discharges and 53.8 cases per 100000 patient days. Most cases occurred in renal and haematology patients. CDAD was more common in patients aged over 50 years and of male gender. The Indian population was under-represented. Fourteen (11.8%) isolates were A-B+. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole but one strain showed intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Only 12.8% of the isolates were susceptible to clindamycin. Thirty-five isolates had PCR ribotype A, of which 29 (83%) had a clindamycin MIC >256mg/L.

This is in sharp contrast to most existing DAG learning methods assuming Gaussian noise with additional variance assumptions to attain exact DAG recovery. The proposed method leverages a novel concept of topological layer to facilitate the DAG learning. Particularly, we show that the topological layers can be exactly reconstructed in a bottom-up fashion, and the parent-child relations among nodes in each layer can also be consistently established. More importantly, the proposed method does not require the faithfulness or parental faithfulness assumption which has been widely assumed in the literature of DAG learning.

These predictions are often based on parasite optima or evolutionary equilibria derived from models of host-parasite dynamics. Yet even when such models accurately capture the parasite optima, newly invading parasites will typically not be at their optima. Here we show that parasite invasion of a host population can occur despite highly nonoptimal virulence. Fitness improvements soon after invasion may proceed through many steps with wide changes in virulence, because fitness depends on transmission as well as virulence, and transmission improvements can overwhelm nonoptimal virulence. This process is highly sensitive to mutation supply and the strength of selection. Importantly, the same invasion principle applies to the evolution of established parasites, whenever mutants arise that overcome host immunity/resistance. A host population may consequently experience repeated invasions of new parasite variants and possible large shifts in virulence as it evolves in an arms race with the parasite.

Outbreak investigations were implemented to obtain contact tracing data and to establish chains of transmission. Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 with samples within the cohort was performed. Investigations of 951 HCWs and staff with quarantined travelers were implemented to determine the chain of transmission. Genomic and outbreak investigations identified the international travelers infected with the B.1.1.31 SARS-CoV-2 lineage as the source of this outbreak. The genomic data and the investigated timeline revealed a putative transmission chain among HCWs, pointing toward the transmission via the use of common living quarters at the investigated quarantine site. The evaluation of this cohort has led to a policy recommendation on quarantine facility management. International travel quarantine is an important strategy to contain importation of COVID-19 cases. However, a quarantine facility is likely to become a potential hotspot, requiring thorough preventive measures. Reducing the exposure risk by providing private living quarters and scheduling clinical duties at a quarantine site separated from the conventional healthcare workforce have been implemented.","output":"COVID-19 Transmission among Healthcare Workers at a Quarantine Facility in Thailand: Genomic and Outbreak Investigations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s11469-020-00418-6.].","output":"Correction to: Succumbing to the COVID-19 Pandemic-Healthcare Workers Not Satisfied and Intend to Leave Their Jobs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quick spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic and more than fifteen million confirmed cases.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of sciences until April 25, 2020. We included a total of 15 studies with 2277 patients. Platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer (D-D), and fibrinogen (FIB) were collected and analyzed. The statistical results were expressed as the effect measured by mean difference (MD) with the related 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The PLT level of severe cases was lower than that of mild cases, while the levels of PT, D-D, and FIB were higher than those of mild cases (P < 0.05). The level of APTT had no statistical difference between two groups (P > 0.05). PT of ICU patients was significantly longer (P < 0.05) than that of non-ICU patients. In non-survivors, PT and D-D were higher, yet PLT was lower than that of survivors (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in APTT between survivors and non-survivors (P > 0.05).

The pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus whose main protease (Mpro) is a promising drug target since it plays a key role in viral proliferation and replication. Currently, developing an effective therapy is an urgent task, which requires accurately estimating the ligand-binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, it should be noted that the accuracy of a free energy method probably depends on the protein target. A highly accurate approach for some targets may fail to produce a reasonable correlation with the experiment when a novel enzyme is considered as a drug target. Therefore, in this context, the ligand-binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was calculated via various approaches. The molecular docking approach was manipulated using Autodock Vina (Vina) and Autodock4 (AD4) protocols to preliminarily investigate the ligand-binding affinity and pose to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The binding free energy was then refined using the fast pulling of ligand (FPL), linear interaction energy (LIE), molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA), and free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. The benchmark results indicated that for docking calculations, Vina is more accurate than AD4, and for free energy methods, FEP is the most accurate method, followed by LIE, FPL, and MM-PBSA (FEP > LIE &#8776; FPL > MM-PBSA). Moreover, atomistic simulations revealed that the van der Waals interaction is the dominant factor. The residues Thr26, His41, Ser46, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145, His164, Glu166, and Gln189 are essential elements affecting the binding process.

However, to employ the applications in human models, it is desirable and sometimes mandatory to study non-human animals first. To acquire further precise and controlled signals and parameters, the animals studied must be further distant from their spontaneous ventilation. The majority of respiratory mechanics studies use positive pressure ventilation to model the respiratory system. In this scenario, a few drug categories become relevant: anesthetics, muscle blockers, bronchoconstrictors, and bronchodilators. Hence, the main objective of this study is to briefly review and discuss each drug category, and the impact of a drug on the assessment of respiratory mechanics. Before and during the positive pressure ventilation, the experimental animal must be appropriately sedated and anesthetized. The sedation will lower the pain and distress of the studied animal and the plane of anesthesia will prevent the pain. With those drugs, a more controlled procedure is carried out; further, because many anesthetics depress the respiratory system activity, a minimum interference of the animal's respiration efforts are achieved. The latter phenomenon is related to muscle blockers, which aim to minimize respiratory artifacts that may interfere with forced oscillation techniques. Generally, the respiratory mechanics are studied under appropriate anesthesia and muscle blockage. The application of bronchoconstrictors is prevalent in respiratory mechanics studies. To verify the differences among studied groups, it is often necessary to challenge the respiratory system, for example, by pharmacologically inducing bronchoconstriction. However, the selected bronchoconstrictor, doses, and administration can affect the evaluation of respiratory mechanics. Although not prevalent, studies have applied bronchodilators to return (airway resistance) to the basal state after bronchoconstriction.

In 2018 the flu vaccination was first provided at community pharmacies in Estonia. The aims of this study were to evaluate the experience of flu vaccination at community pharmacies by pharmacy customers and to learn about the perception of community pharmacists regarding the immunization service. METHOD: Two cross-sectional surveys: among pharmacy customers after receiving flu vaccination (n = 257), and for pharmacy professionals (n = 209). Descriptive statistics were calculated in both studies. RESULTS: In the pharmacy customers\` study, 54.9% received flu vaccination for the first time. Most of the respondents (96.8%) were satisfied with the quality of service. In both studies, community pharmacies were described as an accessible and convenient setting for immunization. Age and working experience of pharmacy professionals influenced the readiness to provide flu immunization, with younger pharmacists (<36 years) keener to be involved in vaccination services (p < 0.01). EXPERT OPINION: Increasing influenza vaccination in high-risk patient groups is crucial. The involvement of other healthcare professionals, such as community pharmacists, could be key to reaching these patient groups and improving access to vaccination services in general. The development of the pharmacy profession has also shifted from pharmaceutical product based to patient oriented approach with provision of more clinical services. This enables to use professional competency of pharmacists in healthcare more widely. Lack of resources (financial, healthcare professionals, etc.) and an aging population are driving new ways to deliver healthcare more efficiently with the pharmacist working with other healthcare providers taking greater responsibility for patient health outcomes.

We classified these mutations into three groups: high-frequent, low-frequent non-synonymous, and low-frequent synonymous. Analysis of the dynamics of these mutations by month and continent showed that high-frequent mutations appeared early in the pandemic, all are present in all continents and some of them are almost fixed in the global population. On the other hand, low-frequent mutations (non-synonymous and synonymous) appear late in the pandemic and seems to be at least partially continent-specific. This could be due to that high-frequent mutation appeared early when lockdown policies had not yet been applied and low-frequent mutations appeared after lockdown policies. Thus, preventing global dissemination of them. Finally, we present a brief structural and functional review of the analyzed ORFs and the possible implications of the 25 identified non-synonymous mutations.","output":"Analysis of the Dynamics and Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 Mutations and its Possible Structural and Functional Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficiency of cooperative communication protocols to increase the reliability and range of transmission for Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is proven, but identity verification and communication security are required to be ensured. Though it is difficult to maintain strong network connections between vehicles because of there high mobility, with the help of cooperative communication, it is possible to increase the communication efficiency, minimise delay, packet loss, and Packet Dropping Rate (PDR). However, cooperating with unknown or unauthorized vehicles could result in information theft, privacy leakage, vulnerable to different security attacks, etc. In this paper, a blockchain based secure and privacy preserving authentication protocol is proposed for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Blockchain is utilized to store and manage the authentication information in a distributed and decentralized environment and developed on the Ethereum platform that uses a digital signature algorithm to ensure confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, and preserving the privacy of the IoVs. For optimized communication, transmitted services are categorized into emergency and optional services. Similarly, to optimize the performance of the authentication process, IoVs are categorized as emergency and general IoVs. The proposed cooperative protocol is validated by numerical analyses which show that the protocol successfully increases the system throughput and decreases PDR and delay. On the other hand, the authentication protocol requires minimum storage as well as generates low computational overhead that is suitable for the IoVs with limited computer resources.","output":"A Blockchain-Based Authentication Protocol for Cooperative Vehicular Ad Hoc Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo O novo coronavrus, SARS-CoV-2, causador da doen?a COVID-19, foi detectado em 31 de dezembro de 2019 em Wuhan, na China.

Resultados Foram includos no estudo 72 indivduos, com mdia de idade de 60,2 anos (25-94), desses, 39 foram do sexo masculino (54,2%). Foram includos 25 (18%) pacientes no GNS e 47 (82%) no GS. Em relao ao GNS, o GS apresentou um aumento na contagem de neutrfilos/L (P = 0,002) e na relao neutrfilos/linfcitos (P < 0,001); alm disso, apresentou diminuio na contagem de linfcitos/L totais (P = 0,043).

METHODS: This prospective cohort study included all players and essential support staff participating in 26 DP World Tour events from 18 April 2021 to 21 November 2021. High-risk contacts were isolated for 10 days. Moderate-risk contacts received education regarding enhanced medical surveillance, had daily rapid antigen testing for 5 days, with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tesing on day 5, mandated mask use and access to outside space for work purposes only. Low-risk contacts typically received rapid antigen testing every 48 hours and RT-PCR testing on day 5. RESULTS: The total study cohort compromised 13 394 person-weeks of exposure. There were a total of 30 positive cases over the study period. Eleven contacts were stratified as high risk. Two of these subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. There were 79 moderate-risk contact and 73 low-risk contacts. One moderate-risk contact subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but did not transmit the virus.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate, thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. METHODS: Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after 1975, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 10005 (CI95: [08130-11881]) and 12046 (CI95: [07532-16560]), allowing us to reject fairly modest effects of universal BCG vaccination. We can reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19 among middle-aged individuals.","output":"BCG vaccination in infancy does not protect against COVID-19.

In the phase I study, beginning a median of 46 days after ASCT for hematologic malignancy, cohorts of three to four patients received escalating doses of induction IL-2 of 9, 10, or 12  10(6) IU/m(2)/day for 4 or 5 days by continuous i.v. infusion (CIV), followed by a 4-day rest period, and then 1.6  10(6) IU/m(2)/day of maintenance IL-2 by CIV for 10 days. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of induction IL-2 was 9  10(6) IU/m(2)/day  4. In the phase II study, 52 patients received the MTD. Eighty percent of patients completed induction IL-2.

We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Science Direct, and Google Scholar electronic databases. A total of 32 cases were included in our study. The most common presenting symptom was tachycardia in 22/32 patients (68.7%), followed by tachypnoea (21/32, 65.6%), fever, and rash (12/32, 37.5% for both of them). Cardiac arrest, loss of consciousness, and systemic infection were associated with the worst prognosis, with statistically significant differences (p-value 0.001, 0.02, 0.001. respectively). A percentage as high as 90.4% of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and reduced ejection fraction (EF) were discharged.

Several cellular receptors facilitate SARS-CoV-2 Spike docking at the cell surface, of which ACE2 plays a key role in many cell types. The intermediate filament protein vimentin has been reported to be present at the surface of certain cells and act as a co-receptor for several viruses; furthermore, its potential involvement in interactions with Spike proteins has been proposed. Nevertheless, the potential colocalization of vimentin with Spike and its receptors on the cell surface has not been explored. Here we have assessed the binding of Spike protein constructs to several cell types. Incubation of cells with tagged Spike S or Spike S1 subunit led to discrete dotted patterns at the cell surface, which consistently colocalized with endogenous ACE2, but sparsely with a lipid raft marker. Vimentin immunoreactivity mostly appeared as spots or patches unevenly distributed at the surface of diverse cell types. Of note, vimentin could also be detected in extracellular particles and in the cytoplasm underlying areas of compromised plasma membrane. Interestingly, although overall colocalization of vimentin-positive spots with ACE2 or Spike was moderate, a selective enrichment of the three proteins was detected at elongated structures, positive for acetylated tubulin and ARL13B. These structures, consistent with primary cilia, concentrated Spike binding at the top of the cells.

In particular, the mucosal epithelium of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is at the very forefront of the battles between the host and the invading pathogens. Recent studies have revealed that the epithelium not only constitutes a physical barrier but also takes an essential role in the activation of the immune system. One of the mechanisms equipped in the epithelium to fight against microorganisms is the Toll-like receptor (TLR) response. TLRs recognize common structural components of microorganisms and activate the innate immune system, resulting in the production of a plethora of cytokines and chemokines in the response against microbes. As the epithelia-derived cytokines are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and allergic rhinitis (AR), the molecules involved in the TLR response may be utilized as therapeutic targets for these diseases. There are several differences in the TLR response between nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, and knowledge of the TLR signals in the upper airway is sparse compared to that in the lower airway.

This chapter presents the most important principles of prophylactic and therapeutic, and oral application of immunoglobulins. Because of the production conditions today about 20C40% of newborn farm animals (cattle, pigs, horses, goats, sheep) exhibit failure of passive transfer (FPT). The direct consequence of this is an increased susceptibility to diseases during the first weeks of life, which necessitates the wide use of antibiotics. As a further consequence, an increasing antibiotic-resistance of diarrheal strains of bacteria has become a fact. An alternative to using antibiotic is oral application of immunoglobulin products in the periods of greatest risk that is within the first days of life and in the postweaning period. Air-dried egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY), cow colostrum and swine serum, which can be produced on a large scale, provide the greatest chance for mass application. The most important protective role is played by specific antibodies against antigens present in the neonate's environment. The chapter discusses application of xenogenic antibodies. There are several indications for the application of cow colostrum to foals, lambs and kids, such as lack of, or low quality of maternal colostrum, mastitis, twins or multiple fetuses, and so on. Serum produced from the blood of slaughtered swine allows the large-scale production of immunoglobulins.

To address this gap, an exploratory multiple case study was performed using semi-structured interviews with 18 representatives of four manufacturing companies and six representatives of companies in a supporting role. A socio-technical systems perspective was adopted to cover the interconnectedness and complementarity of internal and external elements relevant for providing a smart PSS. The study identified 46 capabilities of digital servitization to offer and perform smart PSSs and systemically classified these within the dimensions of the socio-technical systems theory, thus providing companies with numerous insights into successful digital servitization. The results contribute to the practical and academic understanding of digital servitization by outlining capabilities to offer and perform smart PSSs and providing support for the use of socio-technical systems theory to frame these capabilities systematically.","output":"Capabilities of digital servitization: Evidence from the socio-technical systems theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Deutschland werden j?hrlich etwa 4 Millionen Erythrozytenkonzentrate transfundiert.

In general, nerves or muscles and the spinal cord influence numerous neuromuscular disorders. The clinical examination plays a major role in early finding and diagnosis of these diseases; this research study focused on the prediction of muscular paralysis using EMG signals. Machine learningCbased diagnosis of the diseases has been widely used due to its efficiency and the hybrid feature extraction (FE) methods with deep learning classifier are used for the muscular paralysis disease prediction. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method is applied to decompose the EMG signal and reduce feature degradation. The proposed hybrid FE method consists of Yule-Walker, Burgs method, Renyi entropy, mean absolute value, min-max voltage FE, and other 17 conventional features for prediction of muscular paralysis disease. The hybrid FE method has the advantage of extract the relevant features from the signals and the Relief-F feature selection (FS) method is applied to select the optimal relevant feature for the deep learning classifier. The University of California, Irvine (UCI), EMG-Lower Limb Dataset is used to determine the performance of the proposed classifier.

The aim of this study was therefore to determine the prevalence, associations and reasons for use of CAM during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among a representative sample of the Norwegian population, and determine possible effects and adverse effects of the treatments. Methods: Computer assisted telephone interviews using a COVID-adapted I-CAM-Q questionnaire were conducted with 1008 randomly selected Norwegians aged 16 and above using multistage sampling during April and May 2020 applying age and sex quotas for each area. Descriptive statistics were carried out using Pearsons Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Independent samples T-tests to identify group differences. Results: The study revealed that two thirds of the respondents (67%) had used CAM within the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular CAM modalities that did not involve a provider. Most used were natural remedies and dietary supplement (57%, mainly vitamins and minerals), but self-help practices like yoga and meditation were also widely used (24%). Women used CAM modalities significantly more than men (77% vs. 58%). Most of the respondents found the modalities they used beneficial, and 5% reported adverse effects of the treatments. Conclusions: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not profoundly changed the overall need of Norwegian citizens to seek care outside the conventional healthcare system, but rather caused a shift in the type of CAM modalities used.

METHODS: In total, 1,033 participants (320 men and 713 women) older than 60 years of age participated in this study. Depressive symptoms, social isolation status, and socio-demographic and health-related covariates were assessed at baseline. The primary outcome measure was 2-year all-cause mortality. Data were collected through in-person interviews by trained interviewers. The GENMOD procedure was used to calculate relative risks (RRs). RESULTS: Of the 1,033 participants, 102 (40 men and 62 women) died within the follow-up period of 2 years. During the 2-year follow-up period, 17.8% of depressed men and 12.3% of depressed women died, and 29.8% of socially isolated men and 14.9% of socially isolated women died. Social isolation was an independent predictor of mortality in elderly men (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 4.6, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 10.2), while depressive symptoms were an independent predictor of mortality in elderly women (aRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.6) when controlling for potential confounding factors. However, the depressive symptoms detected using the geriatric depression scale were not associated with mortality in men, and social isolation was not associated with mortality in women.

We asked all plastic and esthetic surgery residents in our country to fill out a questionnaire to investigate changes in their didactical activity and analyze problems about their professional growth in the last few months. From the results of such questionnaires, we found that most of the residents feel the decrease in surgical activities during this time is a detrimental factor for their training and that even if all the schools have changed their didactical activities no school has introduced the use of virtual simulators to compensate for the decrease in surgical practice. Actually, the majority of residents use webinars to keep updated, stating that such technologies are useful but not sufficient to analyze plastic surgery topics in depth during COVID-19 lockdown. Virtual interactive tools are well known in different clinical and surgical specialties, and they are considered as a valid support, but it seems that in plastic surgery they are not so used. According to the most recent studies about residents' didactical program, we have investigated the potential of Anatomage Table in combination with Touch Surgery application as physical and mental aids to bypass the decreased number and kind of surgical interventions performed in this particular time. Anatomage is an academic user-friendly touch screen table; it is used by both medical students and residents to learn human anatomy and to master surgical anatomy.

Result: A total of 1241 DEGs were screened, including 1049 up-regulated genes and 192 down-regulated genes. Besides, 10 hub genes were obtained from the PPI network , among which the expression level of CXCL2 , Etv7 , and HIST1H2BG was found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: In conclusion, bioinformatics analysis reveals genes and cellular pathways that are significantly altered in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This is conducive to further guide the clinical study of SARS-CoV-2 and provides new perspectives for vaccine development.","output":"Identification of Differential Gene Expression and Related Signaling Pathways In SARS-COV-2 Infected Human Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SESSION TITLE: Late-breaking Abstract Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: Evaluate patients with pneumomediastinum (PTM) as a complication of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) infection and their outcomes METHODS: Data was obtained by retrospective analysis of a database of Covid-19 patients, admitted to two New York hospitals from March 25th to April 26th, 2020 Identified 13 patients with PTM as a complication of Covid-19 RESULTS: Median age of patients was 67 years, 7 (54%) were men, and 1 patient had pre-existing emphysema Presenting symptoms included dyspnea (13/13, 100%), fever (10/13, 77%), and cough (9/13, 69%);none had chest pain Median presenting SaO2/FiO2 ratio was 359 Pneumomediastinum was diagnosed on presentation in 2 patients (15%), during hospitalization but prior to invasive mechanical ventilation in 4 patients (31%), and after invasive mechanical ventilation in 7 patients (54%) Six patients had CT scans confirming the diagnosis of PTM Twelve of the 13 patients were initiated on mechanical ventilation at median 5 5 days Four patients (31%) developed pneumothoraces and 1 patient required bilateral chest tube drainage Tension pneumothorax, tension pneumopericardium, and chest wall compartment syndrome were not observed in our cohort Pneumomediastinum self-resolved in 5 patients (38%) while on mechanical ventilation (Fig 1) Seven out of 12 intubated patients (58%) underwent prone ventilation without worsening of PTM One patient was discharged home, 10 patients expired, and 2 patients remain hospitalized CONCLUSIONS: Pneumomediastinum is a known sequelae of noncompliant lungs in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), typically in the setting of positive pressure delivered with invasive mechanical ventilation Our cohort had a low prevalence of predisposing risk factors such as emphysema, and a high mortality Pneumomediastinum was not strongly associated with mechanical ventilation, as nearly half (6/13) of the patients developed PTM prior to intubation CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In our cohort, findings of PTM may be attributed to two main etiologies converging: damage from Covid-19 and self-inflicted increases in transpulmonary pressures We postulate that impaired surfactant production from type II pneumocytes may predispose to atelectrauma leading to diffuse alveolar injury and risk of rupture, unlike in typical ARDS where barotrauma occurs in the context of poorly compliant lungs Moreover, the increased work of breathing and pronounced cough seen in Covid-19 pneumonia may lead to increased transpulmonary pressures resulting in PTM Reductions in transpulmonary pressures after intubation with initiation of sedation and neuromuscular blockade may explain the resolution of PTM in spite of invasive ventilation Given the high mortality we observed, early identification and initiation of methods to reduce transpulmonary pressures is imperative to reduce risk of further complications DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Young Im Lee, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Nan Li, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Joseph Mathew, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Lina Miyakawa, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Paru Patrawalla, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Paru Patrawalla, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Adam Rothman, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Vishad Sheth, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by David Steiger, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Jigna Zatakia, source=Web Response","output":"Pneumomediastinum as a Complication of Covid-19: May Not Need Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case managers are a ubiquitous group of professionals whom others rely upon when times are difficult.

The dysregulated immune response which results in ARDS and cytokine storm has an outstanding role in the progression of pulmonary damage in COVID-19. IL-6, through induction of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, is the pioneer of the hyperinflammatory condition and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19. Therefore, IL-6 pathway blockade is considered an emerging approach with high efficacy to reduce lung damage in COVID-19. This article aims to review the pleiotropic roles of the IL-6 pathway in lung damage and ARDS in severe COVID-19, and the rationale for IL-6 signaling blockade at different levels, including IL-6 soluble and membrane receptor pathways, IL-6 downstream signaling (such as JAK-STAT) inhibition, and non-specific anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches. Recent clinical data of each method, with specific concentration on tocilizumab, along with other new drugs, such as sarilumab and siltuximab, have been discussed. Challenges of IL-6 signaling inhibition, such as the risk of superinfection and hepatic injury, and possible solutions have also been explained. Moreover, to achieve the highest efficacy, ongoing clinical trials and special clinical considerations of using different IL-6 inhibitors have been discussed in detail. Special considerations, including the appropriate timing and dosage, monotherapy or combination therapy, and proper side effect managment must be noticed regarding the clinical administration of these drugs. Future studies are still necessary to improve the productivity and unknown aspects of IL-6 signaling blockade for personalized treatment of severe COVID-19.","output":"An updated overview of recent advances, challenges, and clinical considerations of IL-6 signaling blockade in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While several lines of evidence suggest a protective role of T cells against disease associated with Dengue virus (DENV) infection, their potential contribution to immunopathology in the acute phase of DENV infection remains controversial, and it has been hypothesized that the more severe form of the disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) is associated with altered T cell responses. To address this question, we determined the transcriptomic profiles of DENV-specific CD8+T cells in a cohort of 40 hospitalized DENV donors with either a milder form of the disease (dengue fever, DF) or a more severe disease form (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF). We found multiple transcriptomic signatures, one associated with DENV-specific Interferon-gamma responding cells, and two other gene signatures, one specifically associated with the acute phase, and the other with the early convalescent phase. Additionally, we found no differences in quantity and quality of DENV-specific CD8+T cells based on disease severity.

We report a contemporary 5-year experience with endovascular therapy for MCA aneurysms at a high-volume neurovascular center. METHODS Review of prospectively maintained intracranial aneurysm database. RESULTS Between 2005 and 2009, 148 patients underwent treatment of 149 MCA aneurysms at our hospital, of which 33 patients with 34 aneurysms underwent endovascular therapy. Among these 33 patients, 14 presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Eleven patients were treated with stent-assisted coiling, 1 with balloon-assisted coiling, and the remainder with coiling alone. Three patients required repeat endovascular treatment. There were 7 periprocedural complications, including intraprocedural aneurysm rupture resulting in death in 2 patients. Two patients died at later dates from remote aneurysm rehemorrhage. Average follow-up of remaining patients was 17.1 months radiographically, and 20.3 months clinically. Average modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at last follow up was 2.09, with 17 patients with mRS 0/1 and 5 patients with mRS 2. Fifteen patients showed evidence of radiographic residual at last follow up: 13 were simple neck residuals. Unruptured status and saccular aneurysms were associated with mRS 0/1 outcome (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS At our hospital, MCA aneurysms are being treated with endovascular techniques, but in a minority of patients. Despite the rate of residual neck remnants, few retreatments were necessary and few rehemorrhages occurred. The periprocedural complication rate was not insignificant; therefore, in more recent years and at present, most MCA aneurysms are considered for clipping first at our center.","output":"Results of endovascular treatment of middle cerebral artery aneurysms after first giving consideration to clipping."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to quantify the impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on new case referrals to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) service.

It is strongly related to work overload and has been a scarcely studied topic in pediatric urology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities' recommendations have led to big changes in pediatric urology practice worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the level of burnout in Ibero-American pediatric urologists (IPUs) during this pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted by applying an electronic survey during the COVID-19 pandemic peak to members of the two major associations of pediatric urology in Ibero-America (the Ibero-American Society of Pediatric Urology [SIUP] and the Brazilian School of Pediatric Urology [BSPU]) to evaluate demographic, pre-pandemic, and pandemic data. Burnout levels were assessed using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) questionnaire. RESULTS: A response rate of 40% was obtained (182 out of 455 IPU respondents). Participants were from 14 different countries in Ibero-America and 75.4% were male. Data showed that during the pandemic there was a significant decrease in weekly workload, that is: > 40 h per week (h/w) (91.4%-44.6%, p < 0.001); and >6 h/w (94.9%-45.1%%, p < 0.001) in operating room time (ORT). Personal (Pe-BO), work-related (W-BO), and patient-related (Pa-BO) burnout levels among IPUs were 26.3%, 22.3%, and 7.4%, respectively (Summary table). An important difference by gender was seen, with women suffering more from the syndrome (odds ratio of 2.67 [95% confidence interval, 1.285.58; p = 0.013] for Pe-BO and OR of 3.26 [95% CI, 1.52-7.01; p = 0.004] for W-BO). CONCLUSION: A significant decrease in workload for IPU during the pandemic was observed, as well as a low level of burnout syndrome during this time. However, the predominance of burnout in women found in this study is notable.","output":"Burnout syndrome in pediatric urology: A perspective during the COVID-19 pandemic - Ibero-American survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound mental health consequences for many people. Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world. METHODS: We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms \\"suicide\\" and \\"cause of death\\", before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis). FINDINGS: We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 081 [95% CI 072-091]); Alberta, Canada (080 [068-093]); British Columbia, Canada (076 [066-087]); Chile (085 [078-094]); Leipzig, Germany (049 [032-074]); Japan (094 [091-096]); New Zealand (079 [068-091]); South Korea (094 [092-097]); California, USA (090 [085-095]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (079 [067-093]); Texas (four counties), USA (082 [068-098]); and Ecuador (074 [067-082]). INTERPRETATION: This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond if the situation changes as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold.

The transgenic mice were infected with Candida albicans intravenously to study how DC-SIGN expression affected the pathogenesis of systemic candidiasis. We discovered that, while C. albicans infection induced renal fibrosis in both transgenic and littermate control mice, the transgenic mice had significantly lower levels of Acta2, Col1a2, Col3a1, and Col4a1 mRNA transcripts compared to the controls. KIM-1, an emerging biomarker for kidney injury, along with Tnf, Il6, and Tgfb1 transcripts, were lower in infected transgenic mice, and yet, the levels of Il10 remained comparable to the controls. While renal CD45(+) infiltrating cells were the source of Tnf, Il6, and Il10, LTL(+) renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were TGF-1 producers in both infected transgenic and littermate controls. DC-SIGN-expressing tubular epithelial cells produced less TGF-1 in response to C. albicans infection. In vivo experiments demonstrated that renal proximal tubular epithelial cell production of TGF-1 was key to C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis and injury. Infection of transgenic mice induced a marked increase of phosphorylated Raf-1 and p38 in the kidney. However, ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation was more pronounced in the infected-littermate controls. Interestingly, treating the infected transgenic mice with a Raf-1 inhibitor increased the levels of the Tgfb1, Kim1, and Acta2 transcripts. These results indicate that DC-SIGN signaling, through activation of Raf-1 and p38 and suppression of JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, reduces TGF-1 production and C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis.

In order to clarify the underlying complexity of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus interactions, we propose the imaginary diabetes-COVID-19 molecular tetrahedron with four lateral faces consisting of SARS-CoV-2 entry via ACE2 (lateral face 1), the viral hijacking and replication (lateral face 2), acute inflammatory responses (lateral face 3), and the resulting insulin resistance (lateral face 4). The entrance of SARS-CoV-2 using ACE2 receptor triggers an array of multiple molecular signaling beyond that of the angiotensin II/ACE2-Ang-(1C7) axis, such as down-regulation of PGC-1 /irisin, increased SREBP-1c activity, upregulation of CD36 and Sirt1 inhibition leading to insulin resistance. In another arm of the molecular cascade, the SARS-CoV-2 hijacking and replication induces a series of molecular events in the host cell metabolic machinery, including upregulation of SREBP-2, decrement in Sirt1 expression, dysregulation in PPAR-?, and LPI resulting in insulin resistance.

Characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and PE suspicion who required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were also analysed. METHODS: A retrospective study from March 18, 2020, until April 11, 2020. Inclusion criteria were patients with suspected PE and positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Exclusion criteria were negative or inconclusive RT-PCR and other chest CT indications. CTPA features were evaluated and severity scores, presence, and localisation of PE were reported. d-dimer and IL-6 determinations, ICU admission, and previous antithrombotic treatment were registered. RESULTS: Forty-seven PE suspicions with confirmed COVID-19 underwent CTPA. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with PE with a predominant segmental distribution. Statistically significant differences were found in the highest d-dimer determination in patients with PE and ICU admission regarding elevated IL-6 values. CONCLUSION: PE in COVID-19 patients in our series might predominantly affect segmental arteries and the right lung. Results suggest that the higher the d-dimer concentration, the greater the likelihood of PE. Both assumptions should be assessed in future studies with a larger sample size. KEY POINTS: ? On CT pulmonary angiography, pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients seems to be predominantly distributed in segmental arteries of the right lung, an assumption that needs to be approached in future research. ?

Material and methods This was a web-based study, in which the frequency and type of virtual social media used by students as a source of information about COVID-19 were evaluated by the available sampling method. The statistical population of the study consisted of 500 students of medical universities in Iran. In the first step, administrators of student groups across the country were identified and contacted and asked to assist the research team by placing a link to complete the questionnaire, after which students voluntarily completed the online questionnaire in a self-reporting manner. Results The mean age of participants was 31.29 10.8 years. The selection percentages based on the number of selections were: WhatsApp (35.2), Instagram (32.7), Telegram (21.2), Facebook (8.3) and other networks (2.6). Regarding the relationship between the educational level (p < 0.001) and the field of study (p < 0.01), a statistically significant difference was found for the question of which media information is more acceptable in relation to obtaining information related to COVID-19. Conclusions It was found that social media will enable these media to act as a powerful tool to change the behavior of people and promote the well-being of individuals and public health.

Two independent reviewers evaluated them using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We extracted the results and assessed seven domains of bias for each study.

The crude effect of age (5.2% and 13.4% higher risk of disease severity and death per age year, respectively) substantially decreased when adjusting for important age-dependent risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease/cerebrovascular disease, compromised immunity, previous respiratory disease, renal disease). Adjusting for all six comorbidities indicates a 2.7% risk increase for disease severity (two studies), and no additional risk of death per year of age (five studies).

Hybridization has been reported to increase antimicrobial activity. Here, two proline-rich peptides (consP1: VRKPPYLPRPRPRPL-CONH(2) and Bac5-v291: RWRRPIRRRPIRPPFWR-CONH(2)) were combined with two arginine-isoleucine-rich peptides (optP1: KIILRIRWR-CONH(2) and optP7: KRRVRWIIW-CONH(2)). Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) are known to inhibit the bacterial ribosome, shown also for Bac5-v291, whereas it is hypothesized a dirty drug model for the arginine-isoleucine-rich peptides. That hypothesis was underpinned by transmission electron microscopy and biological small-angle X-ray scattering (BioSAXS). The strength of BioSAXS is the power to detect ultrastructural changes in millions of cells in a short time (seconds) in a high-throughput manner. This information can be used to classify antimicrobial compounds into groups according to the ultrastructural changes they inflict on bacteria and how the bacteria react towards that assault. Based on previous studies, this correlates very well with different modes of action. Due to the novelty of this approach direct identification of the target of the antimicrobial compound is not yet fully established, more research is needed. More research is needed to address this limitation. The hybrid peptides showed a stronger antimicrobial activity compared to the proline-rich peptides, except when compared to Bac5-v291 against E. coli. The increase in activity compared to the arginine-isoleucine-rich peptides was up to 6-fold, however, it was not a general increase but was dependent on the combination of peptides and bacteria. BioSAXS experiments revealed that proline-rich peptides and arginine-isoleucine-rich peptides induce very different ultrastructural changes in E. coli, whereas a hybrid peptide (hyP7B5GK) shows changes, different to both parental peptides and the untreated control. These different ultrastructural changes indicated that the mode of action of the parental peptides might be different from each other as well as from the hybrid peptide hyP7B5GK. All peptides showed very low haemolytic activity, some of them showed a 100-fold or larger therapeutic window, demonstrating the potential for further drug development.","output":"Rational Designed Hybrid Peptides Show up to a 6-Fold Increase in Antimicrobial Activity and Demonstrate Different Ultrastructural Changes as the Parental Peptides Measured by BioSAXS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A failure to ensure racial equity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused Black communities in Canada to disproportionately be impacted. The aim of the current study was to determine the needs and concerns of Black communities in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and to highlight the importance of collecting race-based COVID-19 data early on to address these needs. METHODS: Six qualitative interviews were conducted with local community health centre leaders who serve a high population of racialized communities within the GTA. Content analysis was used to extract the main themes and concerns raised during the interviews. RESULTS: The findings from this study provide further evidence of the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on Black and other racialized communities. Difficulty self-isolating due to overcrowded housing, food insecurity, and less social support for seniors were concerns identified by community health leaders. Also, enhanced financial support for front-line workers, such as Personal Support Workers (PSWs), was an important concern raised. In order to lessen the impact of the pandemic on these communities, leaders noted the need for greater accessibility of testing centres in these areas and a greater investment in tailored health promotion approaches.

Among these is the endangered Visayan Hornbill (Penelopides panini), found on the islands of Panay and Negros. Threatened by habitat loss and hunting, its population size is thought to have declined from 1800 individuals 20 years ago to less than 1000. However, a recent study on Negros estimated 3564 individuals across three core forest blocks. This study aims to quantify the Visayan Hornbill population size in and around the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park (NWPPNP) on Panay, the largest contiguous low-elevation forest landscape remaining across its range, and its broad habitat associations across a gradient of environmental degradation. METHODS: Hornbills were surveyed using 10-min distance sampling point counts (n = 367) along transects (average length 1.1 km). Environmental variables were recorded along transects, while habitat was classified into primary forest, secondary forest, plantation, or open habitat. Distance software was used to estimate population densities stratified by habitat, with the overall population estimate taken as a mean of habitat density estimates weighted by habitat area. Using generalized linear mixed models, hornbill occurrence was modelled using combinations of nine environmental variables as main and two-way fixed effects. RESULTS: Surveys covered 204.4 km(2) of the 374.8 km(2) Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbills were not recorded in plantations or open habitats. Hornbill density was significantly higher in primary forest (17.8 individuals/km(2)  26.9% CV) than in secondary forest (3.7 individuals/km(2)  33.2% CV; z = 15.212, P < 0.001). The overall population estimate for the NWPPNP and environs is 2109 individuals, and 2673 individuals for the entire Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbill presence was best explained by a model including distance from the Park boundary alongside five interaction effects and transect as a random effect. Distance, and the interaction between distance and medium-sized trees were significant predictors of hornbill presence. CONCLUSIONS: Our study evidences the habitat preference of the Visayan Hornbill, highlights the importance of the NWPPNP for the species conservation, and provides strong evidence for re-assessing the global population size.

In this study, we seek to evaluate the haptic perception evoked from concurrent stimulation trains through multiple channels using transcutaneous nerve stimulation. METHODS A 2x8 electrode grid was used to deliver current to the median and ulnar nerves in the upper arm. Different electrodes were first selected to activate the sensory axons, which can elicit sensations at different locations of the hand. Charge-balanced bipolar stimulation was then delivered to two sets of electrodes concurrently with a phase delay (dual stimulation) to determine whether the evoked sensation can be reconstructed from sensations of single stimulation delivered separately at different locations (single stimulation) along the electrode grid. The temporal delay between the two stimulation locations trains were altered to evaluate potential interference. The short-term stability of the haptic sensation within a testing session was also evaluated. RESULTS The evoked sensation during dual stimulation was largely a direct summation of the sensation from single stimulations. The delay between the two stimulation locations had minimal effect on the evoked sensations, which was also stable in the short-termover repeated testing within a session.

Moreover, the growth process was analyzed through standard enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy of biosynthesis. The average standard Gibbs energy of biosynthesis was found to be +463.0 kJ/C-mol. Thus, photosynthesis provides energy and carbon for plant growth. The average intercepted photosynthetic energy was found to be 15.5 MJ/C-mol for the analyzed plants. However, due to inefficiency, a great fraction of the intercepted photosynthetic energy cannot be used by plants. The average usable photosynthetic energy was found to be C2.3 MJ/C-mol.

Policymakers and DPT operators need to know whether their system works as expected in terms of speed or yield (performance) and whether DPT is making an effective contribution to pandemic mitigation (also in comparison to and beyond established mitigation measures, particularly manual contact tracing). Thereby, performance and effectiveness are not to be confused. Not only are there conceptual differences but also diverse data requirements. This article describes differences between performance and effectiveness measures and attempts to develop a terminology and classification system for DPT evaluation.

Therefore, the terminology and a classification matrix may offer some guidance to DPT system operators regarding which measurements to prioritize. DPT developers and operators may also make conscious decisions to integrate measures for epidemic monitoring but should be aware that this introduces a secondary purpose to DPT that is not part of the original DPT design. Ultimately, the integration of further information for epidemic monitoring into DPT involves a trade-off between data granularity and linkage on the one hand, and privacy on the other.

Previously, we reported that an endoribonuclease (EndoU) encoded by murine coronavirus plays a pivotal role in evasion of host innate immune defenses in macrophages. Here, we asked if the EndoU activity of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), which causes acute diarrhea in swine, plays a role in antagonizing the innate response in porcine epithelial cells and macrophages, the sites of viral replication. We constructed an infectious clone of PEDV-Colorado strain (icPEDV-wt) and an EndoU-mutant PEDV (icPEDV-EnUmt) by changing the codon for a catalytic histidine residue of EndoU to alanine (His226Ala). We found that both icPEDV-wt and icPEDV-EnUmt propagated efficiently in interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero cells. In contrast, the propagation of icPEDV-EnUmt was impaired in porcine epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), where we detected an early and robust transcriptional activation of type I and type III IFNs. Infection of piglets with the parental Colorado strain, icPEDV-wt, or icPEDV-EnUmt revealed that all viruses replicated in the gut and induced diarrhea; however, there was reduced viral shedding and mortality in the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected animals. These results demonstrate that EndoU activity is not required for PEDV replication in immortalized, IFN-deficient Vero cells, but is important for suppressing the IFN response in epithelial cells and macrophages, which facilitates replication, shedding, and pathogenesis in vivo. We conclude that PEDV EndoU activity is a key virulence factor that suppresses both type I and type III IFN responses. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) can emerge from an animal reservoir into a naive host species to cause pandemic respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases with significant mortality in humans or domestic animals. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV), infects gut epithelial cells and macrophages, inducing diarrhea and resulting in high mortality in piglets. How PEDV suppresses the innate immune response was unknown. We found that mutating a viral endoribonuclease, EndoU, results in a virus that activates both the type I interferon response and the type III interferon response in macrophages and epithelial cells. This activation of interferon resulted in limited viral replication in epithelial cell cultures and was associated with reduced virus shedding and mortality in piglets. This study reveals a role for EndoU activity as a virulence factor in PEDV infection and provides an approach for generating live-attenuated vaccine candidates for emerging coronaviruses.","output":"Coronavirus Endoribonuclease Activity in Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Suppresses Type I and Type III Interferon Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing measures adopted in various countries to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to unwanted effects on their populations' health and behaviors This study aimed to investigate smoking behavior in the Brazilian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze factors associated with the increase in cigarette consumption An online survey was performed, and the final sample included 45,160 individuals The study used post-stratification weights and calculated crude prevalence ratios (PR) and adjusted by sex, age, and schooling, and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to analyze associations between increased cigarette consumption and sociodemographic variables and adherence to social distancing, quality of sleep, state of mind, and changes in work and earnings Prevalence of smokers was 12% (95%CI: 11 1-12 9), 34% of whom reported an increase in cigarette consumption The increase was greater among women (PR = 1 27;95%CI: 1 01-1 59) and individuals with incomplete secondary schooling (PR = 1 35;95%CI: 1 02-1 79) The increase in cigarette consumption was associated with worse quality of sleep, feeling isolated from family members or sad, depressed, or anxious, loss of earnings, and worse self-rated health Health promotion strategies, smoking prevention, and encouragement for smoking cessation, as well as mental health interventions, should be continued and reinforced in the context of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Factors associated with increased cigarette consumption in the Brazilian population during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical epidemiology and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who did not experience fever and cough during the early pandemic.

The main outcome variable was atypical presentation, defined as any hospitalized patient with COVID-19 infection who did not experience both fever and cough. We identified risk factors for atypical presentation on univariate and multivariate analyses and assessed 30-day mortality differences via survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 163 patients in the study, 39 (24%) were atypical. On univariate analysis, atypical cases were significantly more likely to be older, reside in a long-term-care facility (LTCF), and have underlying diabetes mellitus, stroke, or cardiac disease;present without dyspnea or myalgia, have lower C-reactive proteins (CRP) and higher beta-natriuretic peptides. They were less likely to receive intensive care unit care or specific COVID-19 treatments (P &lt; .05). The incidence of acute respiratory failure was not significantly different between the groups. On logistic regression, atypical cases were significantly more likely to be LTCF residents (P = 0.003) and have a lower average CRP (P = 0.01). Atypical cases had significantly higher 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6 - 7.2], P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: During the first pandemic surge, COVID-19 patients without inflammatory signs and symptoms were more likely to be LTCF residents and had higher mortality. Timely recognition of these atypical presentations may have prevented spread and improved clinical outcomes.","output":"Risk Factors and Mortality for Atypical Presentation of COVID-19 Infection in Hospitalized Patients - Lessons From the Early Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This contribution argues that Reddit, as a massive, categorized, open-access dataset, is a useful data source, for\\"almost any topic\\".

Recognising that technology has long played a role in co-design practice, we argue that to date, the technologically mediated experience of co-design has been largely based on the assumption of replicating the physical and embodied experience of the co-design workshop. Rather than accepting the deficit culture implied through the curtailing of much of the conventional face-to-face activities we associate with co-design, this paper reports on proactive research into novel possibilities for continuing collaborative research work through the concept of 'low-contact co-design'.

Our objectives were to define the frequency of myocardial injury using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and to understand how to use its prognostic abilities. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in Italy in 2020. Hs-cTnI was sampled based on clinical judgment. Myocardial injury was defined as values above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limits (URLs). Most data is from the initial hospital value. RESULTS: 426 unique patients were included. Hs-cTnI was measured in 313 (73.5%) patients; 85 (27.2%) had myocardial injury at baseline. Patients with myocardial injury had higher mortality during hospitalization (hazard ratio = 9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55-17.79], p < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis including clinical and laboratory variables demonstrated an AUC of 0.942 with modest additional value of hs-cTnI. Myocardial injury was associated with mortality in patients with low APACHE II scores (<13) [OR (95% CI): 4.15 (1.40, 14.22), p = 0.014] but not in those with scores > 13 [OR (95% CI): 0.48 (0.08, 2.65), p = 0.40]. Initial hs-cTnI < 5 ng/L identified 33% of patients that were at low risk with 97.8% sensitivity (95% CI 88.7, 99.6) and 99.2% negative predictive value. Type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) and type 2 MI were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS: hs-cTnI at baseline is a significant predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

The dysregulated production of free radicals is a marked characteristic of several clinical conditions, and antioxidant machinery plays a pivotal role in scavenging the excessive free radicals, thereby preventing and treating infections in animals. Supplementation of seaweeds to animal diet can boost antioxidant activity, immunity, and the gut environment. Dietary supplementation of seaweeds can also enhance meat quality due to the deposition of marine-derived antioxidant components in muscles. The use of natural antioxidants in the meat industry is a practical approach to minimize or prevent lipid oxidation. However, overconsumption of seaweeds, especially brown macroalgae, should be avoided because of their high iodine content. An important point to consider when including seaweeds in animal feed is their variable composition which depends on the species, habitat, location, harvest time, growing conditions such as nutrient concentration in water, light intensity, temperature, etc. This review highlights the beneficial applications of seaweeds and their extracted compounds, which have antioxidant properties as feed additives and impact animal health and production.","output":"Antioxidant effects of seaweeds and their active compounds on animal health and production C a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the risk factors affecting early diffuse recurrence within 1 year of percutaneous ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS Out of 146 patients who received transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for treatment of recurrent HCC after percutaneous ultrasound-guided RFA, we selected 23 patients with early diffuse recurrence. Early diffuse recurrence was defined as three or more new recurrent HCCs within 1 year of initial RFA. As a control group, we selected 23 patients, matched exactly for age and sex, in which there was no local tumour progression or new recurrence after RFA. To analyse the risk factors, we examined patient factors and tumour factors. RESULTS Recurrent tumours occurred from 30 to 365 days after RFA (median time, 203 days). Univariate analysis indicated that larger tumour size and poorly defined margin were significant risk factors (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that poorly defined margin was a significant risk factor (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Larger tumour size and poorly defined margin may be risk factors for early diffuse recurrence of HCC within 1 year of RFA.

We here report the outcome of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) segmentectomy with and without the assessment of sentinel nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-three patients with stage IA NSCLC underwent VATS segmentectomy between January 2003 and December 2010. Twenty patients underwent indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and 63 did not. Intraoperative real-time quantitative RT-PCR to determine the expression of CK-19 was used for evaluation of metastasis. Perioperative outcome, local recurrence rates and survival were compared in both groups. RESULTS Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with segmentectomy in the SNB group. The false negative rate was 0%. By RT-PCR for CK-19 expression, only one of these patients showed positive sentinel nodes, which indicated isolated tumor cells; however, segmentectomy was not converted to lobectomy. Seven of 63 patients with VATS segementectomy without SNB and none of the SNB group relapsed. In the relapsed patients without SNB, 4 (6.3%) were local recurrences and 3 (4.7%) were distant metastases. Recurrence-free survival rates in both groups were not significantly different because of the short follow-up period of the SNB group.

However, evolving variants of the virus appear to be more transmissive and vaccine efficacy towards them is waning. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 will continue to have a deadly impact on public health into the foreseeable future. One strategy to bypass the continuing problem of newer variants is to target host proteins required for viral replication. We have used this host-targeted antiviral (HTA) strategy that targets DDX3, a host DEAD-box RNA helicase that is usurped by SARS-CoV-2 for virus production. We demonstrated that targeting DDX3 with RK-33, a small molecule inhibitor, reduced the viral load in four isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (Lineage A, and Lineage B Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants) by one to three log orders in Calu-3 cells. Furthermore, proteomics and RNA-seq analyses indicated that most SARS-CoV-2 genes were downregulated by RK-33 treatment. Also, we show that the use of RK-33 decreases TMPRSS2 expression, which may be due to DDX3s ability to unwind G-quadraplex structures present in the TMPRSS2 promoter. The data presented supports the use of RK-33 as an HTA strategy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of its mutational status, in humans.","output":"RK-33, a small molecule inhibitor of host RNA helicase DDX3, suppresses multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Immunoglobulins (Igs) comprise a critical part of the immune response.

The focus is on types of conflicts, measures of their (communicative) processing and the connections between conflict type, conflict object (technology) and conflict management. All in all, there is a clear need for research on customized approaches. Most approaches to (communicative) processing of conflict situations remain rather general. There are only a few authors, who consider the parameters conflict type and conflict object (e.g., wind energy versus deep geothermal energy). These consider primarily the types distribution conflict, value conflict, knowledge conflict and social conflict. The findings and recommendations on conflict communication are primarily based on the participation forms of information, cooperation and consultation. Recommendations on the information level are considered to be independent of the type of conflict, whereas measures on the cooperation and consultation level depend on the type of conflict. Less influence is ascribed to the variable technology. The focus is on (conflict- and technology-type related) topics and stakeholder groups and formats. Overall, it is noteworthy that formats are mentioned and presented, but mostly lack specific information on the how, i.e., the conflict-reducing communicative design of the processes and formats. Hints on how to do this are offered by a few studies on energy communication, which were also evaluated in this article.

Patients at risk are those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressed patients such as those undergoing treatment for hematological cancer or recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. COVID 19 infection is known to produce a state of hyper inflammation with release of various cytokines this state of immune dysfunction is associated with development of opportunistic infections, of which Mucormycosis is on the rise currently. The widespread use of corticosteroids can cause secondary infections including mucormycosis. CNS penetration typically starts with nasal involvement followed by the paranasal sinuses and palate, ultimately invading the orbit and brain or by direct hematological spread which is called as Rhino-orbito-cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM) .

We argue that while populism is a worldwide phenomenon, it is not homogenous and the UK is particularly vulnerable to anti-status quo discourses and narratives.

Unfortunately, these interventions lack solid evidence regarding long-term safety and possible late respiratory function sequelae, raising crescent concerns after the COVID-19 pandemic onset and possibly resulting in reduced propensity to use this technique. The study of the distal anatomy of the phrenic nerves may lead to a better understanding of their branching patterns, and thus the proposition of surgical approaches that better preserve patient respiratory function. METHODS: Twenty-one phrenic nerves in ten formalized cadavers were scrutinized. Pre-diaphragmatic branching patterns were inspected through analysis of the distance between the piercing site of the nerve at the diaphragm and the cardiac structures, number of divisions, and length from the point where the main trunk emits its branches to the diaphragm. RESULTS: The main trunk of the right phrenic nerve reaches the diaphragm near the inferior vena cava and branches into three major divisions. The left phrenic nerve reaches the diaphragm in variable locations near the heart, branching into two to five main trunks.

Social behaviours are not localized to subdivisions of the amygdala even though the inputs and outputs that carry social signals are anatomically restricted to distinct subnuclear regions. This observation may be explained by the multidimensional response properties of the component neurons. Indeed, the multitudes of circuits that converge in the amygdala enlist the same subset of neurons into different ensembles that combine social and non-social elements into high-dimensional representations. These representations may enable flexible, context-dependent social decisions. As such, multidimensional processing may operate in parallel with subcircuits of genetically identical neurons that serve specialized and functionally dissociable functions. When combined, the activity of specialized circuits may grant specificity to social behaviours, whereas multidimensional processing facilitates the flexibility and nuance needed for complex social behaviour.","output":"Multidimensional processing in the amygdala."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although a plethora of research articles on AI methods on COVID-19 medical imaging are published, their clinical value remains unclear.

Residents choosing ACP were older, frailer, more cognitively impaired and malnourished; 384/404 (95%) residents choosing ACP recorded their care home as their preferred place of death: 380/404 (94%) declined cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among deceased residents, 219/248 (88%) and 33/49 (67%) with and without advance care plan respectively died in their care home (relative risk 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1C1.6, P < 0.001). Hospital admission rates and bed occupancy did not differ after implementation. DISCUSSION: About 79.5% participants chose ACP. Those doing so were more likely to die at home. Many homes were unwilling or unable to support the service. Hospital admissions were not reduced. Further research should consider how to enlist the support of all homes and to explore why hospital admissions were not reduced.","output":"Advance care plans in UK care home residents: a service evaluation using a stepped wedge design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Historically sinonasal malignancies were always addressed via open craniofacial surgery for an oncologic resection. Increasingly esthesioneuroblastomas are excised using an exclusively endoscopic approach, however, the rarity of this disease limits the availability of long-term and large scale outcomes data. Objective The primary objective is to evaluate the treatment modalities used and the overall survival of patients with esthesioneuroblastoma managed with exclusively endoscopic surgery. Methods In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, PubMed was queried to identify studies describing outcomes associated with endoscopic management of esthesioneuroblastomas. Results Forty-four out of 2462 articles met inclusion criteria, totaling 399 patients with esthesioneuroblastoma treated with an exclusively endoscopic approach. Seventy-two patients (18.0%) received adjuvant chemotherapy and 331 patients (83.0%) received postoperative radiation therapy. The average age was 50.6 years old (range 6-83). Of the 399 patients, 57 (16.6%) were Kadish stage A, 121 (35.2%) were Kadish stage B, 145 (42.2%) were Kadish stage C, and 21 (6.1%) were Kadish stage D. Pooled analysis demonstrated that 66.0% of patients had Hyams histologic Grade  or , while 34.0% of patients had Grade  or  disease. Negative surgical margins were achieved in 86.9% of patients, and recurrence was identified in 10.3% of patients. Of those with 5-year follow-up, reported overall survival was 91.1%. Conclusion Exclusively endoscopic surgery for esthesioneuroblastoma is performed for a wide range of disease stages and grades, and the majority of these patients are also treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Reported overall recurrence rate is 10.3% and 5-year survival is 91.1%.","output":"Exclusively endoscopic surgical resection of esthesioneuroblastoma: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as the most common cell source for stem cell therapy, play an important role in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses and have been widely used in clinical trials to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Recent experimental and clinical studies have shown that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) can inhibit the activation and proliferation of a variety of proinflammatory cells, such as Th1, Th17 and M1 macrophages, reducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, while promoting the proliferation of anti-inflammatory cells, such as M2 macrophages and Tregs, and increasing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus playing a role in immune regulation and exhibiting immunomodulatory functions. Besides MSC-EVs are more convenient and less immunogenic than MSCs. There is growing interest in the role of MSC-EVs in liver diseases owing to the intrinsic liver tropism of MSC-EVs. In this review, we focus on the immunomodulatory effects of MSC-EVs and summarize the pivotal roles of MSC-EVs as a cell-free therapy in liver diseases, including NAFLD, AIH, acute liver failure, liver fibrosis and hepatic ischemiaCreperfusion injury.

With few exceptions, these are lower in East and Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries compared with other regions. Epidemiological differences may reflect differences in border closures, lockdowns, and social distancing measures taken by each county, and by cultural differences, such as common use of face masks in East and Southeast Asian countries. The plasma serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin was suggested to protect from COVID-19 by inhibiting TMPRSS2, a cell surface serine protease essential for the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here, we present evidence that population differences in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency allele frequencies may partially explain national differences in the COVID-19 epidemiology. Our study compared reported national estimates for the major alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles PiZ and PiS (SERPINA1 rs28929474 and rs17580, respectively) with the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center dataset. We found a significant positive correlation (R = .54, P = 1.98e-6) between the combined frequencies of the alpha-1 antitrypsin PiZ and PiS deficiency alleles in 67 countries and their reported COVID-19 mortality rates. Our observations suggest that alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles may contribute to national differences in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality rates. Population-wide screening for carriers of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles should be considered for prioritizing individuals for stricter social distancing measures and for receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available.","output":"Ethnic differences in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency allele frequencies may partially explain national differences in COVID-19 fatality rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious public health, social, and economic damage worldwide and effective drugs that prevent or cure COVID-19 are urgently needed.

To identify drugs with higher antiviral potency, we screened approved anti-parasitic/anti-protozoal drugs and identified an anti-malarial drug, Mefloquine, which showed the highest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity among the tested compounds.

Mefloquine inhibited viral entry after viral attachment to the target cell. Combined treatment with Mefloquine and Nelfinavir, a replication inhibitor, showed synergistic antiviral activity. Our mathematical modeling based on the drug concentration in the lung predicted that Mefloquine administration at a standard treatment dosage could decline viral dynamics in patients, reduce cumulative viral load to 7% and shorten the time until virus elimination by 6.1 days.

RESULTS: The ACE2 receptor plays a role in introducing viral material into the cell, having high expression in type II alveoli. Histopathological analyzes of the lungs of patients with COVID-19 show that SARS-CoV-2 produces, in this organ, in addition to an inflammatory process, a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Macroscopically, the lungs become heavier, firmer, and redder. The clinical features of these patients are variable;the most common are respiratory symptoms associated with fever, myalgia, or fatigue. CONCLUSION: The observations points to the consensus that the lungs are the main targets of COVID-19, with morphological and functional changes of interest, including important sequels, and presenting diffuse alveolar damage as a substrate for an unfavorable outcome with ARDS. Changes in micro and macroscopic levels corroborate to the clinical progression of the disease and that these alterations are not specific, which ratify, in addition to the anatomopathological examination, a need to use the association of clinical and epidemiological data for diagnostic confirmation.","output":"Anatomopathological Aspects and Clinical Correlation of COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.","output":"A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease with both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations.

Previous cookstove trials have reported low adoption of new stoves and/or extensive continued traditional stove use. Methods: The Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial randomized 3195 pregnant women in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda to either a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel intervention (n = 1590) or to a control (n = 1605). The intervention consisted of an LPG stove and two initial cylinders of LPG, free fuel refills delivered to the home, and regular behavioral messaging. We assessed intervention fidelity (delivery of the intervention as intended) and adherence (intervention use) through to the end of gestation, as relevant to the first primary health outcome of the trial: infant birth weight. Fidelity and adherence were evaluated using stove and fuel delivery records, questionnaires, visual observations, and temperature-logging stove use monitors (SUMs). Results: 1585 women received the intervention at a median (interquartile range) of 8.0 (5.0C15.0) days post-randomization and had a gestational age of 17.9 (15.4C20.6) weeks. Over 96% reported cooking exclusively with LPG at two follow-up visits during pregnancy. Less than 4% reported ever running out of LPG. Complete abandonment of traditional stove cooking was observed in over 67% of the intervention households. Of the intervention households, 31.4% removed their traditional stoves upon receipt of the intervention; among those who retained traditional stoves, the majority did not use them: traditional stove use was detected via SUMs on a median (interquartile range) of 0.0% (0.0%, 1.6%) of follow-up days (median follow-up = 134 days). Conclusions: The fidelity of the HAPIN intervention, as measured by stove installation, timely ongoing fuel deliveries, and behavioral reinforcement as needed, was high.

METHODS: An online survey was distributed through social media targeting the adult population of Malta. Questions on sociodemographic data, occurrence of back pain pre\\\\Covid\\\\19 and since the onset of Covid\\\\19 was gathered, along with changes in behavioural attitudes, daily routine and physical activity. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Out of the 388 responders, 30% experienced chronic back pain pre\\\\Covid\\\\19, 49% experienced back pain since Covid\\\\19, with the majority of the latter claiming that they never experienced back pain before Covid\\\\19. Significant changes were present in daily routine and physical activity (PA) patterns.

Yet, progress to SDG 13 and the entire 2030 Agenda might today appear unlikely to meet. To change this situation, it is necessary to form professionals aware of the impacts of climate change and competent to respond efficiently to its adaptation and mitigation. In this context, the purpose of this study is to reveal the beliefs and concerns about global warming of Mexican students enrolled in engineering bachelor's degrees at higher education institutes that promote sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: In an exploratory study, engineering university students at six large public universities in Mexico answered questions regarding their beliefs and concerns regarding climate change. The study was carried out by using the Global Warming's Six Americas survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by a research team from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University to identify different audiences within the American public regarding climate change. Participants were recruited via convenience/snowball techniques which provided access to a diverse sample. Those who agreed to partake in the study were directed to an online platform via Google forms. Data were collected from January to April 2021. Coding and data treatment was conducted according to the developers' codebook and SPSS scripts. After running the statistical program scripts to determine the respondents' segment, a univariate descriptive analysis was performed for each item in the questionnaire to describe general properties in each variable. Subsequently, a series of correspondence analyses was conducted to examine the existence of clusters or patterns that could indicate relationships among selected questions. Findings: The findings of this study revealed that the majority of the Mexican engineering higher education students participating in the survey fell in the segment of alarmed, 47.3%, or the segment of concerned, 46.%. Furthermore, 78.6% of higher education students in the alarmed segment were extremely sure that global warming is happening. In addition, 98% believed that it is caused mostly by human activities. Furthermore, 89% stated that global warming would harm them personally significantly and 96% thought that future generations would be harmed considerably. About 78% believed that people in Mexico and the USA are currently being harmed by global warming. On the other hand, about 45% of students in the concerned group noted they were extremely sure. In addition, 96% of them thought that global warming is being produced mostly by anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, 39% said global warming will harm them personally to a great deal. However, nearly 80% noted that global warming would also hurt future generations. Although those students in the alarmed and concerned group show similar beliefs and concerns about global warming, the magnitude of concern was more significant for those in the alarmed segment. Research limitations/implications: There are several limitations to the study. First, the online questionnaire did not allow for clarification or follow-up on behalf of the respondents. Therefore, it could be possible that respondents misunderstood some items. However, the research team took the following measures to limit confusion: (1) The questionnaire had been previously used in several studies. None of these studies reported problems related to confusion, so the research team took this fact as evidence of the acceptable reliability of the questionnaire. (2) A face-to-face pilot test was carried out with 30 university students where no problems of comprehension were reported. (3) The target population had adequate prior knowledge of climate change, so the possibility of misunderstandings was likely low. A second limitation relates to the nature of the study. Fighting to mitigate the global climate crisis is a positive social norm. Respondents may have provid d answers in line with this social norm and presented themselves as more pro-environmental than they actually are. Second, because of our selection criteria, our data may overestimate the general public's worldviews on climate change. Finally, this study was carried on during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have impacted items' responses. These limitations constitute future opportunities for future research. Specifically, future research might ideally use a large-scale comprehensive study evaluating the broader Mexican public's beliefs and views about climate change. Furthermore, because our data showed that our respondents were very concerned about climate change, but did little in terms of behavioral mitigation, future research should continue to examine and explore differences in various measures of climate friendly behaviors among different segments of the population. Practical implications: This study's findings have at least twofold implications for university authorities and sustainability practitioners in their pursuit of meeting SDG 13. The first implication is related to academic life. Undoubtedly, having a high percentage of students believing in global warming and mainly that this phenomenon is by anthropogenic activities is a strong indication of their knowledge. But, indirectly, these results validate the sustainability teaching and research efforts in their HEIs, implying the commitment to sustaining and improving the quality of their sustainability-educational initiatives in all institutional areas. The second implication of our findings is related to HEIs' future commitments to address the target of SDG 13 during the present Decade of Actions. Results also lead us to reflect on the role of Mexican HEIs as agents of change, beyond offering good instruction on climate science as an agent of socialization to encourage positive mitigation and adaptation behaviors among the general population. Social implications: The social implication behind the environmental values of younger people found in this study is that a deeper understanding of these millennials' beliefs and concerns toward global warming will help Mexican policymakers implement policies in this regard and hopefully will be endorsed by a significant proportion of the Mexican population. Originality/value: The originality of this study is the application of the Global Warming's Six Americas survey questionnaire in higher education settings. Therefore, the knowledge generated determines the quality of the article. As findings in this study revealed, there is apparently little disagreement among the Mexican engineering higher education students about the belief of the existence of global warming and this phenomenon is being caused mainly by human-related activities. Nevertheless, a minority of students still believe that global warming is caused naturally or not occurring. However, it is not possible to claim victory, as these achievements should not be considered, in any way, a guarantee that students will carry out behaviors in their daily lives that impact a reduction in global warming.

We also reviewed studies reporting rates of ED equipment contamination. PubMed was searched for studies that included adherence rates among ED personnel to HH during routine patient care, aseptic technique during the placement of central venous catheters and urinary catheters, and rates of equipment contamination. RESULTS: In total, 853 studies was screened, and 589 abstracts were reviewed. The full texts of 36 papers were examined, and 23 articles were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. Eight studies used various scales to measure HH compliance, which ranged from 7.7% to 89.7%. Seven articles examined central venous catheters inserted in the ED or by emergency medicine residents.

Concerns have been raised about whether home confinement may have worsened the burden of myopia owing to substantially decreased time spent outdoors and increased screen time at home. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the refractive changes and prevalence of myopia in school-aged children during the COVID-19 home confinement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cross-sectional study using school-based photoscreenings in 123 535 children aged 6 to 13 years from 10 elementary schools in Feicheng, China, was conducted. The study was performed during 6 consecutive years (2015-2020). Data were analyzed in July 2020. EXPOSURES: Noncycloplegic photorefraction was examined using a photoscreener device. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The spherical equivalent refraction was recorded for each child and the prevalence of myopia for each age group during each year was calculated. The mean spherical equivalent refraction and prevalence of myopia were compared between 2020 (after home confinement) and the previous 5 years for each age group. RESULTS: Of the 123 535 children included in the study, 64 335 (52.1%) were boys. A total of 194 904 test results (389 808 eyes) were included in the analysis. A substantial myopic shift (approximately ?0.3 diopters [D]) was found in the 2020 school-based photoscreenings compared with previous years (2015-2019) for younger children aged 6 (?0.32 D), 7 (?0.28 D), and 8 (?0.29 D) years. The prevalence of myopia in the 2020 photoscreenings was higher than the highest prevalence of myopia within 2015-2019 for children aged 6 (21.5% vs 5.7%), 7 (26.2% vs 16.2%), and 8 (37.2% vs 27.7%) years. The differences in spherical equivalent refraction and the prevalence of myopia between 2020 and previous years were minimal in children aged 9 to 13 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be associated with a significant myopic shift for children aged 6 to 8 years according to 2020 school-based photoscreenings. However, numerous limitations warrant caution in the interpretation of these associations, including use of noncycloplegic refractions and lack of orthokeratology history or ocular biometry data. Younger childrens refractive status may be more sensitive to environmental changes than older ages, given the younger children are in a critical period for the development of myopia.","output":"Progression of Myopia in School-Aged Children After COVID-19 Home Confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As we approach the grim milestone of a million people killed by covid-19, Adam Vaughan examines the toll of the pandemic so far","output":"One million global deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Introduction The main prevention strategy for reducing the dispersion of the SARS-CoV-2 has been social distancing. Several investigations began to explore its psychological impact since it began, but there are no data about its effect on social and family behavior. Objectives Were: First, to analyze the reliability of an ad-hoc designed questionnaire to measure sociofamily behavior changes in a sample of parents of children from one to twelve years old. Second, to characterize effects of voluntary social isolation by COVID-19 over sociofamily behavior at a personal level and over children's activities at home. Third, to determine vulnerability predictors for a negative experience by isolation itself. Method An online Questionnaire for Perceptions of Changes in Sociofamily Behavior was applied to 365 Mexican participants. Results Factor analysis showed a reliability of the ad-hoc designed questionnaire for this study. Correlations were found between voluntary social isolation and self-perceived experiences, such as sleep quality, irritability, emotional control, hope about the future, motivation, attention span, and problem solving. Discussion and conclusion The results of this study suggest that family well-being during voluntary social isolation is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon, which addresses specific effects in different domains, especially in sociofamily behavior.","output":"COVID-19 voluntary social isolation and its effects in sociofamily and children's behavior/ Aislamiento social voluntario por COVID-19 y sus efectos en la conducta sociofamiliar e infantil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We live in an era in which the most valued services are not paid for in money, but in personal data.

In this study, we postulate that CT findings can be used to ascertain the overall disease burden and predict the clinical outcome. METHODS: In this prospective study undertaken from March 28, 2020, until May 20, 2020, 142 patients with CT features suggestive of viral pneumonia, and positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 were enrolled. A dedicated spiral CT scanner was used for all COVID-19 suspects. CT features were reported as typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19 pneumonia. A CT involvement score (CT-IS) was given to each scan and assigned mild, moderate, or severe category depending on the score range. The patients were followed up for at least 15 days. RESULTS: Ground glass opacity was present in 100% of the patients. There was a significant association between CT-IS and the final outcome of the patients. A statistically significant increasing trend of mortality and requirement of critical medical attention was observed with the rising value of CT-IS in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The severe CT-IS score group has a high mortality. The CT-IS score could be valuable in predicting clinical outcome and could also be useful in triage of patients needing hospital admission. In situations where healthcare resources are limited, and patient load high, a more careful approach for patients with higher CT-IS scores could be indispensable.

The system is developed to assist in response to government's efforts at curtailing the spread of the novel COVID-19 pandemic and other high temperature-related diseases such as Ebola and Lassa fever. The device when installed in a premise does an automated temperature screening using its non-contact temperature sensors. It grants access only to users with temperature within the normal body temperature range (35.5 o C to 38 o C) and denies access to users whose temperatures are higher than the normal temperature. It performs authentication through which it acquires user's identity details such as name, sex, and address through its sensors and sends them with the acquired temperature to a remote database where the data so acquired can be further analysed. This data is useful for contact tracing, monitoring speed of diseases and for the purpose of planning/prevention of future occurrence. The developed device is incorporated with solar power which makes it usable in places with inadequate or without grid power. Being an automatic device, it functions without a human operator compared to hand-held infrared thermometer which can only be used when the screening officials are on ground.

However, eggs of ground-nesting species can be exposed when pesticide applications occur during laying or incubation. We simulated environmentally realistic exposures of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) eggs to an herbicide (2,4-D) and a fungicide (tebuconazole) applied to winter cereal crops during the breeding season of most farmland birds. We analyzed effects on hatching success, offspring survival and physiology. Exposure by overspray led to greater pesticide accumulation in the eggshell or content than exposure through contact with treated soil (3.1 to 13.7 times higher, depending on the pesticide and target sample). Egg overspray with tebuconazole significantly increased chick mortality, which was 26% higher than that of controls. 2,4-D caused a similar but close to significant increase (chick mortality 24% higher than controls). Exposure to either pesticide through contact with treated soils did not affect chick survival but altered some biochemical parameters post-hatching.

For stem cell-based clinical applications it is highly important to gain knowledge about the migration behavior of adult human stem cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms of this ability. Human blood serum has been shown to have beneficial effects on other regenerative capacities of adult human stem cells. Within this study we tested the effect of human blood serum on the migration behavior of stem cells from the human heart. We used a microfluidic cultivation device, which allowed us to monitor the living cells and their movement behavior in real time. After addition of human blood serum, the heart stem cells increased their speed of movement and covered distance. Further, we observed that this effect could be diminished by inhibition of a specific kinase, p38-MAPK. Thus, our data suggest beneficial effects of human blood serum on adult human heart stem cells dependent on p38-MAPK. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of stem cell migration and introduces a new platform to monitor stem cell movement in real time. ABSTRACT: Migratory capabilities of adult human stem cells are vital for assuring endogenous tissue regeneration and stem cell-based clinical applications. Although human blood serum has been shown to be beneficial for cell migration and proliferation, little is known about its impact on the migratory behavior of cardiac stem cells and underlying signaling pathways. Within this study, we investigated the effects of human blood serum on primary human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) from the adult heart auricle. On a technical level, we took advantage of a microfluidic cultivation platform, which allowed us to characterize cell morphologies and track migration of single hCSCs via live cell imaging over a period of up to 48 h. Our findings showed a significantly increased migration distance and speed of hCSCs after treatment with human serum compared to control. Exposure of blood serum-stimulated hCSCs to the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) inhibitor SB239063 resulted in significantly decreased migration. Moreover, we revealed increased phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) upon serum treatment, which was diminished by p38-MAPK-inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate human blood serum as a strong inducer of adult human cardiac stem cell migration dependent on p38-MAPK/Hsp27-signalling. Our findings further emphasize the great potential of microfluidic cultivation devices for assessing spatio-temporal migration dynamics of adult human stem cells on a single-cell level.","output":"Human Blood Serum Induces p38-MAPK- and Hsp27-Dependent Migration Dynamics of Adult Human Cardiac Stem Cells: Single-Cell Analysis via a Microfluidic-Based Cultivation Platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A number of viruses and viral proteins interact with a dynamic sub-nuclear structure called the nucleolus. The nucleolus is present during interphase in mammalian cells and is the site of ribosome biogenesis, and has been implicated in controlling regulatory processes such as the cell cycle. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and its antigens; viral proteins co-localise with factors such as nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin, and can cause their redistribution during infection. Viruses can use these components as part of their replication process, and also use the nucleolus as a site of replication itself. Many of these properties are not restricted to any particular type of virus or replication mechanism, and examples of these processes can be found in DNA, RNA and retroviruses. Evidence suggests that viruses may target the nucleolus and its components to favour viral transcription, translation and perhaps alter the cell cycle in order to promote virus replication. Autoimmunity to nucleolin and fibrillarin have been associated with a number of diseases, and by targeting the nucleolus and displacing nucleolar antigens, virus infection might play a role in the initiation of these conditions.","output":"The nucleolus C a gateway to viral infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The contradiction between the regional imbalance and an one-size-fits-all policy is one of the biggest challenges in current air pollution control in China.

The study aimed to investigate the changes in lifestyle, access to health services, and mental wellbeing during the first Italian lockdown in a sample of Italian pregnant women and new mothers. METHODS: We carried out a web-based survey to evaluate how pregnant women and new mothers were coping with the lockdown. We collected data about healthy habits (physical exercise and dietary habits), access to health services (care access, delivery and obstetric care, neonatal care, and breastfeeding), and mental wellbeing (psychological well-being and emotive support). Descriptive analysis was performed for both groups of participants, whereas a Poisson analysis was used to measure the association between some structural variables (age, education, socio-economic data, partner support, contact, free time, previous children, and pregnancy trimester) and anxiety or depression, difficulties in healthy eating and reduction in physical activity after lockdown started. Chi2 and Adjusted Prevalence Ratios were estimated only for pregnant women. RESULTS: We included 739 respondents (response rate 85.8 %), 600 were pregnant (81.2 %), and 139 (18.8 %) had delivered during lockdown (new mothers). We found a high score for anxiety and depression in 62.8 % of pregnant women and 61.9 % of new mothers. During the lockdown, 61.8 % of pregnant women reduced their physical exercise, and 44.3 % reported eating in a healthier way. 94.0 % of new mothers reported to have breastfed their babies during the hospital stay. Regarding the perceived impact of restrictive measures on breastfeeding, no impact was reported by 56.1 % of new mothers, whereas a negative one by 36.7 %.

Few rehabilitation exercises concerning COVID-19 patients were reported. Here, we present a modified version of rehabilitation exercises based on the underlying mechanism of the disease to mild cases of COVID-19. These exercises aimed to improve the pulmonary function of patients and ease the expectoration process. Additionally, an essential branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) named acupressure was integrated into the exercises to facilitate the recovery and maintenance of pulmonary function. METHODS From March 4, 2020 to May 5, 2020, a total of 60 COVID-19 patients who completed the full course of MRE were enrolled in this observational study. The diagnostic and classification criteria were based on the 7th edition of Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline of COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. We prospectively gathered patients' reported outcomes concerning respiration-related symptoms at four different time points, including: (I) at admission; (II) at the time of hospital discharge; (III) two weeks after discharge; (IV) four weeks after discharge. The reported respiratory symptoms included dry cough, productive cough, difficulty in expectoration, and dyspnea. RESULTS In total, 60 confirmed mild COVID-19 cases were enrolled with a median age of 54 years old. The baseline prevalence for dry cough, productive cough, difficulty in expectoration, and dyspnea were 41.7%, 43.3%, 35.0%, and 50.0%, respectively. The pronounced decline in symptom prevalence was recorded over time. Interestingly, four weeks after discharge, we noticed a lower remission rate in productive cough and difficulty in expectoration. CONCLUSIONS The modified rehabilitation exercises were retrieved from the Eight-Section Brocade, and are specifically designed for rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients at home or health facilities.

Viral shedding is extensive before the equally rapid resolution of acute disease.

Previous reviews have described the inhibition of cellular innate responses in the infected cell both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we present a review of virus inhibition of cells that are a source of antiviral function in swine. Particularly in the case of dendritic cells and natural killer cells, the virus has evolved mechanisms to interrupt the normal function of these important mediators of innate function, even though these cells are not infected by the virus.

This double role affects teachers' mental health negatively. Still, open schools are important for pupils' learning and wellbeing. Hence, it is crucial to identify viable strategies for virus control that can be implemented in schools without draining teachers' resources. Thus, our aim was to analyze the sustainability of interventions aimed at hindering spread of virus in public schools. METHODS: The qualitative data consisted of 700 free text responses from a survey among 1332 Danish schoolteachers from Nov 25 to Dec 9, 2020, i.e. when facing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Thematic Network Analysis, we analyzed the participants' answers to the question What initiatives to prevent the spread of infection would you be able to carry out for a longer period of time? RESULTS: Most initiatives consumed resources (financial, staffing, time, mental, and relational) to an extend that was unacceptable for the participants. Improved hygiene and ventilation were sustainable initiatives given that the allocation of responsibility was clear. The sustainability of using visor/facemask was compromised by its negative effects on social interactions and by stigma. Isolation of teachers, when having been in contact with infected pupils, had major consequences for the teachers' private life. Finally, the sustainability of initiatives to keep a physical distance was challenged by implications related to the possibility of comforting younger schoolchildren and teaching activities demanding proximity to pupils. CONCLUSIONS: It should be ensured that schools have the resources needed to hinder spread of virus while delivering high quality teaching. In addition, our findings suggest that school leaders clarify the prioritization between preventive initiatives and core tasks, and inform about responsibilities and academic expectations.

Although several models have been proposed concerning the mechanism by which the 5-substituents regulate codon-reading properties of the tRNAs, none could explain recent results of the experiments utilizing well-characterized modification-deficient strains of Escherichia coli. Here, we first summarize previous studies on the codon-reading properties of tRNA molecules with a U derivative at the wobble position. Then, we propose a hypothetical mechanism of the reading of the G-ending codons by such tRNA molecules that could explain the experimental results. The hypothesis supposes unconventional base pairs between a protonated form of the modified uridines and the G at the third position of the codon stabilized by two direct hydrogen bonds between the bases. The hypothesis also addresses differences between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic decoding systems.","output":"SURVEY AND SUMMARY: Roles of 5-substituents of tRNA wobble uridines in the recognition of purine-ending codons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: As the prevalence of age-related sensory impairment increases, more evidence emerges on the association between uni-sensory and cognitive impairment (CI) in older adults. However, the link between CI and concurrent hearing and vision impairment (referred to as dual sensory impairment/DSI) is not well-understood, and this combined effect may be additive or multiplicative. Moreover, the existing evidence on CI in older adults with DSI is scattered and limited. Through this systematic scoping review, we aim to map existing evidence on CI in older adults with DSI, and to summarize what is known about the prevalence, incidence and risk factors of CI, and tools used to screen or assess CI in older adults with DSI. Methods and Analysis: We will use the Joanna Briggs Institute framework to perform the review. Eleven databases [MEDLINE, CINAHL/EBSCO, EMBASE, Mednar, WorldWideScience, PsycEXTRA, OAIster, OpenGrey (SIGLE), Global Health, PsycINFO, and Web of Science] and clinical trial registries (ISRCTN Registry, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov) will be searched. Study selection will be completed using Covidence, and data will be extracted using an a priori data extraction tool. To be included, studies had to be peer-reviewed, had older adults with DSI as the focal population, and are related to CI. Data will be presented using a narrative summary with emphasis on implications for future research and practice. Discussion: Reliable cognitive screening is of the utmost importance for prevention and treatment of CI within DSI population. The study findings will have significant implications for health services delivery and policy research. The summarized findings on the prevalence, incidence, associated risk factors, and CI screening and assessment tools will inform geriatric care. The review will also document knowledge gaps on CI in the DSI population and identify areas of interest for future studies. Ethics and Dissemination: The scoping study, being a review of existing documents, does not require ethics approval. The findings will be disseminated with relevant stakeholders using knowledge translation activities such as scientific presentations and publications. We intend to use the findings to conduct a Delphi study to evaluate which CI tools are suitable for older population with DSI.","output":"Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults With Concurrent Hearing and Vision Impairment: A Systematic Scoping Review Protocol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The conduct of respiratory droplets is the basis of the study to reduce the spread of a virus in society. The pandemic suffered in early 2020 due to COVID-19 shows the lack of research on the evaporation and fate of droplets exhaled in the environment. The current study, attempts to provide solution through computational fluid dynamics techniques based on a multiphase state with the help of EulerianCLagrangian techniques to the activity of respiratory droplets. A numerical study has shown how the behavior of droplets of pure water exhaled in the environment after a sneeze or cough have a dynamic equal to the experimental curve of Wells. The droplets of saliva have been introduced as a saline solution. Considering the mass transferred and the turbulence created, the results has showed that the ambient temperature and relative humidity are parameters that significantly affect the evaporation process, and therefore to the fate. Evaporation time tends to be of a higher value when the temperature affecting the environment is lower. With constant parameters of particle diameter and ambient temperature, an increase in relative humidity increases the evaporation time. A larger particle diameter is consequently transported at a greater distance, since the opposite force it affects is the weight. Finally, a neural network-based model is presented to predict particle evaporation time.","output":"Computational characterization of the behavior of a saliva droplet in a social environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Decrease of the nociceptive stimulation induced by laryngoscopy could be an advantage for patients without risk of difficult intubation. The present study aimed to compare the difference in nociceptive stimulation between the use of a conventional laryngoscope or of a videolaryngoscope. Amount of nociception was assessed indirectly using the peak remifentanil concentration determined by a closed-loop administration of propofol and remifentanil with bispectral index (BIS) as the input signal (target 50). METHODS A prospective single-center randomized study was performed including surgical patients without predictable risk of difficult mask ventilation or of difficult tracheal intubation. Forty consecutive surgery patients were randomly assigned to CL group (conventional laryngoscope) or VL group (McGrath Mac videolaryngoscope). Induction of anesthesia was performed automatically using the closed-loop system and myorelaxation with atracurium. The allocation was revealed just before tracheal intubation. The primary outcome was the peak plasma remifentanil concentration observed during the 5-minute period which followed intubation. RESULTS Sixteen patients in the CL group and 11 in the VL group were analyzed. Plasmatic remifentanil and propofol concentrations were similar in both groups either before tracheal intubation or during the 5 minutes following intubation. There was a nonsignificant between-group difference (P = .09) for the peak concentration of remifentanil. A comparable result was observed for other outcomes except for the heart rate which increased in the CL group. CONCLUSION Use of the videolaryngoscope McGrath Mac did not reduce the nociceptive stimulation induced during intubation as evaluated by the automatically administered remifentanil concentration.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to assess and rank the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on inflammatory factors, uremic toxins, and gastrointestinal symptoms (GI symptoms) in ESRD patients undergoing dialysis. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials were searched from the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials databases, from their inception until 4 September 2021. Random-effect model were used to obtain all estimated outcomes in network meta-analysis (NMA). Effect estimates were presented as mean differences (Mean  SD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The comprehensive effects of all treatments were ranked by the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies involved 1,106 participants were included. Prebiotics were superior in decreasing Interleukin-6 (IL-6; SMD C0.74, 95% CI [C1.32, C0.16]) and tumor-necrosis factor- (TNF-; SMD C0.59, 95% CI [C1.09, C0.08]), synbiotics were more effective in declining C-reactive protein (CRP; SMD C0.69, 95% CI [C1.14, C0.24]) and endotoxin (SMD C0.83, 95% CI [C1.38, C0.27]).

This article presents the perceived barriers and enablers in using social media for consumer engagement derived from an interview study with public hospital stakeholders. METHODS Semi-structured interviews with 26 Australian hospital service providers and consumer representatives. Data were analysed using a deductive content analysis method. RESULTS Data were collected between October 2019 and April 2020. Facebook was the platform most commonly used for consumer engagement activities. Barriers and enablers to social media-based consumer engagement were identified. The barrier themes were (1) fears and concerns; (2) lack of skills and resources for social media engagement; (3) lack of organisational processes and support; and (4) problems with social media platforms and the changing social media landscape. The enabler themes were: (1) hospitals facilitating access and use; (2) making discussions safe; (3) cultivating a social media community; and (4) building on success. CONCLUSION Using social media to facilitate consumer engagement in hospital service design and QI activities is feasible and acceptable to service providers and consumers. Hospitals and their executives can create a supportive environment for social media-based engagement activities through developing clear governance systems and providing training and support to all users. Consumers need to be involved in co-designing social media-based activities and determining which forms of engagement are accessible and acceptable. For some consumers and service providers, barriers such as a lack of resources and distrust of social media companies might mean that social media-based engagement will be less acceptable for them. Because of this it is important that hospitals provide complementary methods of engagement (eg, face-to-face) alongside social media-based methods.","output":"Social Media as a Tool for Consumer Engagement in Hospital Quality Improvement and Service Design: Barriers and Enablers for Implementation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: On December 12, 2019 a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19). At 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313 and the number of Covid-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle. Methods: : Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among Italian population aged 12 years. The study instrument comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment);anthropometrics data (reported weight and height);dietary habits information (Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, number of meals/day);lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, smoke habit, sleep quality and physical activity). The survey was conducted from 5 th to 24 th of April 2020. Results: : the perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population;3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking;a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents;the population group aged 18-30 years resulted to have a higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet when compared to the youngers and the olders (p=0.000;p=0.000);15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic purchasing groups for fruit and vegetables, especially in North and Center Italy, where BMI values were lower. Conclusions: : In the present study, we provided for the first time data on the Italian population lifestyle, eating habits and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet pattern during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Pertussis booster vaccines (available as combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, Tdap) uptake is relatively low in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Increasing Tdap vaccination is a strategy that may aid healthy aging. AREAS COVERED Epidemiology data, including notification reports from 6 advanced economies in Asia (Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan) were reviewed to assess the pertussis disease burden and identify high-risk groups. Existing Tdap vaccination recommendations were reviewed. Current vaccination practices were discussed to benchmark and identify barriers and success factors for Tdap booster vaccination in older adults. EXPERT OPINION The available evidence supports Tdap vaccination at an individual level for the prevention of pertussis, along with tetanus and diphtheria in those aged 65+ years, together with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. Data gaps need to be filled to support development of national/supranational recommendations for pertussis booster vaccination. Groups at higher risk of pertussis infection and its complications, including those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, could be considered as priority groups.

Human rotavirus (HRV) detection was performed by direct electron microscopy (EM), conventional immune electron microscopy (IEM) and/or solid phase immune electron microscopy ( SPIEM ); rotavirus antigens were detected by indirect double-antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA and HRV isolation was attempted in MA-104 or LLC-MK2 cell cultures. HRV serology was done on paired sera from all the patients by the indirect immunoperoxidase antibody (IPA) technique for HRV IgG determination, and by an indirect ELISA method using a purified HRV Wa strain as a solid phase. HRV particles were detected by EM and/or IEM in 53 cases (41.7%) and by SPIEM in 5 additional cases; HRV antigens were demonstrated by indirect DAS ELISA in the same 53 cases, whereas 40 cases (31.4%) were positive for HRV isolation in cell cultures. Sixty-four patients (50.3%) seroconverted by IPA and ELISA, including all the cases (58) positive for rotavirus detection in stools and 6 additional cases. Thus, SPIEM appears to be the most sensitive technique for detecting a few virus particles in stool specimens, but HRV serology is the most sensitive method for diagnosing HRV infections retrospectively, when paired sera are drawn at an appropriate time.

In the present study, we successfully cultured porcine microglia and demonstrated that microglia could support PRRSV infection and replication in vitro. We further showed that HP-PRRSV infection significantly up-regulated the key inflammatory factors including IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, IL-12, IL-8, CXCL10, MCP-1, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 in cultured microglia as well as in the CNS of HP-PRRSV-infected pigs. The transcription factors NF-B and AP-1, which are widely reported to regulate cytokine and chemokine productions, were activated by HP-PRRSV infection in microglia. Meanwhile, we found that HP-PRRSV induced cellular ROS formation in microglia and ROS scavenger was proved to significantly abolish the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-8), suggesting that ROS are crucial for pro-inflammatory gene production. Importantly, incubation with supernatants from HP-PRRSV-infected microglia cell culture remarkably induced SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell death.

Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can cause infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and trigger neurological symptoms that include headache, nausea and vomiting, mental confusion and loss of smell or taste. These findings reveal that Coronaviruses have neurological tropism and neuroinvasive capacity. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain tissue possibly occurs through the systemic circulation as reported in patients affected by SARS-CoV. Evidence highlights similarity between the SARS-CoV genome and SARS-CoV-2 and that both interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) located in the brain tissue of infected patients. Hence, the presence of ACE2 is likely in the CNS to mediate the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into neural tissue. Our hypothesis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can cause encephalitis through the production of inflammatory mediators and activation of immune system cells resulting from the interaction of the ACE2 receptor with the viral Spike protein that causes an increase in angiotensin II. This mechanism has the ability to activate immune system cells by exacerbating stimuli at the angiotensin 2 receptor (AT2R). Thus, it leads to a status of brain injury preceded by vascular damage and destruction of the blood-brain barrier, making it responsible for the installation of acute inflammation.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-mediated encephalitis: role of AT2R receptors in the blood-brain barrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper addresses the subject of Movie Recommendation Systems, focusing on two of the most well-known filtering techniques, Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering The first approach proposes a supervised probabilistic Bayesian model that forms recommendations based on the previous evaluations of other movies the user has watched The second approach composes an unsupervised learning technique that forms clusters of users, using the K-Means algorithm, based on their preference of different movie genres, as it is expressed through their ratings Both of the above approaches are compared to each other as well as to a basic method known as Weighted Sum, which makes predictions based on the cosine similarity and the euclidean distance between users and movies In addition, Content-based Filtering is implemented through K-Means clustering techniques that focus on identifying the resemblance between movie plots The first approach clusters movies according to the Tf/Idf weighting scheme, applying weights to the terms of movie plots The latter identifies the likeness between movie plots, utilizing the BM25 algorithm The efficiency of the above methods is calculated through the Accuracy metric","output":"Improving Movie Recommendation Systems Filtering by Exploiting User-Based Reviews and Movie Synopses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study examines the #BoomerRemover hashtag on Twitter to understand discourses of intergenerational conflict and unity that emerged during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study used an inductive-dominant qualitative content analysis to examine 536 tweets collected between March 9 and April 9, 2020 under #BoomerRemover. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed five forms of conflictive generational discourse: derogatory endorsement of the #BoomerRemover moniker, conflict regarding the nature and origins of the moniker, conflict surrounding the virus, political conflict, and generational jabs. Two forms of intergenerationally unifying discourse were identified: implicit and explicit pleas for connectivity. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The analysis of discourse under #BoomerRemover revealed more nuanced expressions surrounding generational cohorts than widely reported in media outlets. Some users tweeted the hashtag in ways that reflected conflict, with #BoomerRemover acting as a vector through which stereotypes were perpetuated and magnified. However, a number of users tweeted the hashtag to call for intergenerational connectivity, highlighting the complexity of online discourse.

It is present in eminent diagnostic manuals such as DSM and ICD, as well as in the discussion on mental disorders in philosophy of psychiatry. Recent demotion of harm in the definition of mental disorders in DSM-5 shows a general trend towards reducing the significance of harm when thinking about the nature of mental disorders. In this paper, we defend the relevance of the notion of harm in the characterization of mental disorder against some of these attacks. We approach this issue by using the method of conceptual explication pioneered by Rudolf Carnap. Within this framework, we argue that keeping the notion of harm not only helps to discriminate what is pathological from the nonpathological but also prevents potential misuses of psychiatric authority.","output":"Reconsidering harm in psychiatric manuals within an explicationist framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: Biomedical research findings are typically disseminated through publications. To simplify access to domain-specific knowledge while supporting the research community, several biomedical databases devote significant effort to manual curation of the literaturea labor intensive process. The first step toward biocuration requires identifying articles relevant to the specific area on which the database focuses. Thus, automatically identifying publications relevant to a specific topic within a large volume of publications is an important task toward expediting the biocuration process and, in turn, biomedical research. Current methods focus on textual contents, typically extracted from the title-and-abstract. Notably, images and captions are often used in publications to convey pivotal evidence about processes, experiments and results. RESULTS: We present a new document classification scheme, using both image and caption information, in addition to titles-and-abstracts. To use the image information, we introduce a new image representation, namely Figure-word, based on class labels of subfigures. We use word embeddings for representing captions and titles-and-abstracts. To utilize all three types of information, we introduce two information integration methods. The first combines Figure-words and textual features obtained from captions and titles-and-abstracts into a single larger vector for document representation; the second employs a meta-classification scheme. Our experiments and results demonstrate the usefulness of the newly proposed Figure-words for representing images. Moreover, the results showcase the value of Figure-words, captions and titles-and-abstracts in providing complementary information for document classification; these three sources of information when combined, lead to an overall improved classification performance.

We hypothesis radiomics features from the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images can assess possibilities of disease exacerbation.Methods: A total of 1,245 patients (685 moderate and 560 severe patients) were enrolled in a retrospective study. We proposed 3D V-Net to segment adrenal glands in onset CT images automatically, and periadrenal fat was obtained using inflation operation around the adrenal gland. Next, we built a clinical model (CM), three radiomics models (adrenal gland model [AM], periadrenal fat model [PM], and fusion of adrenal gland and periadrenal fat model [FM]), and radiomics nomogram (RN) after radiomics features extracted.Findings: The auto-segmentation framework yielded a dice value of 0.79 in the training set.

Moreover, how these aerosols might increase the risk of exposure to this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 RNA).

In the void created by a lack of clinical experience with COVID-19, artificial intelligence (AI) may be an important tool to bolster clinical judgment and decision making. However, a lack of clinical data restricts the design and development of such AI tools, particularly in preparation for an impending crisis or pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of a patients-like-me framework to predict the deterioration of patients with COVID-19 using a retrospective cohort of patients with similar respiratory diseases. METHODS: Our framework used COVID-19Clike cohorts to design and train AI models that were then validated on the COVID-19 population. The COVID-19Clike cohorts included patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, unspecified pneumonia, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at an academic medical center from 2008 to 2019. In total, 15 training cohorts were created using different combinations of the COVID-19Clike cohorts with the ARDS cohort for exploratory purposes. In this study, two machine learning models were developed: one to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 hours for each hospitalized day, and one to predict all-cause mortality at the time of admission. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. We established model interpretability by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scores to identify important features. RESULTS: Compared to the COVID-19Clike cohorts (n=16,509), the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=159) were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of patients of Hispanic ethnicity, a lower proportion of patients with smoking history, and fewer patients with comorbidities (P<.001). Patients with COVID-19 had a lower IMV rate (15.1 versus 23.2, P=.02) and shorter time to IMV (2.9 versus 4.1 days, P<.001) compared to the COVID-19Clike patients. In the COVID-19Clike training data, the top models achieved excellent performance (AUROC>0.90). Validating in the COVID-19 cohort, the top-performing model for predicting IMV was the XGBoost model (AUROC=0.826) trained on the viral pneumonia cohort. Similarly, the XGBoost model trained on all 4 COVID-19Clike cohorts without ARDS achieved the best performance (AUROC=0.928) in predicting mortality. Important predictors included demographic information (age), vital signs (oxygen saturation), and laboratory values (white blood cell count, cardiac troponin, albumin, etc). Our models had class imbalance, which resulted in high negative predictive values and low positive predictive values.

Unlike other bdelloid and, more generally, eukaryotic transposable elements (TEs), it exhibits similarity to prokaryotic insertion sequences (ISs).

Despite the apparent intactness of the single open reading frame coding for a DDE transposase and the perfect identity of its 213-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), the element is present in only one copy per diploid genome. It does not exhibit any detectable levels of transcription, so that its transposase gene appears to be silent in the bdelloid host. Although horizontal transfers of TEs between kingdoms are not known to happen in nature, it appears likely that IS5_Av underwent integration into the A. vaga genome relatively recently, but was not successful in adapting to the new host and failed to increase in copy number. Alternatively, it might be the only known member of a novel eukaryotic DNA TE superfamily which is so rare that its other members, if any, have not yet been identified in eukaryotic genomes sequenced to date.","output":"A Single-Copy IS5-Like Transposon in the Genome of a Bdelloid Rotifer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Experience with the endovascular treatment of middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms by flow diverter devices (FDD) is still limited.

METHODS From February 2010 to December 2013, 14 patients (10 women; mean age 59 years) with 15 small MCA aneurysms were treated with FDD. All procedures were performed with the Pipeline embolization device (PED). RESULTS Complete occlusion was obtained in 12/15 aneurysms (80%) and partial occlusion in 3 (20%). Among 13 aneurysms with a side branch, this was patent at the angiographic control in 4 cases, showed decreased filling in 6, and was occluded in 3 (with neurological deficits in 2).

However, little is known regarding the risk for those not admitted to hospital. We therefore examined prescription drug and health-care use after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using the Danish prescription, patient, and health insurance registries. All individuals with a positive or negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark between Feb 27 and May 31, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of interest were delayed acute complications, chronic disease, hospital visits due to persisting symptoms, and prescription drug use. We used data from non-hospitalised SARS-CoV-2-positive and matched SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals from 2 weeks to 6 months after a SARS-CoV-2 test to obtain propensity score-weighted risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs) for initiation of 14 drug groups and 27 hospital diagnoses indicative of potential post-acute effects. We also calculated prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall health-care use. This study is registered in the EU Electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EUPAS37658). FINDINGS: 10 498 eligible individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark from Feb 27 to May 31, 2020, of whom 8983 (856%) were alive and not admitted to hospital 2 weeks after their positive test. The matched SARS-CoV-2-negative reference population not admitted to hospital consisted of 80 894 individuals. Compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were not at an increased risk of initiating new drugs (RD <01%) except bronchodilating agents, specifically short-acting ?2-agonists (117 [17%] of 6935 positive individuals vs 743 [13%] of 57 206 negative individuals; RD +04% [95% CI 01-07]; RR 132 [109-160]) and triptans (33 [04%] of 8292 vs 198 [03%] of 72 828; RD +01% [00-03]; RR 155 [107-225]). There was an increased risk of receiving hospital diagnoses of dyspnoea (103 [12%] of 8676 vs 499 [07%] of 76 728; RD +06% [04-08]; RR 200 [162-248]) and venous thromboembolism (20 [02%] of 8785 vs 110 [01%] of 78 872; RD +01% [00-02]; RR 177 [109-286]) for SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with negative individuals, but no increased risk of other diagnoses. Prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall general practitioner visits (118 [95% CI 115-122]) and outpatient hospital visits (110 [105-116]), but not hospital admission, showed increases among SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals.

Serological analysis was applied for assessing some metric epidemiological aspects of the infection and its transmissibility among people who were in contact with SARA-CoV-2 patients. Methods: In this contact tracing prospective cohort study, 453 contact cases of forty COVID 19 patients were followed for three months. SARS-CoV-2 patients were diagnosed by real time polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. The history of infectiousness was detected by serological testing of IgG and IgM. Trained expert team completed two questionnaires and blood samples were taken by experts in laboratory. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Ver.21) and R software. Some important epidemiological characteristics of the infection were calculated. Results: Mean age of SARS-CoV-2 patients and contact cases were 53.018.2 and 30.819.3 years, respectively. Overall R 0 of the infection was 2.56. Household and non-household secondary attack rates (SAR) were 20% (95%CI;12.7 C 27.3) and 11.3% (95%CI;6.1-16.5), respectively. Transmission probability in each contact was 0.0205 and the serial interval was 6.44.6 (95% CI;5.2C7.6) days. SAR among contact cases who exposed asymptomatic primary cases (28%, 95%CI;10-46%) was higher than that (13.8%, 95%CI;9.4-18.2) among contact cases exposing to symptomatic patients. Conclusions: We concluded a herd immunity between 60 and 65% is needed in human communities.

Moreover, a high risk of allograft damage, possibly leading to allograft loss, has been reported. In contrast, data regarding the clinical course of infected pediatric KT recipients are scarce. Herein, we describe the clinical features, management and outcome of 2 deceased-donor KT pediatric recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, occurred during early and late post-transplant period. Method(s): The two cases concerned a 13-year-old boy with Senior-Loken syndrome and an 18-year-old girl, with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, who received KT 3 months and 7 years before SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively. The boy had received induction therapy with basiliximab, followed by triple maintenance therapy, including oral cyclosporine (70 mg twice per day), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (500 mg twice per day) and daily methylprednisolone (10 mg), while the girl's current immunosuppressive treatment consisted in tacrolimus (1.5 mg twice per day), MMF (750 mg twice per day) and methylprednisolone (8 mg) every other day. Allograft function was stable in both patients. Result(s): Close contact with confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in both patients. The boy was asymptomatic, while the girl presented sore throat, tiredness and fever with maximum temperature 38.6 C, which lasted for 48 hours. Chest X-ray was normal in both patients. Initial laboratory findings were common in both patients and included mild lymphocytopenia (920/muL and 868/muL respectively), normal C-reactive protein and liver enzyme levels, and stable serum creatinine and urea levels. MMF was discontinued, while steroid dose was increased by twice in both patients. Due to fever, a 3-day course of azithromycin was administered to the female patient. Normalization of total lymphocyte count permitting the progressive re-initialization of MMF and reduction of steroid dose was observed at 14th and 5th day of the disease respectively. Graft function remained stable in both patients. Conclusion(s): The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection during both early and late post-transplant period seems favorable in pediatric KT recipients.

Prior research by the Tissue Directory and Coordination Centre (TDCC) indicated that researchers, particularly those in industry, face many barriers in accessing patient samples. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic to the UK produced an immediate and extreme shockwave, which impacted on the ability to undertake all crucial translational research. As a national coordination centre, the TDCC is tasked with improving efficiency in the biobanking sector. Thus, we took responsibility to identify and coordinate UK tissue sample collection organisations (biobanks) able to collect COVID-19-related samples for researchers between March and September 2020. FINDINGS: Almost a third of UK biobanks were closed during the first wave of the UK COVID-19 pandemic. Of the remainder, 43% had limited capabilities while 26% maintained normal activity. Of the nationally prioritised COVID-19 interventional studies, just three of the five that responded to questioning were collecting human samples. Of the 41 requests for COVID-19 samples received by the TDCC, only four could be fulfilled due to a lack of UK coordinated strategy. Meanwhile, in the background there are numerous reports that sample collections in the UK remain largely underutilised. CONCLUSION: The response to a pandemic demands high level co-ordinated research responses to reduce mortality. Our study highlights the lack of efficiency and coordination between human sample collections and clinical trials across the UK. UK sample access is not working for researchers, clinicians or patients.

One of the most stringent lockdowns in the world was implemented in India. With the entire healthcare system being stretched, emergency orthopaedic services also take a hit. We studied the trends in patient presentation, testing, management, and restructuring of doctors at a tertiary care orthopaedic centre and compared them with the data from the same time period the previous year (2019). METHOD: Data was collected separately for all the 5 different phases of lockdown and unlock, as well as for the same duration of months in 2019, and was analysed for epidemiological trends. RESULTS: A rapid fall in the total number of cases was seen during the lockdown, followed by a skewed rise during the unlock. Forearm, wrist, and hip fractures were the most common fractures. Once nucleic acid testing of all patients intended to be admitted was started, a steep rise in coronavirus positivity was seen. There was a reduction in the total number of cases compared to 2019, but it was not as significant as would have been expected due to the complete standstill of activity during the lockdown. CONCLUSION: During a pandemic, with the healthcare system under a crisis of workforce and infrastructure, there needs to be a separate task force for catering to orthopaedic emergencies since all fractures cannot be managed conservatively and the numbers of trauma-related patients did not show a stark fall as compared to normal months of last year.

UCancellation takes less than 7 minutes to complete, is automatically scored, has multiple forms to allow repeated testing, and is compatible with a variety of iOS and Android devices. Here we report the results of a study that examined parallel-test reliability and convergent validity of UCancellation in a sample of 104 college students.

METHODS XRCC1 rs25487 was genotyped in lymphocytes from serial peripheral blood samples. Severe RIL was defined as absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <0.3109 cells/L. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify independent risk factors, which were then used to group patients according to risk of severe RIL. RESULTS Univariate analysis of the 178 patients in this analysis showed that older age, larger tumors, higher lung V5 and mean lung dose, and higher heart V5 and mean heart dose were associated with severe RIL during treatment (P<0.05). The XRCC1 rs25487 AA genotype was also associated with increased risk of severe RIL during treatment (AA vs. others: hazard ratio [HR] =1.065, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.089-2.500, P = 0.018). Multivariate analyses showed that older age (HR=1.031, 95% CI 1.009-1.054, P=0.005), lung V5 (HR=1.039, 95% CI 1.023-1.055, P<0.001), and AA genotype (AA vs. others, HR=1.768, 95% CI 1.165-2.684, P=0.007) were independently associated with higher incidence of severe RIL. These three risk factors (age 56 years, lung V5 51% and XRCC1 rs25487 AA) distinguished patients at different risk of developing severe RIL (P<0.001).

The effective reproduction number R(e)(t) is a critical measure of epidemic potential. R(e)(t) can be calculated in near real time using an incidence time series and the generation time distribution: the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. In calculating R(e)(t), the generation time distribution is often approximated by the serial interval distribution: the time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair. However, while generation time must be positive by definition, serial interval can be negative if transmission can occur before symptoms, such as in covid-19, rendering such an approximation improper in some contexts. Methods. We developed a method to infer the generation time distribution from parametric definitions of the serial interval and incubation period distributions. We then compared estimates of R(e)(t) for covid-19 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada using: negative-permitting versus non-negative serial interval distributions, versus the inferred generation time distribution. Results. We estimated the generation time of covid-19 to be Gamma-distributed with mean 3.99 and standard deviation 2.96 days. Relative to the generation time distribution, non-negative serial interval distribution caused overestimation of R(e)(t) due to larger mean, while negative-permitting serial interval distribution caused underestimation of R(e)(t) due to larger variance. Implications. Approximation of the generation time distribution of covid-19 with non-negative or negative-permitting serial interval distributions when calculating R(e)(t) may result in over or underestimation of transmission potential, respectively.","output":"Estimating effective reproduction number using generation time versus serial interval, with application to covid-19 in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: Public Trust and Guiding Ethics Where Ventilators Equal Lives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed the landscape of medical care and the healthcare system needs to quickly adapt in order to continue providing optimal medical care to hospitalized patients in an efficient, effective, and safe manner.

Experimental studies using such norms typically assume invariance of normative likelihoods across age and historical time. We replicate previous findings such that exemplar frequency correlations suggest moderate stability in generated category members between age groups and cohorts for many, but not all, categories. Further, analyses of rank-order correlations highlight that the traditional measure of typicality may not capture all aspects of typicality, namely that for some categories there is high consistency in the frequency of exemplars across age groups and/or norms, but the ordering of those exemplars differs significantly.

Furthermore, a total of 91 SARS-CoV-2-IgG-CLIA-positive and 91 SARS-CoV-2-IgG-CLIA-negative postpandemic sera were tested for anti-DENV-IgG using the NovaLisa ELISA kit. The DENV-IgG-positive sera resulted in five positives and 85 negatives for SARS-CoV-2-IgG. Similarly, the DENV-IgG-negative sera also resulted in 5 positives and 85 negatives for SARS-CoV-2-IgG. No statistically significant difference in specificity between the DENV-IgG-positive and DENV-IgG-negative sera was found (p value = 1.00). The SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive sera displayed 43 positives, 47 negatives, and 1 equivocal for DENV-IgG, whereas the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative sera resulted in 50 positives, 40 negatives, and 1 equivocal for DENV-IgG. No statistically significant difference in the proportion that is DENV-IgG positive between the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive and SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative sera (p value = 0.58). In conclusion, there is a low risk of serological cross-reactivity between the DENV and SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies when using advanced detection assays.","output":"Low Risk of Serological Cross-Reactivity between the Dengue Virus and SARS-CoV-2-IgG Antibodies Using Advanced Detection Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data science is an interdisciplinary field that applies numerous techniques, such as machine learning (ML), neural networks (NN) and artificial intelligence (AI), to create value, based on extracting knowledge and insights from available 'big' data [...].","output":"Data Science in Healthcare: COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For four decades the NIH Guidelines have served as the framework for the oversight of research with recombinant and synthetic nucleic acid molecules.

AREAS COVERED The authors discuss key experimental mammalian models and clinical trials. They provide an evaluation of evolving therapeutics in sepsis and how they have built upon past and current treatments. Relevant literature was derived from a PubMed search spanning 1987-2020. EXPERT OPINION Given the complex nature of sepsis and the elicited immune response, it is not surprising that a single cure-all therapeutic intervention, which is capable of effectively and reliably improving patient outcomes has failed to emerge. Innovative approaches seek to address not only the disease process but modify underlying patient factors.

METHODS: During MarchCAugust 2020, approximately 1000 serum specimens were collected monthly from each region and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a well-validated algorithm. Regional seroprevalence estimates were weighted based on demographic differences compared with the general population. Seroprevalence was compared with reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case rates over time. RESULTS: For all regions, seroprevalence was <1.0% in March 2020. New York, New York, experienced the biggest increase (peak seroprevalence, 15.8% in May). All other regions experienced modest increases in seroprevalence (1%C2% in MayCJune to 2%C4% in JulyCAugust). Seroprevalence was higher in younger, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic donors. Temporal increases in donor seroprevalence correlated with reported case rates in each region. In August, 1.3C5.6 estimated cumulative infections (based on seroprevalence data) per COVID-19 case were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in seroprevalence were found in all regions, with the largest increase in New York. Seroprevalence was higher in non-Hispanic black and Hispanic than in non-Hispanic white blood donors. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing of blood donor samples can be used to estimate the seroprevalence in the general population by region and demographic group. The methods derived from the RESPONSE seroprevalence study served as the basis for expanding SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveillance to all 50 states and Puerto Rico.","output":"Use of US Blood Donors for National Serosurveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibodies: Basis for an Expanded National Donor Serosurveillance Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study semi-algorithms to synthesise the constraints under which a Parametric Timed Automaton satisfies some liveness requirement.

The WHO and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued interim clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but there is limited data on the virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19. Methods: A total of 50 patients with severe COVID-19 were divided into good and poor recovery groups. The dynamic viral shedding and serological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were explored. The risk factors associated with poor recovery and lung lesion resolutions were identified. In addition, the potential relationships among the viral shedding, the pro-inflammatory response, and lung lesion evolutions were characterized. Results: A total of 58% of the patients had poor recovery and were more likely to have a prolonged interval of viral shedding. The longest viral shedding was 57 days after symptom onset. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid therapy, consolidation on chest computed-tomography (CT), and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive were all associated with poor recovery. Additionally, the odds of impaired lung lesion resolutions were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia, hyperlipemia, and elevated levels of IL-4 and ferritin. Finally, viral shedding and proinflammatory responses were closely correlated with lung lesion evolutions on chest CT. Conclusions Patients with severe COVID-19 have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed intermittent viral shedding. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid usage, and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive might be utilized as predicative factors for the patients with poor recovery.","output":"Virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19: a retrospective observational study in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The globe is currently in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.

We retrospectively investigated the clinical information of confirmed COVID-19 patients from 10 February 2020 to 29 February 2020 in Wuhan Union Hospital.

No single domain of DPAP B is required for delivery to the vacuolar membrane, because removal or replacement of either the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or lumenal domain did not affect the protein's transport to the vacuole. DPAP A was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to non-vacuolar, punctate structures characteristic of the yeast Golgi apparatus. The 118-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is sufficient for retention of the protein in these structures, since replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B with that of DPAP A resulted in an immunolocalization pattern indistinguishable from that of wild type DPAP A. Overproduction of DPAP A resulted in its mislocalization to the vacuole, because cells expressing high levels of DPAP A exhibited vacuolar as well as Golgi staining. Deletion of 22 residues of the DPAP A cytoplasmic domain resulted in mislocalization of the mutant protein to the vacuole. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention, and removal of the retention signal, or saturation of the retention apparatus by overproducing DPAP A, resulted in transport to the vacuole. Like wild type DPAP B, the delivery of mutant membrane proteins to the vacuole was unaffected in the secretory vesicle-blocked sec1 mutant; thus, transport to the vacuole was not via the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis.

Following 507 reported exposures by 43 SARS-CoV-2 positive DSMs, 3 patients were SARS C CoV-2 positive, with a 0.6% cumulative transmission rate. Conclusions: The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 in dental settings was very low for both patients and DSMs. Clinical significance: Our results suggest that routine dental care could be safely provided during the pandemic. Continuous monitoring should be performed due to the emergence of new variants and the vaccination programs.","output":"\\"Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission following exposure during Dental Treatment CA National Cohort Study\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become the most threatening issue to all populations around the world. It is directly and indirectly affecting all of us and thus, is a emergence topic dealt in global health. In order to avoid the infection, various studies have been done and still ongoing. Now having over 141 million cases of COVID19 and causing over 3 million deaths around the world, the tendency of infection and degree severity of the disease shown in different groups of people came up as an issue. Here, we reviewed 21 papers on SNPs related to SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and analyzed the results of them. Methods: The PubMed databases were searched for papers discussing SNPs associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. Clinical studies with human patients and statistically showing relevance of the SNP with virus infection were included. Quality Assessment of all papers were done with Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Results: In the analysis, 21 full-text literatures out of 2956 screened titles and abstracts, including 63496 cases, were included. All were human based clinical studies, some based on certain regions gathered patient data and some based on big databases obtained online. ACE2, TMPRSS2, IFITM3 are the genes mentioned most frequently that are related with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 20 out of 21 studies mentioned one of more of those genes. The relevant genes according to SNPs were also analyzed. rs12252-C, rs143936283, rs2285666, rs41303171, and rs35803318 are the SNPs that were mentioned at least twice in two different studies. Conclusions: We found that ACE2, TMPRSS2, IFITM3 are the major genes that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mentioned SNPs were all related to one or more of the above mentioned genes. There were discussions on certain SNPs that increased the infection severity to certain ethinic groups more than the others. However, as there is limited follow up and data due to shortage of time history of the disease, studies may be limited.","output":"A Systematic Review on Papers That Study on SNPs That Affect SARS-CoV-2 Infection & COVID-19 Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study whether the trading behavior of corporate insiders provides additional information to the market, after controlling for the public information integrated by sophisticated investors.

SARS-CoV2 virus-like particles (VLPs) offer a BSL-1, replication-incompetent system that can be used to evaluate virus assembly and virus-cell entry processes in tractable cell culture conditions. Here, we describe a SARS-CoV2 VLP system that utilizes nanoluciferase (Nluc) fragment complementation to track assembly and entry. We utilized the system in two ways. Firstly, we investigated the requirements for VLP assembly. VLPs were produced by concomitant synthesis of three viral membrane proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and matrix (M), along with the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid (N). We discovered that VLP production and secretion were highly dependent on N proteins. N proteins from related betacoronaviruses variably substituted for the homologous SARS-CoV2 N, and chimeric betacoronavirus N proteins effectively supported VLP production if they contained SARS-CoV2 N carboxy-terminal domains (CTD). This established the CTDs as critical features of virus particle assembly. Secondly, we utilized the system by investigating virus-cell entry. VLPs were produced with Nluc peptide fragments appended to E, M, or N proteins, with each subsequently inoculated into target cells expressing complementary Nluc fragments. Complementation into functional Nluc was used to assess virus-cell entry. We discovered that each of the VLPs were effective at monitoring virus-cell entry, to various extents, in ways that depended on host cell susceptibility factors. Overall, we have developed and utilized a VLP system that has proven useful in identifying SARS-CoV2 assembly and entry features.","output":"Assembly and Entry of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2): Evaluation Using Virus-Like Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The morbidity and mortality of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is considerable. We studied the use of whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) in this patient cohort. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit and requiring mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were randomized to 1 Gy whole-lung LDRT or sham irradiation (sham-RT). Treatment group allocation was concealed from patients and intensive care unit clinicians, who treated patients according to the current standard of care. Patients were followed for the primary endpoint of ventilator-free days at day 15 postintervention. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, as well as changes in oxygenation and inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were randomized to either whole-lung LDRT or sham-RT between November and December 2020. Patients were generally elderly and comorbid, with a median age of 75 years in both arms. No difference in 15-day ventilator-free days was observed between groups (P = 1.00), with a median of 0 days (range, 0-9) in the LDRT arm and 0 days (range, 0-13) in the sham-RT arm. Overall survival at 28 days was identical at 63.6% (95% confidence interval, 40.7%-99.5%) in both arms (P = .69).

Our study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of COVID-19 + ve cancer patients seen by PC. METHODS: Advanced cancer patients seen as a consult by PC between June 15 and September 25, 2020, at MD Anderson Cancer Center were eligible for the study. We evaluated the patient demographics, clinical characteristics including symptoms(ESAS), delirium(MDAS), COVID + status prior to, and after PC referral(converters), and type of PC delivery(in person or virtual care). RESULTS: Sixty-six out of 1380 (4.8%) PC consults were COVID-19 + ve: 42 prior to PC (79%), and 14 (21%) were COVID-19 + ve after the PC (converters). COVID-19 + PC patients had lower depression (P = .035), spiritual distress (P = .003), and were more seen frequently virtually (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between COVID-19-ve patients and converters. Converters had higher symptom distress (P = 0.007), lower delirium (P = 0.014), and were referred earlier (P = .011) compared to COVID + PC patients diagnosed prior to PC consult. Overall, patients seen virtually compared in-person by PC were younger (P = 0.02) and had lower delirium (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The burden of COVID-19 + status among patients referred to PC was low. COVID-19 + ve patients had more frequent virtual visits, lower depression, and spiritual distress scores.

But there are signs that non-COVID-19 care use declined during this time period. We examine near real time data from a nationwide electronic healthcare records system that covers over 35 million patients to provide new evidence of how non-COVID-19 acute care and preventive/primary care have been affected during the epidemic. Using event study and difference-in-difference models we find that state closure policies (stay-at-home or non-essential business closures) are associated with large declines in ambulatory visits, with effects differing by type of care. State closure policies reduced overall outpatient visits by about 15-16 percent within two weeks. Outpatient visits for health check-ups and well care experience very large declines during the epidemic, with substantial effects from state closure policies. In contrast, mental health outpatient visits declined less than other care, and appear less affected by state closure policies. We find substitution to telehealth modalities may have played an important role in mitigating the decline in mental health care utilization. Aggregate trends in outpatient visits show a 40% decline after the first week of March 2020, only a portion of which is attributed to state policy. A rebound starts around mid April that does not appear to be explained by state reopening policy.

We examined socioeconomic factors associated with low resilience in women, the relationship of low resilience with psychiatric morbidity, and the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between pandemic-related stress and other coincident psychiatric morbidities. Using a quota-based sample from a national panel, we conducted a web-based survey of 3200 US women in April 2020. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of pandemic-related stress, and coincident depression and anxiety symptoms among those with and without low resilience. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate resilience as a mediator of the relationship between pandemic-related stress and other coincident psychiatric morbidities. Risk factors for low resilience included younger age, lower household income, lower education, unemployment, East/Southeast Asian race, unmarried/unpartnered status, and higher number of medical comorbidities. Low resilience was significantly associated with greater odds of depression symptoms (OR = 3.78, 95% CI [3.10C4.60]), anxiety symptoms (OR = 4.17, 95% CI [3.40C5.11]), and pandemic-related stress (OR = 2.86, 95% CI [2.26C3.26]).

OBJECTIVE: To define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiologic, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based antigen testing. DESIGN: A simple compartmental epidemic model that estimated viral transmission, portrayed disease progression, and forecast resource use, with and without testing. DATA SOURCES: Parameter values and ranges as informed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and published literature. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. population. TIME HORIZON: 60 days. PERSPECTIVE: Societal; costs included testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays. INTERVENTION: Home-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative infections and deaths, number of persons isolated and hospitalized, and total costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Without a testing intervention, the model anticipates 11.6 million infections, 119 000 deaths, and $10.1 billion in costs ($6.5 billion in inpatient care and $3.5 billion in lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing would avert 2.8 million infections and 15 700 deaths, increasing costs by $22.3 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.5 billion) and workdays lost ($14.0 billion), yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $7890 per infection averted and $1 430 000 per death averted. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Outcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios, with large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations. Costs per death averted are roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5 to $17 million). LIMITATIONS: Analysis was restricted to at-home testing. There are uncertainties concerning test performance. CONCLUSION: High-frequency home testing for SARS-CoV-2 with an inexpensive, imperfect test could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost and warrants consideration as part of a national containment strategy.

We determined whether nervus terminalis neurons and their peripheral and central projections should be considered as a potential alternative route from the nose to the brain. Nervus terminalis neurons in postnatal mice were double-labeled with antibodies against ACE2 and two nervus terminalis markers, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT). We show that a small fraction of CHAT-labeled nervus terminalis neurons, and the large majority of GnRH-labeled nervus terminalis neurons with cell bodies in the region between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb express ACE2 and cathepsins B and L.

The evolutionary stable strategies under different conditions of the tripartite evolutionary game are explored, and the effect from different factors on the decision-makings of participants for public health emergencies is also analyzed.

Staying physically active during lockdown is a challenge, especially for the population with a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19 who are still encouraged to maintain social distance until there is a vaccine available. Strategies to avoid physical inactivity, and reduce stress levels can promote cardiovascular protection, and must be considered during COVID-19 time. OBJECTIVES The aim of this paper is to discuss the risks of physical inactivity and stress for the cardiovascular system during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose strategies to protect cardiovascular health. CONCLUSION A home-based training protocol could be an interesting and effective strategy for the population who need to remain physically active and safe at home.","output":"Stress and physical inactivity: two explosive ingredients for the heart in COVID-19 pandemic times."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To investigate the changes in Chinese adults physical activity (PA) behavior and determinants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A total of 1028 adults (aged 19C59 years) were recruited from 127 urban and rural neighborhoods in China using stratified three-stage probability sampling. Data collection was conducted in December 2019 and July 2020. Results: Compared with the data before the pandemic, individuals weekly moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) decreased significantly from 139 min to 120 min, seven months after the outbreak (p = 0.01), with female and rural populations displaying a more significant decrease (p = 0.02). Overall, 13.7% of participants met the PA guidelines (World Health Organization) both before and during the pandemic, while 21.8% met the guidelines only before the pandemic and 18.1% increased their PA and met the PA guidelines during the pandemic. A total of 46.4% did not meet the PA guidelines before or during the pandemic. Determinants of PA behavior change before and during the pandemic included sports skills, self-determined motivation and support from sports organizations. Conclusions: The Chinese adults PA levels decreased significantly from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among the female population. It is suggested that the enhancement of self-determined motivation, improvement of sport skills, and support from sports organizations might be effective in facilitating individuals engagement in PA during the pandemic.","output":"Changes in Chinese Adults Physical Activity Behavior and Determinants before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: In order to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, nation-wide travel restrictions at different levels were implemented in different countries.

In the absence of vaccines that provide complete protection against these viruses, viral surveillance can identify disease burden and target virus-specific preventative measures. Influenza infection, in particular, has significant adverse effects on force readiness. METHODS: We tracked the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center tested for during routine patient care using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen testing. We collected data on the date and location of the testing, as well as the age of the individual tested from two consecutive respiratory viral seasons. RESULTS: During the first year of data compilation (2017-2018), 2556 tests were performed; 342 (13.4%) were positive for influenza A and 119 (4.7%) were positive for influenza B. After influenza, the most common families of viruses identified were rhino/enterovirus (490 [19.2%]). During the second year (2018-2019), 4,458 tests were run; 564 (12.7%) were positive for influenza A and 35 (0.79%) were positive for influenza B, while rhino/enterovirus was identified in 690 (15.4%). Influenza peaked early during the 2017-2018 season and later during the 2018-2019 season. Importantly, during the 2017-2018 season, the vaccine was less effective for the H3N2 strain circulating that year and viral surveillance quickly identified a hospital-specific outbreak and a larger disease burden. This was in contrast to the 2018-2019 vaccine which exhibited higher effectiveness for circulating strains. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the seasonality of respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza. By tracking respiratory viruses in Department of Defense communities, we may be able to predict when influenza may cause the greatest burden for distinct organizational regions and prescribe with greater precision preventative protocols by location, as well as rapidly determine vaccine efficacy. Our current data suggest that when vaccine strains are mismatched, rapid upfront targeting of antivirals may be warranted, but when the vaccine strains are better matched, late season peaks of disease may indicate waning immunity and should be monitored.","output":"Local Respiratory Viral Surveillance Can Focus Public Health Interventions to Decrease Influenza Disease Burden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metastasis to a meningioma is an uncommon phenomenon however reported in the literature.

Studies monitoring individuals in households or schools have helped elucidate the determinants of transmission in small social structures due to advances in statistical modeling; but such an approach has so far largely failed to consider individuals in the wider context they live in. Here, we used an outbreak of chikungunya in a rural community in Bangladesh as a case study to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of risk factors in disease spread. We developed Bayesian data augmentation approaches to account for uncertainty in the source of infection, recall uncertainty, and unobserved infection dates. We found that the probability of chikungunya transmission was 12% [95% credible interval (CI): 8-17%] between household members but dropped to 0.3% for those living 50 m away (95% CI: 0.2-0.5%). Overall, the mean transmission distance was 95 m (95% CI: 77-113 m).

This is a challenge because there are dozens of bacterial and viral species that might be used in a biological attack and many have closely related near-neighbor organisms that are harmless. The biothreat agent, along with its near neighbors, can be thought of as a biothreat cluster or a biocluster for short. The ability to comprehensively detect the important biothreat clusters with resolution sufficient to distinguish the near neighbors with an extremely low false positive rate is required. A technological solution to this problem can be achieved by coupling biothreat group-specific PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The biothreat assay described here detects ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters on the NIAID priority pathogen and HHS/USDA select agent lists. Detection of each of the biothreat clusters was validated by analysis of a broad collection of biothreat organisms and near neighbors prepared by spiking biothreat nucleic acids into nucleic acids extracted from filtered environmental air. Analytical experiments were carried out to determine breadth of coverage, limits of detection, linearity, sensitivity, and specificity. Further, the assay breadth was demonstrated by testing a diverse collection of organisms from each biothreat cluster. The biothreat assay as configured was able to detect all the target organism clusters and did not misidentify any of the near-neighbor organisms as threats. Coupling biothreat cluster-specific PCR to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry simultaneously provides the breadth of coverage, discrimination of near neighbors, and an extremely low false positive rate due to the requirement that an amplicon with a precise base composition of a biothreat agent be detected by mass spectrometry.","output":"Comprehensive Biothreat Cluster Identification by PCR/Electrospray-Ionization Mass Spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reduced mobility due to COVID-19 prevention measures caused major changes in the number and types of orthopedic trauma cases.

RECENT FINDINGS: From a total of 455 titles on COVID-19 and alcohol, 227 abstracts were screened, and 95 articles were reviewed (on November 25th, 2020). The immediate effect was an increase in alcohol related emergencies including alcohol withdrawal, related suicides, and methanol toxicity. Although there are mixed findings with respect to changes in the quantity of drinking, there are reports of binge/heavy drinking during the lockdown as well as relapse postlockdown. Psychological, social, biological, economic and policy-related factors appear to influence the changes in drinking. Although preliminary data suggest no change in alcohol use among persons with comorbid mental illness, findings in this population are presently limited. Among patients with alcohol related liver disease, outcomes appear worse and caution is warranted with the use of medications. Alcohol also appears to increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and complicates its course.Although some nations banned alcohol sales completely during lockdown, others declared it as an essential commodity, resulting in different problems across countries. Alcohol use has added to the burden of the problem particularly among vulnerable groups like the adolescents, elderly, patients with cancer, as well as health professionals. Services for patients with alcohol use disorders have been affected. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on alcohol use, with an increase in alcohol related emergencies, changes in alcohol use patterns, increased risk of contracting COVID-19, effect on alcohol policies and sales, and an effect on vulnerable groups.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic brought challenging times for nurses worldwide. In Brazil, as well as in several countries, nurses are working hard in hospital settings caring for patients infected with the virus, sometimes with unfavourable work environment conditions. METHODS: This study was a convergent embedded mixed methods research. The sample comprised 104 nurses from three Brazilian university hospitals. Data were collected in April-June 2020 from an online questionnaire with a self-reporting Likert scale survey designed to measure the nurses' perceptions of their work environment. Qualitative data in the form of written comments were also collected through an open question. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: The quantitative results showed that the responses to 'I received training on the correct use of personal protective equipment' and 'I am afraid of being infected' items had the best and worst evaluations, respectively. The qualitative findings revealed five themes: feeling of insecurity, lack of personal protective equipment, lack of diagnostic tests, changes in the care flow and fear of the unknown. CONCLUSION: The study has highlighted the challenges faced by hospital nurses while caring for patients with COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND NURSING POLICY: The gaps identified will assist the policymakers and hospital managers in developing policies to enhance the support offered to nurses and improve the care provided to patients with COVID-19 in university hospitals.

However, acute care is often unpopular and sometimes coercive, and the evidence on which models are best for patient experience and outcomes remains surprisingly limited, in part reflecting challenges in conducting studies with people in crisis. Evidence on best ap-proaches to initial assessment and immediate management is particularly lacking, but some innovative models involving extended assessment, brief interventions, and diversifying settings and strategies for providing support are potentially helpful. Acute wards continue to be central in the intensive treatment phase following a crisis, but new approaches need to be developed, evaluated and implemented to reducing coercion, addressing trauma, diversifying treatments and the inpatient workforce, and making decision-making and care collaborative. Intensive home treatment services, acute day units, and community crisis services have supporting evidence in diverting some service users from hospital admission: a greater understanding of how best to implement them in a wide range of contexts and what works best for which service users would be valuable. Approaches to crisis management in the voluntary sector are more flexible and informal: such services have potential to complement and provide valuable learning for statutory sector services, especially for groups who tend to be underserved or disengaged. Such approaches often involve staff with personal experience of mental health crises, who have important potential roles in improving quality of acute care across sectors. Large gaps exist in many low- and middle-income countries, fuelled by poor access to quality mental health care. Responses need to build on a foundation of existing community responses and contextually relevant evidence.

SUMMARY A panel of pharmacy leaders used an evidence- and expert opinion-based approach to define core and aspirational elements of practice that should be established within contemporary health-system pharmacy enterprises by calendar year 2025. Eight domains of an HVPE were identified: Patient Care Services; Business Services; Ambulatory and Specialty Pharmacy Services; Inpatient Operations; Safety and Quality; Pharmacy Workforce; Information Technology, Data, and Information Management; and Leadership. Phase 1 of the project consisted of the development of draft practice statements, performance elements, and supporting evidence for each domain by panelists, followed by a phase 2 in-person meeting for review and development of consensus for statements and performance elements in each domain. During phase 3, the project cochairs and panelists finalized the domain drafts and incorporated them into a full technical report and this summary report. CONCLUSION The HVPE framework is a strategic roadmap to advance pharmacy practice by ensuring safe, effective, and patient-centered medication management and business practices throughout the health-system pharmacy enterprise. Grounded in evidence and expert recommendations, the statements and associated performance elements can be used to identify strategic priorities to improve patient outcomes and add value within health systems.","output":"The high-value pharmacy enterprise framework: Advancing pharmacy practice in health systems through a consensus-based, strategic approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is well established that Escherichia coli represents a powerful tool for the over-expression of human proteins for structure/function studies. In many cases, such as for membrane transporters, the bacterial toxicity or the aggregation of the target protein hamper the expression limiting the application of this tool. The aim of this study was finding the appropriate conditions for the expression of reluctant proteins that is the human neutral amino acid transporters ASCT2 and B0AT1, that have great relevance to human health in cancer therapy and in COVID-19 research, respectively. The cDNAs coding for the proteins of interest were cloned in the pCOLD I vector and different E. coli strains (BL21 codon plus RIL, and RosettaGami2) were cultured in absence or in presence of glucose (0.5-1%), at low temperature (15 C), and low inducer concentrations (10-100 M). Cell growth and protein production were monitored by optical density measurements and western blotting assay, respectively. Even though in different conditions, the expression of both amino acid transporters was obtained.Reducing the growth rate of specific E. coli strains by lowering the temperature and the IPTG concentration, together with the addition of glucose, two reluctant human neutral amino acid transporters have been expressed in E. coli. The results have a potentially great interest in drug discovery since ASCT2 is an acknowledged target of anticancer therapy, and B0AT1 together with ACE2 is part of a receptor for the SARS-Cov-2 RBD proteins.","output":"Low temperature bacterial expression of the neutral amino acid transporters SLC1A5 (ASCT2), and SLC6A19 (B0AT1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problem of respiratory sound classification has received good attention from the clinical scientists and medical researchers community in the last year to the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease.

Their wound dressings were used as a source of inoculating bacteria to create an ex vivo biofilm model in the laboratory with reasonable fidelity to the original microbial state of their wound. The prototype infection detecting wound dressing, which responds to cytolytic toxins secreted by bacteria, was placed on the ex vivo biofilm and the response of the dressing correlated with the clinical decision on the patient's wound infection state. The study illustrated a number of broader issues with clinical BWI diagnosis, notably the absence of objective diagnostic criteria: a 'reference standard' for BWI.

The country's first confirmed positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was on February 18, 2020. Since then, the number of cases has steadily increased in Iran and worldwide. Emergency medical services (EMS) quickly adapted its operations to accommodate a greater number of patients, and it worked to decrease the risk of COVID-19 spread among EMS personnel, given the disease's high transmissibility. METHODS: We evaluated the chief complaint as well as the pattern and number of EMS calls and dispatches during the 28-day intervals before and after the February 18, 2020, COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. RESULTS: EMS calls increased from 355,241 in the pre-outbreak period to 1,589,346 in the post-outbreak period, a 347% increase (p<0.001). EMS dispatches rose more modestly from 82,282 to 99,926, a 21% increase (p<0.001). The average time on telephone hold decreased from 10.6  12.7 seconds pre-outbreak to 9.8  11.8 seconds post-outbreak, a 7% decrease (p<0.001). The average length of call also decreased from 1.32  1.42 minutes pre-outbreak to 1.06  1.28 minutes post-outbreak, a 20% decrease (p<0.001). The highest number of daily dispatches occurred during the second and third weeks of the four-week post-outbreak period, peaking at 4557 dispatches/day. After the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, there were significant increases in chief complaints of fever (211% increase, p<0.001) and respiratory symptoms (245% increase, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The number of EMS calls and dispatches in Tehran increased 347% and 20%, respectively, after the outbreak of COVID-19. Despite this, the time on hold for EMS response decreased.

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) provides a gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but tests are expensive and supply chains are potentially fragile, motivating interest in additional assay methods. Reverse Transcription and Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) provides an alternative that uses orthogonal and often less expensive reagents without the need for thermocyclers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is typically detected using dyes to report bulk amplification of DNA; however a common artifact is nonspecific DNA amplification, which complicates detection. Results: Here we describe the design and testing of molecular beacons, which allow sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with improved discrimination in simple reaction mixtures. To optimize beacons for RT-LAMP, multiple locked nucleic acid monomers were incorporated to elevate melting temperatures. We also show how beacons with different fluorescent labels can allow convenient multiplex detection of several amplicons in 'single pot' reactions, including incorporation of a human RNA LAMP-BEAC assay to confirm sample integrity. Comparison of LAMP-BEAC and RT-qPCR on clinical saliva samples showed good concordance between assays. We also describe custom polymerases for LAMP-BEAC and inexpensive purification procedures.

The improvement of turnaround time and number of pathogens included in the panels, as well as the growing body of epidemiological and clinical data, should help rationalize the use of these tests, facilitate the interpretation of their results and guide the use of antiviral treatments in development.","output":"Place des virus respiratoires dans les pneumonies aigu?s communautaires de l'adulte : quels changements depuis la Covid-19 ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 spread across the globe Every country has attempted to reduce the spread by containment policy Indonesia as one of the hot spot countries in So","output":"Do Human Restriction Mobility Policy in Indonesia Effectively Reduce the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of recent discoveries harnessing the adaptive immune system of prokaryotes to perform targeted genome editing is having a transformative influence across the biological sciences. The discovery of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins has expanded the applications of genetic research in thousands of laboratories across the globe and is redefining our approach to gene therapy. Traditional gene therapy has raised some concerns, as its reliance on viral vector delivery of therapeutic transgenes can cause both insertional oncogenesis and immunogenic toxicity. While viral vectors remain a key delivery vehicle, CRISPR technology provides a relatively simple and efficient alternative for site-specific gene editing, obliviating some concerns raised by traditional gene therapy. Although it has apparent advantages, CRISPR/Cas9 brings its own set of limitations which must be addressed for safe and efficient clinical translation. This review focuses on the evolution of gene therapy and the role of CRISPR in shifting the gene therapy paradigm.

But the mechanism for such protection is not clear. Here, we report that in damaged proximal tubules of high-fat diet-fed ApoE-knockout mice, a model of non-proteinuric DKD, ATP production shifted from lipolysis to ketolysis dependent due to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We further found that empagliflozin raised endogenous ketone body (KB) levels, and thus its use or treatment with 1,3-butanediol, a KB precursor, prevented decreases in renal ATP levels and organ damage in the mice. The renoprotective effect of empagliflozin was abolished by gene deletion of Hmgcs2, a rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis. Furthermore, KBs attenuated mTORC1-associated podocyte damage and proteinuria in diabetic db/db mice. Our findings show that SGLT2 inhibition-associated renoprotection is mediated by an elevation of KBs that in turn corrects mTORC1 hyperactivation that occurs in non-proteinuric and proteinuric DKD.","output":"SGLT2 Inhibition Mediates Protection from Diabetic Kidney Disease by Promoting Ketone Body-Induced mTORC1 Inhibition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To ensure the sustainable development of mountain livestock farming, the adequate remuneration of high-quality dairy products is fundamental.

Patients admitted to a pediatric hospital with worsening respiratory symptoms were tested using a multiplex PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swabs. The additive seasonal effects of outdoor temperatures and indoor relative humidity (RH) were evaluated. The 8-year average peak activity of human coronaviruses occurred in the first week of January, when droplet and contact transmission was enabled by the low indoor RH of 20-30%. Previous studies have shown that an increase in RH to 50% has been associated with markedly reduced viability and transmission of influenza virus and animal coronaviruses. As disease incidence was reduced by 50% in early March, to 75% in early April, to greater than 99% at the end of April, a relationship was observed from colder temperatures in January with a low indoor RH to a gradual increase in outdoor temperatures in April with an indoor RH of 45-50%. As a lipid-bound, enveloped virus with similar size characteristics to endemic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 should be subject to the same dynamics of reduced viability and transmission with increased humidity. In addition to the major role of social distancing, the transition from lower to higher indoor RH with increasing outdoor temperatures could have an additive effect on the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 cases in May. Over the 8-year period of this study, human coronavirus activity was either zero or >99% reduction in the months of June through September, and the implication would be that SARS-Cov-2 may follow a similar pattern.","output":"The Seasonal End of Human Coronavirus Hospital Admissions with Implications for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Pandemics are known to affect mental health of the general population and various at-risk groups like healthcare workers, students and people with chronic medical diseases. However, not much is known of the mental health of people with pre-existing mental illness during a pandemic. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates, whether people with pre-existing mental illness experience an increase in mental health symptoms and experience more hospitalizations during a pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the EMBASE, OVID-MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases to identify potentially eligible studies. Data were extracted independently and continuous data were used in calculating pooled effect sizes of standardized mean difference (SMD) using the random-effects model. RESULTS: Of 1791 records reviewed 15 studies were included. People with pre-existing mental illness have significantly higher psychiatric symptoms, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms compared to controls during a pandemic with pooled effect sizes (SMD) of 0.593 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.72), 0.616 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.73) and 0.597 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.80) respectively. Studies also found a reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations and utilization of psychiatric services during pandemics. CONCLUSION: The review highlights the need for mental health services to address the increased mental health symptoms in people with pre-existing mental illnesses during a pandemic.

This large-scale project used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45% of variance at baseline, and up to 18% of variance at the end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21% and 12%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner's ratings on those variables). Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person's own relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report variables.

Enhancing urban vitality through the rational design of urban forms is a leading topic of Western urban research. An urban growth pattern (UGP) reflects the dual characteristics of a static pattern and the dynamic evolution of the external urban form. It affects urban vitality by influencing the spatial allocation of internal structural elements and patterns in the adjacent location. The cellular automata (CA) mode can effectively simulate the aggregation process of urban growth (infilling expansion or edge expansion). However, it does not simulate the diffusion of urban growth, specifically the evolution of outlying expansion. In addition, CA focuses on learning, simulating, and building knowledge about geographic processes, but does not spatially optimize collaborative land use against multiple objectives or model multi-scale land use. As such, this paper applies a coupling model called the promoting urban vitality model, based on cellular automata (CA) and genetic algorithm (GA) (abbreviated as UV-CAGA). UV-CAGA optimally allocates cells with different UGPs, creating a city form that promotes urban vitality. Wuhan, the largest city in Central China, was selected as a case study to simulate and optimize its urban morphology for 2025. The main findings were as follows. (1) The urban vitality of the optimized urban form scheme was 4.8% higher than the simulated natural expansion scheme. (2) Compared to 2015, after optimization, the simulated sizes of the newly increased outlying, edge, and infilling areas in 2025 were 6.51 km(2), 102.69 km(2), and 23.48 km(2), respectively; these increases accounted for 4.90%, 77.32%, and 17.68%, respectively, of the newly increased construction land area. This indicated that Wuhan is expected to have a very compact urban form. (3) The infilling expansion type resulted in the highest average urban vitality level (0.215); the edge expansion type had the second highest level (0.206); outlying growth achieved the lowest vitality level (0.199). The UV-CAGA model proposed in this paper improves on existing geographical process simulation and spatial optimization models. The study successfully couples the bottom-up CA model and top-down genetic algorithm to generate dynamic urban form optimization simulations. This significantly improves upon traditional CA models, which do not simulate the diffusion process. At the same time, the spatial optimization framework of the genetic algorithm in the model also provides insights related to other effects related to urban form optimization, such as urban environmental security, commuting, and air pollution.

This study was conducted to assess the CT features in confirmed cases with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, initial chest CT data of 363 confirmed cases with COVID-19 were reviewed. All subjects were stratified into three groups based on patients' clinical outcomes; non-critical group (n=194), critical group (n=65), and death group (n=104). The detailed of CT findings were collected from patients' medical records and then evaluated for each group. In addition, multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors according to CT findings in three groups of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with the non-critical group, mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation lesion, pleural effusion lesion, presence of diffuse opacity in cases, more than 2 lobes involved and opacity scores were significantly higher in the critical and death groups (P<0.05). Having more mixed GGO with consolidation, pleural effusion, lack of pure GGO, more diffuse opacity, involvement of more than 2 lobes and high opacity score identified as independent risk factors of critical and death groups.

A six-session, parent-led, transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral teletherapy program was adapted from an established protocol to help youth aged between 5 and 13 years manage emotional problems during the pandemic. METHODS: One-hundred twenty-nine parents of youth struggling with emotional problems during the COVID-19 pandemic participated in the program. Parents reported on their children's psychosocial functioning before and after treatment using validated assessments. They also reported on treatment satisfaction. Clinician-rated global improvement was assessed at each session to determine clinically significant treatment response. RESULTS: Significant improvements in parent proxy-reported anxiety (d = 0.56), depression (d = 0.69), stress (d = 0.61), anger (d = 0.69), family relationships (d = 0.32), and COVID-19-related distress (d = 1.08) were found, with 62% of participants who completed the program being classified as treatment responders. Parents reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by use of primarily parent-report assessments and a lack of a control group. CONCLUSIONS: Brief, parent-led, transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral teletherapy appeared to be an effective way to help youth cope with the pandemic and may be a scalable framework in response to large-scale mental health crises.","output":"Brief, parent-led, transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral teletherapy for youth with emotional problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We established an international consortium to review and discuss relevant clinical evidence in order to develop expert consensus statements related to cancer management during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

RECENT FINDINGS: Bacterial and non-bacterial ARS have similar symptoms, although they can be discriminated by using a combination of specific signs and symptoms. The prescription of antibiotics should be limited to clearly suspected bacterial ARS. There is an overuse of diagnosis tools and treatment prescriptions. The total cost per ARS episode in Europe is over 1000. SUMMARY: ARS is mainly an inflammatory disease triggered by viral infection, and few cases end up developing bacterial infection. In most of the cases, it is a self-resolving disease which diagnosis is mainly clinical and the treatment symptomatic. The incidence of complications is low and independent of antibiotic use. There is a high socioeconomic burden associated to ARS.","output":"Common Cold and Acute Rhinosinusitis: Up-to-Date Management in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing evidence that the risk and burden of COVID-19 infections are not equally distributed across population subgroups and that racialized communities are experiencing disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality rates. However, due to the absence of large-scale race-based data, it is impossible to measure the extent to which immigrant and racialized communities are experiencing the pandemic and the impact of measures taken (or not) to mitigate these impacts, especially at a local level. To address this issue, the Ottawa Local Immigration Partnership partnered with the Collaborative Critical Research for Equity and Transformation in Health lab at the University of Ottawa and the Canadians of African Descent Health Organization to implement a project to build local organizational capacities to understand, monitor, and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant and racialized populations. This research note describes the working framework used for this project, proposed indicators for measuring the determinants of health among immigrant and racialized populations, and the data gaps we encountered. Recommendations are made to policymakers, and community and health stakeholders at all levels on how to collect and use data to address COVID-19 health inequities, including data collection strategies aimed at community engagement in the collection of disaggregated data, improving methods for collecting and analyzing data on immigrants and racialized groups and policies to enable and enhance data disaggregation.

The challenges of such transition included the need for enhanced infrastructure facilities, compliance to directives from regulatory bodies, providing an equivalent learning experience in the virtual learning environment (VLE) and ensuring the end user capacity to utilise the VLE created. Methods: To accomplish this task a suitable instructional design and transition model was utilised to create an integrated Moodle and Microsoft Teams platform as the VLE. The curriculum was recreated in the VLE through review of existing infrastructure and resources, deconstructing the demands of the curriculum, reconstructing the learning experiences of curriculum in VLE and innovating to improve. The end user training was also provided using the same VLE created, which ensured capacity building. Virtual Clinical Assessments (VCA) were created to ensure the completion of assessment tasks. Results: The utilisation of the ACTIONS transition model resulted in the evolution of instructional delivery from a Web Enhanced approach to a customised Web Centric approach and implementation of Virtual Clinical Assessments. Students expressed their satisfaction in the learning experience through VLE, but were anxious about their clinical training and connectivity issues. Conclusion: This transition demonstrated the need of future directions in terms of learner readiness to be more self-directed and self-determined, design thinking for transformation to a Web Centric curriculum, faculty readiness to change and develop the competency of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK).

This brought into stark relief the fact that urban economic activity is no longer attached to specific workplaces. This detachment has been analysed in research on organisations and workers, but has not yet been incorporated into concepts used to document and plan the economic geography of cities. In this article, three questions are explored by way of an original survey: first, how can a shift in the location of economic activity be measured at the urban scale whilst incorporating the idea that work is not attached to a single location? Second, what is the nature of the shift that occurred in March 2020? Third, what does this tell us about concepts that have underpinned the study of urban economic form by geographers and planners? Applying concepts developed in organisation studies and sociology, we operationalise the idea that economic activity happens across multiple spaces: it occurs within a probability space, and since March 2020 it has shifted within this space. To better understand and interpret the longer-term impact of this shift on cities ? downtowns in particular ? we draw upon interviews with people working from home.","output":"Towards a post-COVID geography of economic activity: Using probability spaces to decipher Montreals changing workscapes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 17, 2020, a member of a Skagit County, Washington, choir informed Skagit County Public Health (SCPH) that several members of the 122-member choir had become ill. Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms. SCPH obtained the choir's member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among confirmed cases and 86.7% among all cases). Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7%), and two died (3.7%). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice. The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5). These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.","output":"High SARS-CoV-2 Attack Rate Following Exposure at a Choir Practice - Skagit County, Washington, March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Smell and taste loss are characteristic symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates. RESULTS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Risk Factors for Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunctions in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implementing cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), the first-line psychological treatment for panic disorder (PD), may be challenging in patients with comorbid coronary artery disease (CAD).This study aimed at assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a CBT for PD protocol that was adapted to patients suffering from comorbid CAD. It also aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the intervention to reduce PD symptomatology and psychological distress and improve quality of life. This was a single-case experimental design with pre-treatment, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up measures. Patients with PD and stable CAD received 14 to 17 individual, 1-h sessions of an adapted CBT for PD protocol. They completed interviews and questionnaires at pre-treatment, post-treatment and at a 6-month follow-up assessing intervention acceptability, PD symptomatology, psychological distress and quality of life. A total of 6 patients out of 7 completed the intervention and 6-month follow-up, indicating satisfactory feasibility. Acceptability was high (medians of  8.5 out of 9 and  80%) both at pre and post treatment. Remission rate was of 83% at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. The intervention appeared to have positive effects on comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms and quality of life. The intervention appeared feasible and acceptable in patients with comorbid CAD. The effects of the adapted CBT protocol on PD symptoms, psychological distress and quality of life are promising and were maintained at the 6-month follow-up.

In the present study, composite structures of lysozyme amyloid fibrils with zein proteins were fabricated using the antisolvent precipitation method by applying different blending and pH adjustment sequences. Globular prolamins were bound to the amyloid fibrils to combine their respective advantages. The dynamic light scattering showed that the composites with a characteristic stabilized behavior (43.60  1.75 mV ~ 35.20  0.65 mV) were formed at pH 4.0-5.0, in which non-covalent interactions between fibril and particles occurred. Two different structures, fruit tree-like structure and beaded-like structure, were presented in AFM and TEM images due to the different pH adjustment sequences, while blending sequences had negligible effect on the morphology of the composites. A fruit tree-like entity was detected for lysozyme fibrils-zein composites, where its \\"branches\\" bear zein globular particles. A beaded-like structure was observed for lysozyme fibrils-zein composites, where lysozyme fibril was the thread and zein aggregates were the beads. The potential mechanism of this phenomenon can be explained as the fruit tree-like structure being primarily formed through electrostatic interactions while the beaded-like structure is mainly caused by hydrophobic interactions. The composites of fruit tree-like structures hold a more promising stability than those with beaded-like structures. The results of this research would give constructive information for the fabrication of amyloid fibril-prolamin protein composites, which may exhibit the combined advantages of each components and have potential applications in encapsulation and protection of bioactive substances and stabilizing emulsions.","output":"Fabrication of Composite Structures of Lysozyme Fibril-Zein using Antisolvent Precipitation: Effects of Blending and pH Adjustment Sequences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of non-invasive respiratory strategies (NIRS) is crucial to improve oxygenation in COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia refractory to conventional oxygen therapy. However, the absence of respiratory symptoms may delay the start of NIRS. The aim of this study was to determine whether a simple bedside test such as single-breath counting test (SBCT) can predict the need for NIRS in the 24 h following the access to Emergency Department (ED). We performed a prospective observational study on 120 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. ROC curves were used to analyze factors which might predict NIRS requirement. We found that 36% of patients had normal respiratory rate and did not experience dyspnea at rest. 65% of study population required NIRS in the 24 h following the access to ED. NIRS-requiring group presented lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) (235.09 vs. 299.02), SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (357.83 vs. 431.07), PaCO(2) (35.12 vs. 40.08), and SBCT (24.46 vs. 30.36) and showed higher incidence of dyspnea at rest (57.7% vs. 28.6%). Furthermore, SBCT predicted NIRS requirement even in the subgroup of patients without respiratory symptoms (AUC = 0.882, cut-off = 30). SBCT might be a valuable tool for bedside assessment of respiratory function in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and might be considered as an early clinical sign of impending respiratory deterioration.","output":"Single-Breath Counting Test Predicts Non-Invasive Respiratory Support Requirements in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread psychological effects of contagion mitigation measures associated with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are well known. Phases of lockdown have increased levels of anxiety and depression globally.

Emergency medical data from ambulance services may be a better reflection of male mental health. We use ambulance data to identify unusual clusters of high rates of male mental health emergencies occurring in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom during the first national lockdown and to explore factors that may explain clusters. Analysis of more than 5,000 cases of male mental health emergencies revealed 19 unusual spatial clusters. Binary logistic regression analysis ((2) = 787.22, df = 20, p  .001) identified 16 factors that explained clusters, including proximity to healthy features of the physical landscape, urban and rural dynamics, and socioeconomic condition. Our findings suggest that the factors underlying vulnerability of males to severe mental health conditions during lockdown vary within and between rural and urban spaces, and that the wider hinterland surrounding clusters influences the social and physical access of males to services that facilitate mental health support. Limitations on social engagement to mitigate effects of the pandemic are likely to continue. Our approach could inform delivery of emergency services and the development of community-level services to support vulnerable males during periods of social isolation.","output":"Characterizing Unusual Spatial Clusters of Male Mental Health Emergencies Occurring During the First National COVID-19 Lockdown in the East Midlands Region, UK: A Geospatial Analysis of Ambulance 999 Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Time series forecasting is a growing domain with diverse applications. However, changes of the system behavior over time due to internal or external influences are challenging. Therefore, predictions of a previously learned fore-casting model might not be useful anymore. In this paper, we present EVent-triggered Augmented Refitting of Gaussian Process Regression for Seasonal Data (EVARS-GPR), a novel online algorithm that is able to handle sudden shifts in the target variable scale of seasonal data. For this purpose, EVARS-GPR com-bines online change point detection with a refitting of the prediction model using data augmentation for samples prior to a change point. Our experiments on sim-ulated data show that EVARS-GPR is applicable for a wide range of output scale changes. EVARS-GPR has on average a 20.8 % lower RMSE on different real-world datasets compared to methods with a similar computational resource con-sumption. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm leads to a six-fold reduction of the averaged runtime in relation to all comparison partners with a periodical refitting strategy. In summary, we present a computationally efficient online fore-casting algorithm for seasonal time series with changes of the target variable scale and demonstrate its functionality on simulated as well as real-world data.

The aim of this study was to quantify how much of the disproportionate disease burden can be attributed to ethnicity and deprivation as well as its interaction. An ecological study was conducted using data derived from the Office for National Statistics data at a Local Authority District (LAD) level in England between 1st March and 17th April 2020. The primary analysis examined how age adjusted COVID-19 mortality depends on ethnicity, deprivation, and the interaction between the two using linear regression. The secondary analysis using spatial regression methods allowed for the quantification of the extent of LAD spillover effect of COVID-19 mortality. We find that in LADs with the highest deprivation quartile, where there is a 1 percentage point increase in \\"Black-African (regression coefficient 2.86; 95% CI 1.08-4.64)\\", \\"Black-Caribbean (9.66: 95% CI 5.25-14.06)\\" and \\"Bangladeshi (1.95: 95% CI 1.14-2.76)\\" communities, there is a significantly higher age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality compared to respective control populations. In addition, the spatial regression results indicated positive significant correlation between the age-adjusted mortality in one LAD and the age-adjusted mortality in a neighbouring LAD, suggesting a spillover effect.

However, it has been hindered by limited access to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and testing infrastructure. In regions with limited testing capacity, routinely collected health data might be leveraged to identify geographical locales experiencing higher than expected rates of COVID-19-associated symptoms for more specific testing activities. METHODS: We developed syndromic surveillance tools to analyse aggregated health facility data on COVID-19-related indicators in seven low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Liberia. We used time series models to estimate the expected monthly counts and 95% prediction intervals based on 4 years of previous data. Here, we detail and provide resources for our data preparation procedures, modelling approach and data visualisation tools with application to Liberia. RESULTS: To demonstrate the utility of these methods, we present syndromic surveillance results for acute respiratory infections (ARI) at health facilities in Liberia during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (January through August 2020). For each month, we estimated the deviation between the expected and observed number of ARI cases for 325 health facilities and 15 counties to identify potential areas of SARS-CoV-2 circulation. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic surveillance can be used to monitor health facility catchment areas for spikes in specific symptoms which may indicate SARS-CoV-2 circulation. The developed methods coupled with the existing infrastructure for routine health data systems can be leveraged to monitor a variety of indicators and other infectious diseases with epidemic potential.","output":"Syndromic surveillance using monthly aggregate health systems information data: methods with application to COVID-19 in Liberia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has meant significant precautions and changes in delivering healthcare services. The aim of the study was to explore the lifestyle changes of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania, the changes in prenatal care and delivery during the pandemic and the psychological impact on women and to determine how healthcare providers can help them to overcome this period. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted anonymously and distributed among pregnancy-related groups from Romania, recruiting 559 study participants, between May and October 2020. A total of 559 pregnant women completed an online 26-item questionnaire but we only validated 557 responses for study. The survey included basic demographic questions, pregnancy-related questions, questions regarding the pregnant womens lifestyle changes during the pandemic and their perception of the COVID-19 pandemic and questions which evaluated the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and delivery in Romania. Results: The pandemic restrictions affected womens routine activities regarding professional, familial and social life. Therefore, for pregnant women who were emotionally vulnerable, these restrictions had a great impact on their mental health. The majority of the study participants (78.8%, N = 439) were emotionally affected by the pandemic. The fear related to the possibility of having their pregnancy affected by the virus was dominant in the group (45.8%). A high number of women (69.5%) felt safe when they accessed health services, but private hospitals were considered safer (53.1%) compared to public hospitals (14.4%). The majority of participants (53.7%) used to have prenatal care in a private healthcare system. During the pandemic, preventive measures were associated with low confidence in the healthcare system. Of the total group of participants, 123 women (22.1%) gave birth during the pandemic. Of these, a majority of the study participants considered that it was very difficult for them to cope without their partner during the hospitalization and labor period. Conclusions: The main anxiety of pregnant women were related to threats to their lives and their babys health because of the uncertainty caused by pandemic. It is important to know that the restrictions and the changes in maternity care had a negative impact on them. This conclusion must be taken into account when preventive measures will be decided for helping them to get through such a period. Additionally, psychological support will be essential for improving the mental health of pregnant women and for preventing a negative outcome of the pregnancy. These feelings must be taken into account when preventive measures will be established during pandemic and a psychological support will be essential for improving their mental health for preventing negative outcome of pregnancy.","output":"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pregnant Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a serious global health problem. In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture or moxibustion is used to directly stimulate select acupoints on the surface of the human body and produce physical stimulation to further stimulate regulatory functions in the body, strengthening bodily resistance, eliminating disease, and adjusting the viscera. However, this Chinese medicine knowledge does not include the specific mechanisms of action or targets of acupoints. Therefore, an in-depth research is needed. METHODS: An acupoint-element database was constructed, and the target elements of the Feishu point were screened. The UniProt-Swiss-Prot sublibrary was used to obtain correct gene name information. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and GEO2R were used to analyze differentially expressed genes in pneumonia. The STRING database was used to analyze interactions, construct a network of the Feishu point efficacy system in pneumonia, and elucidate the mechanisms of action. RESULTS: The Feishu point comprises 34 elements in total. The protein interaction analysis has 38 nodes and 115 edges. The Feishu point efficacy system-pneumonia system network shows that cytokine signaling in the immune system, signaling by interleukins (ILs), IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, and the immune system may be related to immunity and inflammation. The Feishu point efficacy system regulating pneumonia showed that FCER2, IL4R, FASLG, TGFB1, IL6R, STAT6, IL1B, CASP3, IL5RA, IL2RB, MYD88, SQSTM1, IL12RB1, IFNGR1, ADAM17, and CDH1 are the main targets. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of systematic acupuncture and moxibustion, the Feishu point regulates cytokine signaling in the immune system, signaling by ILs, IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, and the immune system by targeting FCER2, IL4R, FASLG, TGFB1, IL6R, STAT6, IL1B, CASP3, IL5RA, IL2RB, MYD88, SQSTM1, IL12RB1, IFNGR1, ADAM17, and CDH1, thereby regulating pneumonia.","output":"Examining the Effector Mechanisms of the Feishu Acupoint (BL13) in the Treatment of Pneumonia Based on Systematic Acupuncture and Moxibustion Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in humans in 2002 Despite reports showing Chiroptera as the original animal reservoir of SARS-CoV, many argue that Carnivora-hosted viruses are the most likely origin The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 also involves Chiroptera-hosted lineages However, factors such as the lack of comprehensive phylogenies hamper our understanding of host shifts once MERS-CoV emerged in humans and Artiodactyla Since 2019, the origin of SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), added to this episodic history of zoonotic transmission events Here we introduce a phylogenetic analysis of 2006 unique and complete genomes of different lineages of Orthocoronavirinae We used gene annotations to align orthologous sequences for total evidence analysis under the parsimony optimality criterion Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus were set as outgroups to understand spillovers of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus among ten orders of animals We corroborated that Chiroptera-hosted viruses are the sister group of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-related viruses Other zoonotic events were qualified and quantified to provide a comprehensive picture of the risk of coronavirus emergence among humans Finally, we used a 250 SARS-CoV-2 genomes dataset to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses","output":"Fundamental evolution of all Orthocoronavirinae including three deadly lineages descendent from Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is a limited understanding of the cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 during the post-acute phase, particularly among racially and ethnically diverse patients. METHODS: Approximately four months after COVID-19 diagnosis, patients in the Johns Hopkins Post-Acute COVID-19 Team (JH PACT) Pulmonary Clinic underwent a clinical telephone-based assessment of cognition, depression, anxiety, trauma, and function. RESULTS: The majority of JH PACT patients assessed were women (59%) and members of racial/ethnic minority groups (65%). Of 82 patients, 67% demonstrated 1 abnormally low cognitive score. Patients requiring ICU stays displayed greater breadth and severity of impairment than those requiring less intensive treatment. Processing speed (35%), verbal fluency (26-32%), learning (27%), and memory (27%) were most commonly impaired. Among all patients, 35% had moderate symptoms of depression (23%), anxiety (15%), or functional decline (15%); and 25% of ICU patients reported trauma-related distress. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional decline did not differ by post-ICU versus non-ICU status and were unrelated to global cognitive composite scores. DISCUSSION: At approximately 4 months after acute illness, cognitive dysfunction, emotional distress, and functional decline were common among a diverse clinical sample of COVID-19 survivors varying in acute illness severity. Patients requiring ICU stays demonstrated greater breadth and severity of cognitive impairment than those requiring less intensive treatment. Findings help extend our understanding of the nature, severity, and potential duration of neuropsychiatric morbidity following COVID-19 and point to the need for longitudinal assessment of cognitive and mental health outcomes among COVID-19 survivors of different demographic backgrounds and illness characteristics.","output":"Rates of cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric distress and functional decline following COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Investigate the role of generalized self-efficacy (GSE) in compliance with COVID-19 health behaviours such as wearing masks and social distancing. DESIGN: Two studies conducted online in the US: 312 adults in Study 1 and 253 adults in Study 2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In Study 1, participants reported compliance with four health behaviours related to COVID-19: social distancing, hand washing, avoiding non-essential travel, and wearing masks. In Study 2, participants reported expected compliance with wearing masks when it was framed as a national requirement, a state requirement, or a recommendation. RESULTS: In Study 1, GSE positively affected reported compliance with COVID-19 health behaviours. This result was mediated by the perception that these behaviours would offer enhanced control. Psychological reactance negatively affected reported compliance, while trust in science-based institutions and perceived threat from COVID-19 exerted positive effects. In Study 2, requiring (vs. recommending) masks led to higher willingness to comply with COVID-19 health behaviours. This was moderated by GSE, which significantly impacted compliance only when masks were required rather than recommended. CONCLUSION: Higher GSE predicted increased compliance with health behaviours related to COVID-19, such as wearing masks.

METHODS All patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively enrolled. In a standardized manner, tissue samples were transferred immediately into sterile specimen containers and transported for culture and NGS (MicroGen Dx, Lubbock, TX, USA). Infection definitions using culture and NGS were analyzed for concordance. RESULTS There were 44 total revision arthroplasty cases included. There were no cases of polymicrobial culture results. Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) acnes was the most common bacterial species cultured (8 of 13 [61.5%]) and identified by NGS (12 of 17 [70.1%]) in cases of definite and probable infection. The concordance () between the 2 diagnostic criteria for defining infection that included culture or NGS was 0.333 (fair).

The long-term respiratory, cognitive, mood disorder, and vaping behavior outcomes of patients with EVALI remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term respiratory, cognitive, mood disorder, and vaping behavior outcomes of patients with EVALI. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with EVALI from two health systems. We assessed outcomes at one-year after onset of EVALI using validated instruments measuring: cognitive function, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, respiratory disability, Covid-19 infection, pulmonary function, and vaping behaviors. We used multivariable regression to identify risk factors of post-EVALI vaping behaviors and to identify whether admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was associated with cognitive, respiratory, or mood symptoms. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients completed 12-month follow-up. Most patients were male (66.7%), young (mean age 31  11 years), White (85%), and did not need admission to the ICU (59%). At 12-months, 39% (25 of 64) had cognitive impairment, while 48% (30 of 62) reported respiratory limitations. Mood disorders were common with 59% (38 of 64) reporting anxiety and/or depression and 62% (39 of 63) had post-traumatic stress. 6.4% (4 of 64) reported a history of Covid-19 infection. Despite the history of EVALI, many people continued to vape. Only 38% (24 of 64) reported quitting all vaping and smoking behaviors. Younger age was associated with reduced vaping behavior post-EVALI (OR=0.93, p=0.02). ICU admission was not associated with cognitive impairment, dyspnea, or mood symptoms.

At the end of the program, a 35 item survey questionnaire was shared with the participants. The responses were analysed and are reported here. RESULTS Out of the 797 participants that registered for the course, 356 radiation oncologists responded to the survey questionnaire. Majority (96%) of our respondents believe that there is a need for additional training in target volume delineation. Ninety percent of the participants felt that radiation oncology curriculum requires a formal radiology training but only 6.7% reported that their training consisted of a dedicated rotation and regular lectures in radiological anatomy. Majority (97%) responded that they were likely to incorporate the points learnt from the webinar sessions in their daily practice. Forty eight percent of respondents opted for attending a webinar to an in-person event in the future while 34% would like to have the option to choose between the two.

In the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the gag and pol genes overlap by 241 nucleotides with pol in the -1 phase with respect to gag. The gag-pol fusion is produced via a -1 ribosomal frameshifting event that brings the overlapping, out-of-phase gag and pol genes into translational phase. Frameshifting occurs at a so called 'shift site' 8-10 nucleotides upstream of a hairpin loop which may play a role in the regulation of frameshifting. We have fused this region of HIV-1 to the 5' end of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in order to quantitatively measure ribosomal frameshifting both in cells and by in vitro translation. A series of 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides was designed to specifically bind the sequences which flank the gag-pol hairpin. Ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced up to 6 fold by those oligonucleotides which bind the area just 3 to the stem. Oligonucleotides which bind 5' to the stem have no effect on frameshift efficiency. In addition, we have constructed a series of fusion genes which mimic the effect of the bound oligonucleotides with intramolecular hairpins. The results suggest that increasing RNA secondary structure downstream of the shift site increases the frequency of ribosomal frameshifting, and that this effect can be mimicked by antisense oligonucleotides.","output":"Enhancement of ribosomal frameshifting by oligonucleotides targeted to the HIV gag-pol region."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Antibiotics' rational prescribing is a major goal of the World Health Organization's (WHO) global action-plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance. Evaluation of antibiotic prescribing patterns is necessary to guide simple, globally applicable stewardship interventions. The impact of antimicrobial resistance is devastating, especially in low-income countries. We aimed to introduce ambulatory data on patterns of pediatric antibiotic prescribing in Jordan, which could be used to guide local stewardship interventions. METHODS A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted by selecting a random sample of pediatric patients, who attended ambulatory settings in 2018. Records of outpatients (age 18 years) receiving at least one antibiotic were included. The WHO's model of drug utilization was applied, and all prescribing indicators were included. Multiple linear regression was performed to examine factors influencing the ratio of prescribed antibiotics to overall medications per encounter. RESULTS A total of 20,494 prescriptions, containing 45,241 prescribed drugs, were obtained. Average number of prescribed drugs per prescription was (2.21  0.98). 77.5% of overall ambulatory prescriptions accounted for antimicrobials. Only 0.6% of total prescriptions were for injectables. All antimicrobials (100%) were prescribed by generic-names and from essential drug list. Antibiotics were most commonly prescribed for respiratory tract infections. Age, gender, season, and facility type were significant predictors of prescribed antibiotics to overall medications ratio.

However, very limited work is performed towards the modelling of complex associations between the combined demographic attributes and varying nature of the COVID_19 infections across the globe. Investigating the underlying disease associations with the combined demographical characteristics might help in comprehensive analysis this devastating disease as well as contribute to its effective management.

Social media is a ubiquitous tool to gain and share reliable knowledge and experiences regarding COVID-19.

METHOD: A scoping review inspired by Arksey and OMally was conducted by searches in Medline, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete and Web of Sciences. Empirical research studies investigating nurses use of social media in relation to COVID-19 were included. Exclusion criteria were: Literature reviews, articles in languages other than English, articles about E-health, and articles investigating healthcare professionals without specification of nurses included. Articles, published in January-November 2020, were included and analysed through a thematic analysis. The PRISMA-ScR checklist was used. RESULTS: Most of the eleven included studies were cross-sectional surveys, conducted in developing countries, and had neither social media nor nurses as their main focus of interest. Three themes were identified: Social media as a knowledge node, Social media functioned as profession-promoting channels and Social media as a disciplinary tool. Nurses used social media as channels to gain and share information about COVID-19, and to support each other by highlighting the need for training and changes in delivery of care and redeployment. Further, social media functioned as profession-promoting channels partly sharing heroic self-representations and acknowledgment of frontline persons in the pandemic, partly by displaying critical working conditions. Finally, nurses used social media to educate people to perform the right COVID-19 behaviours in society. CONCLUSION: This review provided snapshots of nurses uses of social media from various regions in the world, but revealed a need for studies from further countries and continents.

Millions of membrane proteins are found in the lipid membrane layer that surrounds cells, and in the lipid membrane layers that surround smaller cellular compartments. Many medicines interact with membrane proteins; these include drugs that treat cancer, heart disease and pain. Research into membrane proteins is therefore important to the design and development of new medicines. Membrane proteins are difficult to work with, partly because they are so small. However, using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, structural biologists, including those at the Membrane Protein Laboratory, are able to see the atomic detail of membrane proteins. There has been great progress in the field of membrane protein structural biology over the past fifteen years. Here, we review the recent advances in membrane protein structural biology, highlight key methods and give an overview of techniques. We also discuss the challenges that remain in this field, and suggest areas for future research. ABSTRACT: Membrane proteins are essential components of many biochemical processes and are important pharmaceutical targets. Membrane protein structural biology provides the molecular rationale for these biochemical process as well as being a highly useful tool for drug discovery. Unfortunately, membrane protein structural biology is a difficult area of study due to low protein yields and high levels of instability especially when membrane proteins are removed from their native environments. Despite this instability, membrane protein structural biology has made great leaps over the last fifteen years. Today, the landscape is almost unrecognisable. The numbers of available atomic resolution structures have increased 10-fold though advances in crystallography and more recently by cryo-electron microscopy. These advances in structural biology were achieved through the efforts of many researchers around the world as well as initiatives such as the Membrane Protein Laboratory (MPL) at Diamond Light Source. The MPL has helped, provided access to and contributed to advances in protein production, sample preparation and data collection. Together, these advances have enabled higher resolution structures, from less material, at a greater rate, from a more diverse range of membrane protein targets. Despite this success, significant challenges remain. Here, we review the progress made and highlight current and future challenges that will be overcome.","output":"Changes in Membrane Protein Structural Biology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In December 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as being responsible for the pulmonary infection called COVID-19. On 21 February 2020, the first autochthonous case of COVID-19 was detected in Italy. Our goal is to report the most common chest computed tomography (CT) findings identified in 64 patients, in the initial phase of COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-four chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) examinations performed at the Radiology Unit of the Hospital of Cremona, from 22 to 29 February 2020, of 64 patients during first week of hospitalization for COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Image analysis was independently conducted by 2 radiologists with 10 years and 1 year of experience in chest imaging. The inter-observer agreement was obtained by applying a Cohens  test. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 67.1 years ( 12.2); men 42 (66%). HRCT was performed on the 5(th) ( 1.5) day of hospitalization. More frequently, the initial CT changes of the lung show more or less extensive areas of ground-glass, as single pattern or with parenchymal consolidations. Coronavirus lung involvement appears very frequently multi-lobar, bilateral, and it concerns both subpleural and central regions. An excellent agreement (: 0.88-1, CI: 0.79-1.01, p < 0.05) concerning CT findings between the 2 operators was reached.

Management strategies often involve maximum safe resection followed by chemoradiotherapy. There has been a move from managing such patients electively rather than the traditional model of treating them as an emergency. While this may have advantages, this can delay the time from presentation to operation. This delay has recently been further compounded by the current COVID-19 pandemic. There is no data available as to whether the surgical delays that are currently occurring have an impact on patient care, and may outweigh the benefits of elective management on health services. We aimed to conduct a single centre observational study to assess how long patients should be waiting prior to surgery. We hypothesised that the longer the wait, the higher the pre-operative complication rate and worse the outcomes. METHOD: 698 patients in a GBM database over a 5-year period (29/10/14- 8/11/19) were studied. All patient data was accessed via electronic patient records Surgical delay was defined as the interval between date of being put on the waiting list (the date seen in the neuro-oncology clinic) to date of surgery. Primary outcome measure was preoperative complications, which was categorised into transient neurological decline, stroke, seizures, diabetes/erratic blood sugars, emergency admission, others (e.g., cardiovascular compromise, steroid complications, blood disorders) Inclusion criteria included: First presentation supratentorial WHO Grade 4 GBM confirmed on histology (this included histological variants such as Gliosarcoma and Epithelioid Glioblastoma), and all patients who had been seen in the neuro-oncology clinic prior to surgery. Exclusion criteria included all patients who were not thought to have a GBM or high-grade glioma on initial imaging, those admitted as an emergency without being seen in a neuro-oncology clinic, recurrent or secondary GBMs. RESULTS: 460 patients met the inclusion criteria in this study. There was a pre-operative complication rate of 14.6% (67/460). 55% of complications were due to a transient neurological decline (37/67) with 16.4 % (11/67) of patients presenting with seizures.

The median length of hospital admission in both groups of patients was 5 days (p= 0.2065) All statistical analysis was carried out using Prism 9 and SPSS CONCLUSION: In spite of unchanged length of hospital stay, we note a significant increase in pre-operative complication rates as a result of surgical delays greater than 7,10 and 14 days, which introduces an interesting debate in the merit of delaying operations for further assessment in clinic. Our objectives would be to minimize complication rate, therefore a high sensitivity i.e. true positive rate would be most desirable. The 99% levels achieved at 7 days In the ROC analysis lends weight to introducing policy to fast-track admissions for primary GBM patients. Further directions could include assessing the impact reduced surgical services and redeployment might have had on complications rates and length of hospital stay on patients admitted over the COVID 19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of surgical delays on pre-operative complications in primary GBM patients- a 5-year study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To compare the functional and anatomic outcomes between eyes in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) who underwent a complete anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) loading dose with aflibercept and those who were switched to dexamethasone intravitreal (DEX) implant after an incomplete anti-VEGF treatment regimen during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective and comparative study conducted on patients with DME. Main outcome measures were mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to month 4. RESULTS: Forty-three eyes (23 eyes in the anti-VEGF group and 20 eyes in the DEX group) were included. Mean BCVA significantly improved from 37.7  25.3 and 35.7  22.0 letters at baseline to 45.4 (23.9) (mean adjusted BCVA improvement 7.6  20.8 letters, p = 0.033) and 46.1  26.0 (mean adjusted BCVA improvement 10.6  15.9 letters, p = 0.049) at month 4 in the anti-VEGF and DEX groups, respectively, with no significant differences between study groups (mean adjusted BCVA difference 2.8 letters, 95% CI ? 9.4 to 14.9 letters, p = 0.648). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of eyes that achieved a BCVA improvement of  5,  10, and  15 letters between groups. CRT was significantly reduced from baseline to month 4 in both DEX (mean adjusted CRT reduction 167.3  148.2 m, p = 0.012) and anti-VEGF groups (mean adjusted CRT reduction 109.9  181.9 m, p < 0.001), with no differences between them (mean adjusted CRT difference 56.1 m, 95% CI ? 46.0 to 158.2 m, p = 0.273). Of 20 eyes in the DEX group, 16 (80.0%) and 9 (45.0%) eyes achieved a CRT reduction of  20% from baseline at 2 months and at 4 months, respectively.

This study aimed to assess the characteristics of kidney injury and its association with disease progression and death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS This is a retrospective study. Two representative cohorts were included. Cohort 1 involved severe and critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 from Wuhan, China. Cohort 2 was all patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Shenzhen city (Guangdong province, China). Any kidney injury was defined as the presence of any of the following: hematuria, proteinuria, in-hospital AKI, or prehospital AKI. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria. The primary outcome was death at the end of follow-up. The secondary outcome was progression to critical illness during the study period. RESULTS A total of 555 patients were enrolled; 42% of the cases (229 of 549) were detected with any kidney injury, 33% of the cases (174 of 520) were detected with proteinuria, 22% of the cases (112 of 520) were detected with hematuria, and 6% of the cases (29 of 520) were detected with AKI. Of the 29 patients with AKI, 21 cases were recognized as in-hospital AKI, and eight were recognized as prehospital AKI. Altogether, 27 (5%) patients died at the end of follow-up. The death rate was 11% (20 of 174) in patients with proteinuria, 16% (18 of 112) in patients with hematuria, and 41% (12 of 29) in the AKI settings. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria (hazard ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 15.94), hematuria (hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 13.81), and in-hospital AKI (hazard ratio, 6.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.42 to 19.31) were associated with death. Among the 520 patients with noncritical illness at admission, proteinuria (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 5.56) and hematuria (hazard ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 5.08) were found to be associated with progression to critical illness during the study period.

Y2H allows identification of protein interaction partners using screening libraries, while RY2H is used to determine residues critical to a given proteinCprotein interaction by exploiting site-directed mutagenesis. Currently, both these techniques still rely on sequencing of positive clones using conventional Sanger sequencing. For Y2H, a screen can yield several positives; the identification of such clones is further complicated by the fact that sequencing products usually contain vector sequence. For RY2H, obtaining a complete sequence is required to identify the full range of residues involved in proteinCprotein interactions. However, with Sanger sequencing limited to 500C800 nucleotides, sequencing is usually carried from both ends for clones greater than this length. Analysis of such RY2H data thus requires assembly of sequencing products combined with trimming of vector sequences and of low-quality bases at the beginning and ends of sequencing products. Further, RY2H analysis requires collation of mutations that abrogate a DB/AD interaction. Here, we present 2HybridTools, a Java program with a user-friendly interface that allows addressing all these issues inherent to both Y2H and RY2H.

During the process of industrial effluent discharge into the water bodies, the toxic substances available in these wastes can affect the aquatic flora and fauna, resultantly disturbing the entire system and constituting human health hazards indirectly or directly. The objective of this study was to estimate the nutritional value of the liver and intestine of fish which is being discarded as waste during fish processing and pollution status by calculated water quality index (WQI) and comparison of both wetlands during diverse seasons. WQI of Harike Wetland was observed to be 56.68 which indicates that water quality in this wetland is poor, while at Nangal Wetland WQI was calculated to be 39.54 and comes under good water quality and safe for the entire ecosystem. HPI (heavy metal pollution index) for Harike Wetland was observed 144.9 and for Nangal Wetland was 3.12, indicating heavy load of heavy metal pollution at test sample site. MI (metal index) value was also detected higher at test sample site (4.76) as compared to that at control site (0.22).

Similarly, mean total saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were also found to decline significantly (p<0.05) in the liver of test fish sample as compared to control fish sample during autumn and winter seasons. Significant (p<0.05) decline of mean total n-3 PUFAs (except winter) and total n-6 PUFAs (except rainy) in the intestine of test fish sample was observed during all the seasons when compared to control fish samples. However, total SFAs were found to increase in the intestine of test fish samples as compared to control fish samples during all the studied seasons.

The engagement of students has been essential for their good academic performance which can be ensured by the active participation of the students and this is a real challenge for the teachers. However, sometimes in online and physical teaching, teachers are also involved in rationalized knowledge hiding, which leads to the disengagement of the students, and this ultimately affects their academic performance. Therefore, the present study aims at measuring the students disengagement in the teaching classes, both physical and online.

The data are obtained through the Questionnaire surveys. The existing study has assessed the role of teachers rationalized knowledge hiding behaviors in the disengagement of students and their lesser grades. It has been found that rationalized knowledge hiding in online teaching does not affect students performance; however, it makes students disengage from their studies in physical classes. Interestingly, the rationalized knowledge hiding in physical teaching has negatively affected the performance of the students. Furthermore, the mediating role of the students disengagement has been found significant in this study. Organizations, especially universities, can ensure maximum knowledge sharing by motivating the instructors through positive reinforcements.

To investigate the overlap in these clinical phenotypes, we compared orthostatic symptoms in daily life and during head-up tilt, heart rate and blood pressure responses to tilt, and reductions in cerebral blood flow in response to orthostatic stress in long-haul COVID-19 patients, ME/CFS controls, and healthy controls. Materials and Methods: We compared 10 consecutive long-haul COVID-19 cases with 20 age- and gender-matched ME/CFS controls with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) during head-up tilt, 20 age- and gender-matched ME/CFS controls with a normal heart rate and blood pressure response to head-up tilt, and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Identical symptom questionnaires and tilt test procedures were used for all groups, including measurement of cerebral blood flow and cardiac index during the orthostatic stress. Results: There were no significant differences in ME/CFS symptom prevalence between the long-haul COVID-19 patients and the ME/CFS patients. All long-haul COVID-19 patients developed POTS during tilt. Cerebral blood flow and cardiac index were more significantly reduced in the three patient groups compared with the healthy controls. Cardiac index reduction was not different between the three patient groups. The cerebral blood flow reduction was larger in the long-haul COVID-19 patients compared with the ME/CFS patients with a normal heart rate and blood pressure response. Conclusions: The symptoms of long-haul COVID-19 are similar to those of ME/CFS patients, as is the response to tilt testing. Cerebral blood flow and cardiac index reductions during tilt were more severely impaired than in many patients with ME/CFS. The finding of early-onset orthostatic intolerance symptoms, and the high pre-illness physical activity level of the long-haul COVID-19 patients, makes it unlikely that POTS in this group is due to deconditioning. These data suggest that similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 infection acts as a trigger for the development of ME/CFS.","output":"Orthostatic Symptoms and Reductions in Cerebral Blood Flow in Long-Haul COVID-19 Patients: Similarities with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Oral Epithelial Dysplasia (OED) is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer development. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is necessitating the suspension or dramatic reduction of face-to-face non-urgent elective services, including OED clinics. Little is known regarding the potential impact of elective services suspension upon the risk of OED progression, and whether alternative strategies (e.g. remote consultations) may be introduced to ensure OED surveillance. The aim of this paper is to provide expert-opinion consensus recommendations for the management of OED during the current and future pandemic outbreaks. Materials and Methods A working group of nine UK-based senior clinicians and academics in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Oral Medicine was created and twelve consensus statements were developed using a modified-Delphi process. Greater than 80% agreement was considered a consensus. Results Consensus was achieved for all twelve statements (89-100% agreement). The group agreed that, during the temporary suspension of elective services associated with COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks, patients with OED can be risk stratified to determine the length of accepted delay in face-to-face consultation. Remote consultations with patient-provided clinical photographs may be a useful way of maintaining a level of surveillance in this group of patients. Conclusions Using an expert working group methodology, we have developed consensus recommendations for the monitoring of individuals with OED during pandemic outbreaks associated with temporary suspension of elective services.

However, the term 'lockdown' is not well-defined. Indeed, WHO's reference to 'so-called lockdown measures' indicates the absence of a clear and universally accepted definition of the term 'lockdown'. We propose a definition of 'lockdown' based on a two-by-two matrix that categorises different communicable disease measures based on whether they are compulsory or voluntary; and whether they are targeted at identifiable individuals or facilities, or whether they are applied indiscriminately to a general population or area. Using this definition, we describe the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. While there were some commonalities in the implementation of lockdown across these countries, a more notable finding was the variation in the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures.

The present study examined the impact of COVID-19 on HSP students early in the pandemic using data from an online survey that was distributed to students from 179 doctoral programs affiliated with the Council of University Directors of Clinical Psychology and distributed by the Council for Chairs of Training Councils to doctoral-level HSP PsyD and PhD programs between May 1st and June 25th, 2020. This study identifies areas of education and training negatively impacted by the pandemic in its first few months, including training and instrumental support, specific training and support in telehealth, safety protections and considerations, and emotional support. Implications of, and recommendations for, addressing the concerns raised by students in these areas are discussed. By implementing these recommendations, training programs can help facilitate HSP students' ability to meet continued training and professional development goals in the later stages of the pandemic.

There is an overlap between the demographics of groups at risk of digital exclusion (older, lower social grade, low educational attainment and ethnic minorities) and those who are vulnerable to poorer health outcomes from SARS-CoV-2. In this national survey study (n = 2040), we assessed how the UK population; particularly these overlapping groups, reported their preparedness for digital health strategies. We report, with respect to using digital information to make health decisions, that those over 60 are less comfortable (net comfort: 57%) than those between 18 and 39 (net comfort: 78%) and lower social grades are less comfortable (net comfort: 63%) than higher social grades (net comfort: 75%). With respect to a preference for digital over non-digital sources in seeking COVID-19 health information, those over 60 (net preference: 21%) are less inclined than those between 18 and 39 (net preference: 60%) and those of low educational attainment (net preference: 30%) are less inclined than those of high educational attainment (net preference: 52%).

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this screening program is unknown. METHODS: The Routine HIV screening program includes opt-out testing of all adults 18 years and older with Glasgow score > 9. HIV 4th generation Ag/Ab screening, with reflex to Gennius confirmatory tests are used. Pre-pandemic (March 2019 to February 2020) to Pandemic period (March 2020 to February 2021) intervals were compared. RESULTS: 72,929 patients visited MHH_ED during the pre-pandemic period and 57,128 in the pandemic period, a 22% decline. The number of patients tested for HIV pre-pandemic was 9433 and 6718 pandemic, a 29% decline. When the pandemic year was parsed into first and last 6 months interval and compared to similar intervals in the year pre pandemic, 39% followed by 16% declines in HIV testing were found. In total, 354 patients were HIV positives, 209, (59%) in the pre-pandemic and 145 (41%) in the pandemic period.The reduction in new HIV infections found was directly proportional to the decline in patients visiting the MHH-ED where the percent of patients HIV positive was constant across intervals (2.21% vs 2.26%). Demographic and outcome characteristics were constant across the compared intervals.

A histological examination of the palatine tonsils of 22 children aged 5 to 14 years old who had a paratonsillar abscess and 18 children suffering from chronic tonsillitis was carried out. Fragments of small salivary glands, located both superficially, in the mucous membrane between the stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium and the lymphoid tissue of the palatine tonsils, and between the muscles of the amygdala were found in 42 of the 80 (52.5%) tonsils studied. Along with the unchanged glandular structure, 26 (61.9%) samples revealed areas of destruction foci in small salivary glands with signs of inflammatory and compensatory regenerative activity. The presence of separate interlobular ducts of the salivary glands with pronounced periductal lymph - macrophage infiltration was noted. The subepithelial lymph-macrophage infiltrates found in the lamina propria are associated with the exit of the excretory ducts of the salivary glands to the surface of the mucous membrane. Many thin-walled veins are surrounded by perivascular lymphocellular infiltrates. The inflammatory and post-inflammatory changes in the small salivary glands revealed by us in children with chronic tonsillitis do not exclude their participation in the pathogenesis of paratonsillitis. At the same time, inflammation in the salivary gland can be both primary, as a result of its infection with live microorganisms from the tissues of the tonsil, and secondary, due to the compression of the excretory ducts by the edematous tissue of the tonsil in acute tonsillitis.","output":"[Small salivary glands in the paratonsillar space in children]./ Malye slyunnye zhelezy v paratonzillyarnom prostranstve u detei"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to compare the trends of hospital admissions due to CVD between the levels 4 and 3 lockdown periods and non-pandemic times and discuss some possible contributing factors to this variation This study focused on hospital admissions related to CVD at Waitemata District Health Board (WDHB) Common presentations of CVD were identified using ICD-10 codes from electronic records The CVD presentations being investigated in this study are ACS, decompensated heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest The study period is the seven-week period comprising of alert level 4 (25 March to 27 April 2020) and level 3 (28 April to 13 May 2020) The controls used were the identical dates in 2018 and 2019 These were chosen as controls to adjust for seasonal impact on various cardiac conditions The unprecedented national lockdown period due to COVID-19 had significant impact on the numbers and pattern of CVD presentations to hospital A decline in ACS admissions have similarly been described in European countries There are several patient-related, healthcare-related and environmental hypotheses which may explain the findings of our study The strict stay-home message, especially for those aged over 70 years, announced by the government and escalating cases of COVID-19 in the early phase of the lockdown likely caused a degree of apprehension for people with cardiac symptoms to seek medical care A total of 15 COVID-19 cases (confirmed plus probable) were admitted to hospital at WDHB during the lockdown period, which could have been a further deterrent for patients presenting to hospital Additionally, staying at home during lockdown would have resulted in a more sedentary lifestyle for the majority of people which may mask exertional angina or dyspnoea due to ACS or heart failure The use of non-contact telephone consultations by general practitioners and specialists during lockdown may have resulted in limitations or delay in diagnosis of patients with CVD The lack of physical examination performed in usual face-to-face consultations have taken away the ability of clinicians to identify subtle signs of heart failure such as pitting oedema or elevated jugular venous pressure","output":"Pandemic control: getting to the heart of unintended consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital patients and personnel are at risk of nosocomial viral infections, as clearly manifested during the COVID-19 pandemic Transmission of respiratory viral pathogens can occur through contaminated surfaces, including from medical textiles Copper has potent biocidal properties, and cuprous oxide impregnated medical textiles (CMT) reduce hospital-acquired bacterial infections In the current study we confirm the antimicrobial properties of CMT and determine their capacity to reduce infectious titres of human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in an independent laboratory The antibacterial and antiviral activities of the CMT were determined according to AATCC TM100-2019 and ISO 18184:2019 standards, respectively The CMT reduced by 4 logs the viable titers of MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida auris after 2 h of incubation Viable titers of Clostridium difficile were reduced by 2 3, 3, and 4 logs after 2, 6, and 18 h, respectively Infectious titers of HCoV-229E exposed to CMT for 2 h were reduced by 2 8 and 4 logs (99 85% and 99 99% reductions) as compared to Time-0 control and initial inoculum, respectively The CMT retain their antibacterial efficacy even after 100 industrial washings Use of cuprous oxide impregnated textiles in clinical settings may reduce not only hospital acquired infections caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens, but also, and equally important, those caused by coronavirus and other viruses","output":"Drastic Reduction of Bacterial, Fungal and Viral Pathogen Titers by Cuprous Oxide Impregnated Medical Textiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed at identifying human neural proteins that can be attacked by cross-reacting SARS-COV-2 antibodies causing Guillain-Barr syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the anticipated effect of COVID-19 on violent discipline at home using multivariable predictive regression models. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 1-14 years and household members from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) conducted in Nigeria, Mongolia, and Suriname before the COVID-19 pandemic were included. METHODS: A conceptual model of how the COVID-19 pandemic could affect risk factors for violent discipline was developed. Country specific multivariable linear models were used to estimate the association between selected variables from MICS and a violent discipline score which captured the average combination of violent disciplinary methods used in the home. A review of the literature informed the development of quantitative assumptions about how COVID-19 would impact the selected variables under a \\"high restrictions\\" pandemic scenario, approximating conditions expected during a period of intense response measures, and a \\"lower restrictions\\" scenario with easing of COVID-19 restrictions but with sustained economic impacts. These assumptions were used to estimate changes in violent discipline scores. RESULTS: Under a \\"high restrictions\\" scenario there would be a 35%-46% increase in violent discipline scores in Nigeria, Mongolia and Suriname, and under a \\"lower restrictions\\" scenario there would be between a 4%-6% increase in violent discipline scores in these countries.

Self-administered questionnaires included demographic data, smartphone addiction, media multitasking motivation, interpersonal competency, and phubbing. RESULTS: Phubbing was positively correlated with smartphone addiction (r=0.41, p<0.001) and media multitasking motivation (r=0.16, p<0.05), and negatively correlated with interpersonal competence (r=-0.51, p<0.001).

Number of positive cases and number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater were significantly correlated (p = 0.013).

During the summer period, the superposition of curves was less evident as subject to many confounding factors that were discussed. We also tried to correlate the effect of viral circulation in wastewater with containment measures, probably the most unbiased correlation on their potential inflection effect of epidemic curves. Not only is this correlation not obvious, but it also clearly appears that the drop in cases as well as the drop in the viral load in the sewers occur before the containment measures. In fact, this suggests that there are factors that initiate the end of the epidemic peak independently of the containment measure.

METHODS: A 'cough-generator' was fixed to a theatre trolley at 45. Fluorescein-stained 'secretions' were projected on to a series of calibrated targets. These were photographed under UV light and 'source detection' software measured droplet splatter size and distance. FINDINGS: The smallest droplet detected was a120 m and the largest a24,000 m. An average of 25,862 spots was detected in the non-laminar theatre, compared with 11,430 in the laminar theatre (56% reduction). The laminar air flow mainly affected the smaller droplets (<1000 m). The surface area covered with droplets was: 6% at 50 cm, 1% at 2 m, and 0.5% at 3 m in the non-laminar air flow; and 3%, 0.5%, and 0.2% in the laminar air flow, respectively.

The laminar air flow affected the smaller droplets but had limited effect on larger droplets in our 'aerosol-generating procedure' cough model. Our results indicate that the laminar air flow theatre requires similar post-surgery cleaning to the non-laminar, and staff should consider full personal protective equipment for medium- and high-risk patients.","output":"Comparison of droplet spread in standard and laminar flow operating theatres: SPRAY study group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Alcohol use and abuse constitute a major public health problem and identifying their determinants is a priority. Social network analysis can indicate how characteristics of social networks are related to individual health behaviors. A growing number of studies have used social network analysis to examine how social network characteristics influence adult alcohol consumption, but this literature has never been systematically reviewed and summarized. The current paper systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network analysis to assess the influence of social network characteristics on drinking behaviors in adults. METHODS A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and a review of the reference lists of retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers independently screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further screened the full text of 150 articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were judged eligible and included. RESULTS Most studies were conducted among young adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up visits with adolescent networks moving into adulthood. The objectives and methods of the included studies were heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically significant association between a social network characteristic and an alcohol consumption-related outcome. Social network members drinking behaviors were associated with participants' drinking behaviors in multiple ways. DISCUSSION In young adults, among whom the majority of identified studies were conducted, with whom they socialize and how they socialize appears to be associated with alcohol consumption; this was observed across methodologies and settings. We still know very little about the relationship of social networks to drinking in older age groups, and in populations most impacted by alcohol. As social networks appear to play a role in the consumption of alcohol in young adulthood, interventions that utilize social networks to help reduce harmful alcohol consumption should be considered.","output":"Using social network analysis to examine alcohol use among adults: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artist Francisca Lita Sez considers experience of physicians during Spain's COVID-19 pandemic.

The porcine intestinal epithelium is the target of TGEV infection, but the mechanisms that TGEV disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and invades the host epithelium remain largely unknown. We not only found that TGEV infection stimulates F-actin to gather at the cell membrane but the disruption of F-actin inhibits TGEV entry as well. Cofilin is involved in F-actin reorganization and TGEV entry. The TGEV spike protein is capable of binding with EGFR, activating the downstream phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), then causing the phosphorylation of cofilin and F-actin polymerization via Rac1/Cdc42 GTPases. Inhibition of EGFR and PI3K decreases the entry of TGEV. EGFR is also the upstream activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways that is involved in F-actin reorganization. Additionally, lipid rafts act as signal platforms for the EGFR-associated signaling cascade and correlate with the adhesion of TGEV. In conlusion, these results provide valuable data of the mechanisms which are responsible for the TGEV pathogenesis and may lead to the development of new methods about controlling TGEV.","output":"The epidermal growth factor receptor regulates cofilin activity and promotes transmissible gastroenteritis virus entry into intestinal epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers the problem of enabling the user to modify the path of a telepresence robot. The robot is capable of autonomously navigating to the goal indicated by the user, but the user might still want to modify the path without changing the goal, for example, to go further away from other people, or to go closer to landmarks she wants to see on the way. We propose Human-Influenced Dynamic Window Approach (HI-DWA), a shared control method aimed for telepresence robots based on Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) that allows the user to influence the control input given to the robot. To verify the proposed method, we performed a user study (N=32) in Virtual Reality (VR) to compare HI-DWA with switching between autonomous navigation and manual control for controlling a simulated telepresence robot moving in a virtual environment. Results showed that users reached their goal faster using HI-DWA controller and found it easier to use. Preference between the two methods was split equally. Qualitative analysis revealed that a major reason for the participants that preferred switching between two modes was the feeling of control.

The relative contribution of viruses in acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) is, however, poorly documented in Lao PDR. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the etiology of ALRI in patients of all ages in two hospitals of Laos. METHODS: Multiplex PCR/RT\\\\PCR methods were used to target 18 major common respiratory viruses. Between August 2009 and October 2010, samples from 292 patients presenting with ALRI were collected. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Viruses were detected in 162 (55%) samples. In 48% (140/292) of the total ALRI cases, a single virus was detected while coinfections were observed in 8% (22/292) of the samples. The most frequent viruses were rhinovirus/enterovirus (35%), human respiratory syncytial virus (26%), and influenza viruses (13%). Parainfluenza viruses were detected in 9%, adenovirus in 6%, human metapneumovirus in 4%, coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) in 4%, and bocavirus in 3% of ALRI specimens. Most viral infections occurred in patients below 5 years of age. The distribution of viruses varied according to age\\\\groups. No significant correlation was observed between the severity of the disease and the age of patients or the virus species.

It is urgently needed to develop an air filtration membrane that exhibits lasting filtration performance and antibacterial activity. Herein, we report a large-scale blow spinning technique to produce polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber membranes for highly efficient air mechanical filtration and its antibacterial modification by adding the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The PVDF nanofiber membrane with an area density of only 1.0 g/m2 exhibits the highest filtration efficiency of 98.63% for the particle with a size of 0.3 m. After eliminating static electricity, there is almost no reduction in the filtration efficiency of particulate matter with a size larger than 1 m and only 4.69% decrease in the particulate matter with a size of 0.5 m. Hence, the PVDF nanofiber membrane with nanostructures for air filtration works mainly by the means of mechanical filtration. To inhibit the survival or growth of the intercepted bacteria on the membrane, the PVDF/AgNPs nanofiber membrane was fabricated by adding AgNPs to PVDF nanofibers, which exhibits the strongest antibacterial activity of more than 99% and an excellent filtration efficiency similar to that without adding AgNPs. The nanofiber membrane with antibacterial activity is expected to extend the service or storage time or be reused without loss of filtration performance. Additionally, large-scale production of nanofiber filtration membranes has been realized using a multi-needle blow spinning machine. ? 2022 American Chemical Society.","output":"Large-Scale Blow Spinning of Nanofiber Membranes for Highly Efficient Air Mechanical Filtration with Antibacterial Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the challenges teachers and students face in online synchronous learning is not turning on their video cameras. The reasons are multitasking, being concerned about the background, psychological barriers, and poor internet connection. In this study, social presence theory (SPT) was employed as the theoretical lens to understand the possible impacts of video cameras in synchronous online learning. Social presence allows individuals to make personal characteristics visible to the community. Students experience greater levels of trust and rapport because of verbal and nonverbal cues that occur when video cameras are turned on in video conferencing. The use of video cameras in synchronous distant learning creates intimacy and immediacy, leading to teacherClearner social presence, which leads to dialog. The phenomenographic study was carried out to analyze the students perceptions of the phenomena. The eighty-two first-year undergraduate and doctoral students took part in the study. It showed that students perceive a video camera as a tool for cooperation, as well as for self-discipline and self-control. The students relate the use of video cameras with quality studies, the ability to interact, and to be a part of the process. They feel less inclined to participate when their cameras are off. That leads to the weaker studentCteacher relationship, which is achieved with a higher social presence. It is essential to see one other to strengthen students motivation, sense of belonging, and community in the courses for first-year students who are still developing learning habits and social networks.","output":"Should I Turn on My Video Camera?

In a VE with immersive audio technologies implemented, the role of VR simulations must be enacted by a participatory exploration of sense-making in a network of human and non-human agents, called actors. The guardian of such locus of agency is the auditory digital twin that fosters intra-actions between humans and technology, dynamically and fluidly redefining all those configurations that are crucial for an immersive and coherent experience. The idea of entanglement theory is here mainly declined in an egocentric-spatial perspective related to emerging knowledge of the listener's perceptual capabilities.

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anal submucosal Permacol injection in the treatment of FI. METHODS All consecutive patients who underwent Permacol injection for FI over a 3-year period were included. Patients' data relating to obstetric history, anorectal/pelvic operations, type of FI, preoperative anorectal physiology results and follow-up details for outcome measures were collected. Preoperative and postoperative Cleveland Clinic Florida Incontinence Scores (CCFISs) were noted. Patients were surveyed by using a telephone questionnaire to assess the quality of life and other outcome measures. Data were analysed using SPSS ver.19.0. RESULTS Thirty patients (28 females and 2 males) with a median age of 67 years were included in the study. Of those patients, 37%, 50%, and 13% were noted to have passive, mixed and urge FI, respectively. Six of the patients (20%) had repeat Permacol injections, 5 of whom had sustained responses to the first Permacol injection for a mean of 11 months. There was a significant improvement in the CCFIS from a baseline median of 12.5, mean 12.8 interquartile range [IQR], 6-20), to a median of 3.5, mean 4.8 (IQR, 0-20), P < 0.001. Of the patients surveyed by telephone 89% were satisfied with their overall experience and the improvement in their symptoms following Permacol injections. CONCLUSION This study has demonstrated that Permacol injection for the treatment of FI is safe and effective and has no associated major complications.

Lung cancer is the most common cancer, impacting > 2 million patients globally. This observational study utilized a social listening approach to analyze social media trends and gain insights into stakeholder perceptions of lung cancer. METHODS: This social media study retrospectively collated data from open access blogs, forums, and social networking sites. Social media posts were collected between June 2019CMay 2020 from 14 European countries. Using social media aggregator tools, posts comprising lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer-specific terms were extracted. Manual and automated relevancy algorithms filtered the extracted information to provide the relevant dataset. This contextualized dataset was further mined to generate the final data for analysis. RESULTS: Of 1360 conversations analyzed, 42% were generated by patients/caregivers and 14% by healthcare professionals (HCPs). A majority of patients were 51C70 years old (approximately 50%) and 91% (n = 500/550) had late-stage cancer. Treatment (35%) and disease awareness (30%) were among the most discussed topic of the patient journey. Although the overall treatment sentiment was neutral, chemotherapy was the treatment type with the highest associated negative sentiment (28%); fewer negative sentiments were associated with immunotherapy (9%) and targeted therapy (2%), due to perceptions of longer survival outcomes and fewer side effects. In conversations that discussed clinical endpoints, survivability and overall survival (47 and 30%, respectively; n = 539) were most frequently mentioned by stakeholders. HCPs mostly used technical terms, whereas patients and caregivers used colloquial terms such as getting rid of cancer. Emotional wellness was identified to have a huge impact on quality of life in lung cancer. Delay or treatment cancellations due to COVID-19, lack of effective treatments and funding, and lack of empathy by physicians emerged as the key unmet needs among patients/caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Social listening proved to be an effective tool to explore stakeholders perceptions and their key unmet needs, typically not available in published literature or databases, and provides HCPs with valuable insights into the distress, doubts, and needs of lung cancer patients and caregivers.

Recurrence (rCDI) occurs in 30% of cases and increases with subsequent episodes. As part of a trial of fecal microbiota transplantation vs. placebo for the prevention of rCDI, rCDI is identified using a case-finding algorithm that screens for potential cases across all Veterans Affairs facilities, a key component of which is a stool test confirming the presence of C. difficile. With the emergence of Covid-19 in the Unites States in early 2020, study personnel observed a decreasing number of rCDI cases. We hypothesized that Covid restrictions and fear of transmission prevented patients from coming to a VA facility to submit a confirmatory stool sample, the standard method of diagnosing rCDI. Accordingly, the algorithm was modified to also identify cases where rCDI was empirically treated, without confirmatory testing. Here we report on the prevalence of empiric treatment of rCDI during the Covid pandemic and changes in lab-conformed cases over time. Methods Cases of potentially rCDI are identified by a weekly query of VA data, using an algorithm that includes laboratory testing results, diagnostic codes, and prescriptions. The ource database is updated daily from every VA facility, encompassing over 8 million Veterans. Potential cases are reviewed by research coordinators using the medical record to determine study eligibility. Beginning June 2020, the algorithm was adjusted to also identify patients with lab confirmation of their first CDI episode but none for their recurrence and identified those who were prescribed treatment for rCDI. Results We observed a reduction in both the number of weekly cases (22.2 vs. 17.4;P < 0.001) which is a 22% decrease after the Covid-19 emergency declaration (figure).

Contrast enhanced CT and MRI showed an abscess in the umbilical region that was connected to the bladder via a long tube-like structure. It was diagnosed as an infected urachal sinus. Partial excision of the umbilical fossa followed by dissection of the urachal remnant was easily performed using the abdominal wall-lift laparoscopy from the umbilicus down to the bladder without pneumoperitoneum or additional trocar placement. A Pfannenstiel incision was made above the pubis to get access to the junction between the urachal remnant and the bladder. Under direct vision, we succeeded in accurately dividing the remnant tract, and we adequately closed the bladder opening with absorbable sutures. This method has the advantage of easily closing peritoneal defects after excision of the urachal remnant with direct sutures under a laparoscopic view from the umbilicus.

An electronic questionnaire captured data from validated instruments measuring each study variable, as well as participant demographics and perceived impacts of COVID-19 on professional quality of life. RESULTS: Positive, statistically significant correlations were found between mindful self-care, self-compassion, and resilience.

This article reports the development of a novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay - Viroselect - that shows high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. METHODS: A unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a - the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) region - was used to design and develop the assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was utilized to design the primers and probes for the RT-PCR assay. The concordance of this assay with commonly used emergency use authorization (US Food and Drug Administration) manual kits and an automated high-throughput testing platform was evaluated.

For each individual the concentration of particles in expelled air was measured using a six channel laser particle counter and the duration of blowing and velocity of air leaving the vuvuzela were recorded. To allow comparison with other activities undertaken at sports events each individual was also asked to shout and the measurements were repeated while using a paper cone to confine the exhaled air. Triplicate measurements were taken for each individual. The mean peak particle counts were 65810(3) per litre for the vuvuzela and 3.710(3) per litre for shouting, representing a mean log(10) difference of 2.20 (95% CI: 2.03,2.36; p<0.001). The majority (>97%) of particles captured from either the vuvuzela or shouting were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter. Mean peak airflows recorded for the vuvuzela and shouting were 6.1 and 1.8 litres per second respectively. We conclude that plastic blowing horns (vuvuzelas) have the capacity to propel extremely large numbers of aerosols into the atmosphere of a size able to penetrate the lower lung. Some respiratory pathogens are spread via contaminated aerosols emitted by infected persons. Further investigation is required to assess the potential of the vuvuzela to contribute to the transmission of aerosol borne diseases.

This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a 52-day period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population. RESULTS: Of the 1103 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 529 required hospitalization and were included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (52%) were 61C80 years old with a mean body mass index in the obese range. 98% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (79%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (56%) and chronic kidney disease (17%). Patients with chronic kidney disease who received hemodialysis were found to have lower mortality, than those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis Age > 60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (8.3:10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48C96 h. Of the 529 inpatients 48% died, and one third of them died within the first 3 days of admission. 159/529patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 86% died and of the remaining 370 patients, 30% died. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher in-hospital mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.

We named this model EpiBeds. Data from a partially complete patient-pathway line-list was used to provide initial estimates of the mean duration that individuals spend in the different hospital compartments. We then fitted EpiBeds using complete data on hospital occupancy and hospital deaths, enabling estimation of the proportion of individuals that follow different clinical pathways, and the reproduction number of the generalised epidemic.

Choice of mesh and fixation methods are considered crucial issues in preventing recurrences and complications. Lightweight meshes are considered the first choice due to their biomechanical properties and the ability to integrate into the abdominal wall. Titanium helicoidal tacks still represent the \\"gold standard\\" for mesh fixation, even if they have been suggested to be involved in the genesis of post-operative pain and complications. Recently, absorbable tacks have been introduced, under the hypothesis that there will be no need to maintain a permanent fixation device after mesh integration. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that absorbable tacks may guarantee the same results as titanium tacks in terms of strength of fixation and recurrence rates. The primary end point of the present trial is to test the hypothesis that absorbable tacks are non-inferior to titanium tacks in laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair (LIVHR) by lightweight polypropylene mesh, in terms of recurrence rates at 3-year follow-up. Surgical complications, post-operative stay, comfort and pain are secondary end points to be assessed. METHODS/DESIGN Two hundred and twenty patients with ventral hernia will be randomized into 2 groups: Group A (110) patients will be submitted to LIVHR by lightweight polypropylene mesh fixed by titanium tacks; Group B (110) patients will be submitted to LIVHR by lightweight polypropylene mesh fixed by absorbable tacks. DISCUSSION A few retrospective studies have reported similar results when comparing absorbable versus non-absorbable tacks in terms of intraoperative and early post-operative outcomes. These studies have the pitfalls to be retrospective evaluation of small series of patients, and the reported results still need to be validated by larger series and prospective studies. The aim of the present trial is to investigate and test the non-inferiority of absorbable versus non-absorbable tacks in terms of hernia recurrence rates, in order to assess whether the use of absorbable tacks may achieve the same results as non-absorbable tacks in mid-term and long-term settings.

Most notable has been the discovery of asymmetries in homologues of cortical language areas in apes, particularly in the planum temporale (PT), considered a central node of the human language network. Several lines of evidence indicate a role for genetic mechanisms in the emergence of PT asymmetry; however, the genetic determinants of cerebral asymmetries have remained elusive. Studies in humans suggest that there is heritability of brain asymmetries of the PT, but this has not been explored to any extent in chimpanzees. Furthermore, the potential influence of non-genetic factors has raised questions about the reproducibility of earlier observations of PT asymmetry reported in chimpanzees. As such, the present study was aimed at examining both the heritability of phenotypic asymmetries in PT morphology, as well as their reproducibility. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we evaluated morphological asymmetries of PT surface area (mm2) and mean depth (mm) in captive chimpanzees (n = 291) derived from two genetically isolated populations. Our results confirm that chimpanzees exhibit a significant population-level leftward asymmetry for PT surface area, as well as significant heritability in the surface area and mean depth of the PT. These results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a leftward bias in PT asymmetry in chimpanzees and suggest that genetic mechanisms play a key role in the emergence of anatomical asymmetry in this region.","output":"Reproducibility of leftward planum temporale asymmetries in two genetically isolated populations of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: PSMA PET/MRI showed the potential to increase the sensitivity for extraprostatic disease (EPD) assessment over mpMRI; however, the interreader variability for EPD is still high. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether quantitative PSMA and mpMRI imaging parameters could yield a more robust EPD prediction. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated PCa patients who underwent staging mpMRI and [68Ga]PSMA-PET, followed by radical prostatectomy at our institution between 01.02.2016 and 31.07.2019. Fifty-eight cases with PET/MRI and 15 cases with PET/CT were identified. EPD was determined on histopathology and correlated with quantitative PSMA and mpMRI parameters assessed by two readers: ADC (mm2/1000 s), longest capsular contact (LCC, mm), tumor volume (cm3), PSMA-SUVmax and volume-based parameters using a fixed threshold at SUV > 4 to delineate PSMAtotal (g/ml) and PSMAvol (cm3). The t test was used to compare means, Pearson's test for categorical correlation, and ROC curve to determine the best cutoff. Interclass correlation (ICC) was performed for interreader agreement (95% CI). RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included (64.5  6.0 years; PSA 14.4  17.1 ng/ml), and 31 had EPD (42.5%). From mpMRI, only LCC reached significance (p = 0.005), while both volume-based PET parameters PSMAtotal and PSMAvol were significantly associated with EPD (p = 0.008 and p = 0.004, respectively). On ROC analysis, LCC, PSMAtotal, and PSMAvol reached an AUC of 0.712 (p = 0.002), 0.709 (p = 0.002), and 0.718 (p = 0.002), respectively. ICC was moderate-good for LCC 0.727 (0.565-0.828) and excellent for PSMAtotal and PSMAvol with 0.944 (0.990-0.996) and 0.985 (0.976-0.991), respectively.

Here we analyze flows during breathing and speaking, including phonetic features, using order-of-magnitudes estimates, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments. We document the spatio-temporal structure of the expelled air flow. Phonetic characteristics of plosive sounds like 'P' lead to enhanced directed transport, including jet-like flows that entrain the surrounding air. We highlight three distinct temporal scaling laws for the transport distance of exhaled material including (i) transport over a short distance ($<$ 0.5 m) in a fraction of a second, with large angular variations due to the complexity of speech, (ii) a longer distance, approximately 1 m, where directed transport is driven by individual vortical puffs corresponding to plosive sounds, and (iii) a distance out to about 2 m, or even further, where sequential plosives in a sentence, corresponding effectively to a train of puffs, create conical, jet-like flows. The latter dictates the long-time transport in a conversation. We believe that this work will inform thinking about the role of ventilation, aerosol transport in disease transmission for humans and other animals, and yield a better understanding of linguistic aerodynamics, i.e., aerophonetics.","output":"Speech can produce jet-like transport relevant to asymptomatic spreading of virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in France and to identify the populations most exposed during the first epidemic wave. METHODS: Random selection of individuals aged 15 years or over, from the national tax register (96% coverage). Socio-economic data, migration history, and living conditions were collected via self-computer-assisted-web or computer-assisted-telephone interviews. Home self-sampling was performed for a random subsample, to detect IgG antibodies against spike protein (Euroimmun), and neutralizing antibodies with in-house assays, in dried blood spots (DBS). RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 134,391 participants from May 2nd to June 2st, 2020, including 17,441 eligible for DBS 12,114 of whom were tested. ELISA-S seroprevalence was 4.5% [95% CI 3.9C5.0] overall, reaching up to 10% in the two most affected areas. High-density residences, larger household size, having reported a suspected COVID-19 case in the household, working in healthcare, being of intermediate age and non-daily tobacco smoking were independently associated with seropositivity, whereas living with children or adolescents did not remain associated after adjustment for household size. Adjustment for both residential density and household size accounted for much of the higher seroprevalence in immigrants born outside Europe, twice that in French natives in univariate analysis.

During the winter campaign, indoor PM2.5 was found mainly associated with particle penetration inside the rooms from outdoors, because of the high outdoor PM2.5 levels in the season. Such pollution winter episodes occur frequently in the study region, due to the combined contributions of strong anthropogenic emissions and stable atmospheric conditions. The concentrations of indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and CO2 increased with the number of occupants (humans and pets), as likely associated with consequent higher emissions through breathing and metabolic processes. They also varied with occupants' daily activities, like cooking and cleaning.

As biofilm is a complex community, the members interact with each other, which can be a key issue in future studies designed to develop effective treatments. To understand how a patient gets to the stage of the late-onset (previously termed chronic) periodontitis or develops other, in some cases life-threatening, diseases, it is crucial to identify the microbial composition of the biofilm and the mechanisms behind its pathogenicity.

The pathobiology of this virus is still incompletely known, and it is therefore important to explore the impact of COVID-19 infections on olfactory and gustatory functions. We aimed to review current evidence on olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions caused by COVID-19. METHODS: This study was a narrative review performed in 2020 to investigate the olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions of the COVID-19. We searched eight keywords in six databases to determine the related documents on the main objective of the study. To discover studies meeting the inclusion criteria, the authors screened the titles and abstracts of the identified articles. The appropriate studies were included and their results were discussed to make the final selection. RESULTS: We have studied 24 current articles on the olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions due to COVID-19. A review of current studies has shown that we have a surge in the spread of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions that happened during the epidemic of COVID-19 infection. Most studies (95.8%) have confirmed the symptoms of anosmia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A review of current studies showed that, in addition to anosmia, evidence of ageusia and dysgeusia (parageusia) was also seen in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of our study support recent reports that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues and cause olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions. These findings may aid future research on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 consequences.","output":"Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a review of current evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) faces compelling challenges.

Due to the rigidity of the skull, edema-induced increase of intracranial fluid significantly complicates severe CNS injuries by raising intracranial pressure and compromising perfusion. Mortality due to cerebral edema is high. With mortality rates up to 80% in severe cases of stroke, it is the leading cause of death within the first week. Similarly, cerebral edema is devastating for patients of TBI, accounting for up to 50% mortality. Currently, the available treatments for cerebral edema include hypothermia, osmotherapy, and surgery. However, these treatments only address the symptoms and often elicit adverse side effects, potentially in part due to non-specificity. There is an urgent need to identify effective pharmacological treatments for cerebral edema. Currently, ion channels represent the third-largest target class for drug development, but their roles in cerebral edema remain ill-defined. The present review aims to provide an overview of the proposed roles of ion channels and transporters (including aquaporins, SUR1-TRPM4, chloride channels, glucose transporters, and proton-sensitive channels) in mediating cerebral edema in acute ischemic stroke and TBI. We also focus on the pharmacological inhibitors for each target and potential therapeutic strategies that may be further pursued for the treatment of cerebral edema.","output":"Drug development in targeting ion channels for brain edema"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To examine perceived stress in migrants guided by Bornstein's Specificity Principle in Acculturation Science (BSPAS) theoretical framework.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted millions of lives globally. To learn more about this disease and find potential diagnostic, treatment, and preventative products, the healthcare community has initiated a staggering number of clinical trials. Clinicaltrials.gov was reviewed to determine the types of sponsors who are conducting COVID-19 studies. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Clinicaltrials.gov was searched using terms COVID-19 and SARS-Cov-2. Search results were further defined to include only Interventional studies. Of these, only studies with sites located in the United States were selected and for which the Condition included at least one of the following terms: COVID, COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, SARS, or 2019-nCoV'. Study sponsors were then categorized as: (1) commercial, (2) academic, or (3) other, based on Sponsor information within each study listing. A Google search was conducted for any sponsor that was not easily categorized to obtain additional information to support the proper assessment of sponsor type. The types of sponsors were analyzed over time using the First Posted date of each study listing. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: A total of 3662 studies were retrieved, of which 2075 were Interventional studies. The studies were further reduced to 681 studies by including only United States sites and the desired Condition. The percentage of studies from this refined dataset, by sponsor type, were found to be 63% academic, 34% commercial, and 3% other. The relationship between time and sponsor type demonstrated that academic sponsors had the highest percentage of study postings in the first month (March) of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to commercial and other sponsors. Following this first month, academic study postings gradually declined, while commercial sponsors had an increase in postings per month into July, followed by a gradual decline. Few other sponsor type postings were made and occurred primarily in August. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The number and timing of listings may be a reflection of study intention and regulatory pathway requirements. Additional variables, such as inconsistent terminology, collaborators, funding, and study start date may influence results. Further analysis may reveal how modification of listing information may result in expedited pandemic response.","output":"48842 Sponsor types of US interventional COVID-19 studies listed in ClinicalTrials.gov"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of the intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation based on three methods using artificial intelligence (AI) and one formula using no AI.

The theoretical postoperative refractions were calculated using the Kane and the Pearl-DGS methods and a vergence based formula (Barrett Universal II, BUII). The differences between the manifest and objective postoperative refractions and the predicted refractions were calculated. The percentage of eyes within 0.5 D and 1.0 D prediction error (PE), the mean, and the median absolute errors (MAE and MedAE) were also determined. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 69.48 years; the axial length was between 21.19 and 25.39 mm. The number of eyes within 0.5/1.0 D PE was 96/108 (84.21%/94.73%) using the Hill-RBF 2.0 method, 92/107 (80.70%/93.85%) with the Kane method, 91/107 (79.82%/93.85%) with the Pearl-DGS method, and 91/106 (79.82%/92.98%) with the BUII formula, using subjective refraction.

We show here that the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing mesothelin and the enhanced MVA virus missing the immunosuppressive A35 gene and expressing mesothelin were both safe in mice and were able to induce IFN-gamma secreting T cells in response to mesothelin expressing tumor cells. In addition, the MVA virus has oncolytic properties in vitro as it can replicate in and kill Panc02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line tumor cells, even though it is unable to replicate in most mammalian cells. Deletion of the A35 gene in MVA improved T cell responses as expected. However, we were unable to demonstrate inhibition of Panc02 tumor growth in immunocompetent mice with pre-vaccination of mice, boosts, or even intratumoral injections of the recombinant viruses.

The results showed that from March 1 to 21, 2020, the average tropospheric NO2 concentration was 214.4 1013 molecule cm-2 over India, and it subsequently decreased by 12.1% over the next four weeks. An increase of 0.8% in tropospheric NO2 concentrations was observed for the same period in 2019 and hence, the reduced tropospheric NO2 concentrations can be attributed to restricted anthropogenic activities during the lockdown. In the absence of significant activities, the contribution of various sources was estimated, and the emissions from biomass burning were identified as a major source of tropospheric NO2 during the lockdown. The findings of this study provide an opportunity to understand the mechanism of tropospheric NO2 emissions over India, in order to improve air quality modeling and management strategies.","output":"COVID-19 lockdown and its impact on tropospheric NO2 concentrations over India using satellite-based data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is characterized by dysregulated immune responses, metabolic dysfunction and adverse effects on the function of multiple organs To understand host responses to COVID-19 pathophysiology, we combined transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to identify molecular markers in peripheral blood and plasma samples of 66 COVID-19-infected patients experiencing a range of disease severities and 17 healthy controls A large number of expressed genes, proteins, metabolites, and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) exhibit strong associations with various clinical parameters Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients suggesting a potential impact on tissue function Chronic activation of neutrophils, IFN-I signaling, and a high level of inflammatory cytokines were observed in patients with severe disease progression In contrast, COVID-19-infected patients experiencing milder disease symptoms showed robust T-cell responses Finally, we identified genes, proteins, and exRNAs as potential biomarkers that might assist in predicting the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection These data refine our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical progress of COVID-19 SYNOPSIS image Proteomics, metabolomics and RNAseq data map immune responses in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity, revealing molecular makers associated with disease progression and alterations of tissue-specific proteins A multi-omics profiling of the host response to SARS-CoV2 infection in 66 clinically diagnosed and laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients and 17 uninfected controls Significant correlations between multi-omics data and key clinical parameters Alteration of tissue-specific proteins and exRNAs Enhanced activation of immune responses is associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis Biomarkers to predict COVID-19 clinical outcomes pending clinical validation as prospective marker","output":"Blood molecular markers associated with COVID-19 immunopathology and multi-organ damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marine archaea are a significant component of the global oceanic ecosystems, including the polar oceans. However, only a few attempts have been made to study archaea in the high Arctic fjords. Given the importance of Archaea in carbon and nitrogen cycling, it is imperative to explore their diversity and community composition in the high Arctic fjords, such as Kongsfjorden (Svalbard). In the present study, we evaluated archaeal diversity and community composition in the size-fractionated microbial population, viz-a-viz free-living (FL; 0.2C3 m) and particle-attached (PA; > 3 m) using archaeal V3CV4 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our results indicate that the overall archaeal community in the surface water of Kongsfjorden was dominated by the members of the marine group-II (MGII) archaea, followed by the MGI group members, including Nitrosopumilaceae and Nitrososphaeraceae. Although a clear niche partitioning between PA and FL archaeal communities was not observed, 2 OTUs among 682 OTUs, and 3 ASVs out of 1932 ASVs were differentially abundant among the fractions. OTU001/ASV0002, classified as MGIIa, was differentially abundant in the PA fraction. OTU006/ASV0006/ASV0010 affiliated with MGIIb were differentially abundant in the FL fraction. Particulate organic nitrogen and C:N ratio were the most significant variables (P < 0.05) explaining the observed variation in the FL and PA archaeal communities, respectively. These results indicate an exchange between archaeal communities or a generalist lifestyle switching between FL and PA fractions. Besides, the particles' elemental composition (carbon and nitrogen) seems to play an essential role in shaping the PA archaeal communities in the surface waters of Kongsfjorden.

According to recent trials, up to 16% of patients require emergency conversion to general anesthesia during mechanical thrombectomy. This study investigated the procedural and clinical outcomes after emergency conversion in comparison with local anesthesia, conscious sedation, and general anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 254 patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute large-vessel occlusion. The procedure was started with the patient either under local anesthesia, conscious sedation, or general anesthesia. Emergency conversion was defined as induction of general anesthesia during mechanical thrombectomy. The primary outcomes were successful reperfusion (TICI 2b/3) and functional independence (mRS at 90 days, 2). RESULTS Twenty-five patients (9.8%) required emergency conversion to general anesthesia. The time from admission to flow restoration was increased under general anesthesia (median, 137 minutes) and emergency conversion (median, 138 minutes) compared with local anesthesia (median 110 minutes). After adjustment for confounders, emergency conversion to general anesthesia and primary general anesthesia had comparable chances of successful reperfusion (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.31-5.25). Patients with emergency conversion had a tendency toward higher chances of functional independence (OR = 4.48; 95% CI, 0.49-40.86) compared with primary general anesthesia, but not compared with local anesthesia (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.14-5.11) and conscious sedation (OR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.17-6.53). CONCLUSIONS Patients with emergency conversion did not have lower chances of successful reperfusion or functional independence compared those with primary general anesthesia, and time to flow restoration was also similar. We found no evidence supporting the primary induction of general anesthesia in patients at risk for emergency conversion.","output":"Emergency Conversion to General Anesthesia Is a Tolerable Risk in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Thrombectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID 19 infection is unarguably the worst pandemic of this century.

There is a pressing need for informative biomarkers to diagnose liver disease early in its course to prevent severe disease for which no efficient treatment is yet available. Here, we propose the concept of a cellular pathway as a functional biomarker, whose monitorization may inform normal and pathological status.

The assay is compliant with Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) guidelines and has been included in the protein quantification assays that can be accessed through the assay portal at the CPTAC web page. To test the feasibility of the assay, we conducted a retrospective, proof-of-concept study on a collection of liver samples from healthy controls and from patients with cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our results indicate a significant reconfiguration of 1CM upon HCC development resulting from a process that can already be identified in cirrhosis. Our findings indicate that the systematic and integrated quantification of 1CM enzymes is a promising cell function-based biomarker for patient stratification, although further experiments with larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings.

Objective: To examine whether remdesivir administered with or without corticosteroids for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with more rapid clinical improvement in a racially/ethnically diverse population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective comparative effectiveness research study was conducted from March 4 to August 29, 2020, in a 5-hospital health system in the Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC, area. Of 2483 individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection assessed by polymerase chain reaction, those who received remdesivir were matched to infected individuals who did not receive remdesivir using time-invariant covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, body mass index, and do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate orders) and time-dependent covariates (ratio of peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, C-reactive protein level, complete white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, albumin level, alanine aminotransferase level, glomerular filtration rate, dimerized plasmin fragment D [D-dimer] level, and oxygen device). An individual in the remdesivir group with k days of treatment was matched to a control patient who stayed in the hospital at least k days (5 days maximum) beyond the matching day. Exposures: Remdesivir treatment with or without corticosteroid administration. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was rate of clinical improvement (hospital discharge or decrease of 2 points on the World Health Organization severity score), and the secondary outcome, mortality at 28 days. An additional outcome was clinical improvement and time to death associated with combined remdesivir and corticosteroid treatment. Results: Of 2483 consecutive admissions, 342 individuals received remdesivir, 184 of whom also received corticosteroids and 158 of whom received remdesivir alone. For these 342 patients, the median age was 60 years (interquartile range, 46-69 years), 189 (55.3%) were men, and 276 (80.7%) self-identified as non-White race/ethnicity. Remdesivir recipients had a shorter time to clinical improvement than matched controls without remdesivir treatment (median, 5.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-8.0 days] vs 7.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-10.0 days]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.22-1.79]). Remdesivir recipients had a 28-day mortality rate of 7.7% (22 deaths) compared with 14.0% (40 deaths) among matched controls, but this difference was not statistically significant in the time-to-death analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.38-1.28). The addition of corticosteroids to remdesivir was not associated with a reduced hazard of death at 28 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.67-5.57). Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19, receipt of remdesivir was associated with faster clinical improvement in a cohort of predominantly non-White patients.

Naturally occurring or manipulated genetic defects of tumor necrosis factor, interleukins-1, -6, -12, and -15, and interferon-gamma are examined for their increased susceptibility to, or protection from, infection. RECENT FINDINGS Interleukin-12p40 and interferon-gamma-blockers may lead to increased incidence of infections with intracellular bacteria, parasites, and fungi. In addition, we may see viral infections with interferon-gamma-blockers. Increased risk of infections is unlikely with either interleukin-1- or interleukin-15-blockers. Interleukin-6-blockers may lead to increased risk of infection with extracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. SUMMARY In tumor necrosis factor knockout mice, increased susceptibility to pathogens are reported that are normally controlled by granuloma formation. In patients treated with tumor necrosis factor-blockers, a two-fold increase of granulomatous infections, predominantly reactivation of latent tuberculosis, is found. The infections detected in tumor necrosis factor knockout mice were accurate for predicting the infections observed when using tumor necrosis factor-blockers. If a similar correlation exists for other cytokines, the use of interferon-gamma and interleukin-12p40 blockers, and possibly interleukin-6 blockers, will lead to an increased risk for severe infections.

Limited information exists regarding the interrelationship between CD47 expression and tumour-associated macrophage-related immuno-microenvironment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These factors may predict novel immunotherapy efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD47 and PD-L1 expression was retrospectively assessed in 191 resected NSCLC specimens via immunohistochemistry. Forty-six patients with pulmonary infectious diseases were enrolled as the control group. The infiltration of macrophages (M2 and M1) and CD8+ T-lymphocytes was evaluated via dual-immunofluorescence staining. Targeted DNA sequencing was performed on NSCLC specimens. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox model. RESULTS: Using 2+/3+ as a CD47 positive (CD47pos) expression cut-off, the prevalence of CD47pos expression in NSCLC was 33.0% (63/191), significantly higher than in pulmonary infectious diseases. CD47pos expression was significantly higher in female, non-smoking and adenocarcinoma patients (p=0.020, p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, CD47pos expression was significantly correlated with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (p<0.001). The expression of CD47 (H-score) in NSCLC was negatively correlated with tumour PD-L1 expression (p=0.0346) and tumour mutation burden (p=0.0107). CD47pos expression was independently correlated with poor disease-free survival in patients with resected NSCLC in multivariate Cox regression analysis (p=0.035). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the demographic, molecular and immuno-microenvironment characteristics of CD47 expression in NSCLC.

The coronavirus has caused a dramatic toll of deaths and imposed a severe burden, both from a societal and economic point of view. COVID-19 has challenged health systems, straining and overwhelming healthcare facilities and settings, including hospital and community pharmacies. On the other hand, COVID-19 has propelled several changes. During the last decades, pharmacy has shifted from being products-based and patient-facing to being services-based and patient-centered. Pharmacies have transitioned from being compounding centers devoted to the manipulation of materia medica to pharmaceutical centers, clinical pharmacies and fully integrated medical-pharmaceutical networks, providing a significant range of non-prescribing services. Moreover, roles, duties and responsibilities of pharmacists have paralleled such historical changes and have known a gradual expansion, incorporating new skills and reflecting new societal demands and challenges. The COVID-19 outbreak has unearthed new opportunities for pharmacists: community and hospital pharmacists have, indeed, played a key role during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that a fully integrated, inter-sectoral and inter-professional collaboration is necessary to face crises and public health emergencies. Preliminary, emerging evidence seems to suggest that, probably, a new era in the history of pharmacies (the post-COVID-19 post-pharmaceutical care era) has begun, with community pharmacists acquiring more professional standing, being authentic heroes and frontline health workers.","output":"The Role of Hospital and Community Pharmacists in the Management of COVID-19: Towards an Expanded Definition of the Roles, Responsibilities, and Duties of the Pharmacist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis is key to improve cancer outcomes, and most cancers are diagnosed in primary care after initial symptomatic presentation. Emerging evidence suggests an increase in avoidable cancer deaths owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: To understand GPs' views on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical assessment of possible cancer. DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative semi-structured interview study with GPs from the East of England. METHOD: GPs were purposively sampled based on age, sex, and years of experience. Interviews were conducted via Zoom or Microsoft Teams in August and September 2020. Transcribed recordings were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. The Model of Pathways to Treatment guided the analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified across 23 interviews on GP views on the impact of: (1) changes in patient help-seeking behaviour on symptoms at presentation; (2) remote consultations on managing patients with possible cancer symptoms; and (3) the COVID-19 pandemic on triaging and referring patients with possible cancer. There were positive changes to practice, but concerns were raised about the adequacy of remote consultations for assessing symptoms. Some GPs reported delayed cancer diagnoses, and uncertainty about how backlog in referrals would be managed. CONCLUSION: This study provides new evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on assessing symptomatic patients. Recommendations are made to inform safe and effective primary care clinical practice.

Women veterans who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had 4 times higher mortality risk than women veterans who tested negative (Hazard Ratio 3.8, 95% Confidence Interval CI 2.92 to 4.89) but had lower risk of cardiovascular events (Odds Ratio OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92) and developing new heart disease conditions within 60 days (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.77). Older age, obesity (BMI > 30), and prior CVD and COPD conditions were positively associated with increased mortality in 60 days. Despite a higher infection rate among minority women veterans, there was no significant race difference in mortality, cardiovascular events, or onset of heart disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased short-term mortality risk among women veterans similarly across race groups. However, there was no evidence of increased cardiovascular disease incidence in 60 days. A longer follow-up of women veterans who tested positive is warranted.","output":"COVID-19 associated mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes among US women veterans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Incidentally diagnosed, asymptomatic, paranasal fungus ball might occasionally undergo spontaneous healing.

The virus has taken spread in India as well, whereas of June 13, 2020, 3,09,603 cases are confirmed with 8,890 deaths and 1,54,330 recovery. It this situation, it is vital to know the potential danger posed by the pandemic and the epidemic trajectory. In this paper, the basic reproduction number (R0 ) of COVID-19 from the early epidemic data in India is estimated. The course of the pandemic in India as well as the worst affected seven states in India, namely Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal is also analyzed. The early outbreak data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India, are collected for the analysis. The two R packages R0 and earlyR to estimate the basic reproduction number are used. An attempt is also made to forecast near-future incidence cases based on statistical methods. The results show that R0 varies from 1.53 to 3.25 accounting to different methodologies and serial intervals adopted, whereas WHO estimations are from 2 to 2.5. Due to effect of lockdown, the time-dependent reproduction number has reduced to near about 1.22. It is predicted that by July 15, cumulative number of COVID-19 cases may reach around 1.2 million if the current effective reproduction number remains same over the next one month. Finally, it can be concluded that in the coming months, the novel coronavirus will pose a severe challenge to the Indian healthcare system. Thus, it is necessary to predict how the virus may spread so that the healthcare system may be prepared in advance.

Our objective was to describe state variation in the effect of initial social distancing policies and non-essential business (NEB) closure on infection rates early in 2020. METHODS: We used an interrupted time series study design to estimate the total effect of all state social distancing orders, including NEB closure, shelter-in-place, and stay-at-home orders, on cumulative COVID-19 cases for each state. Data included the daily number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for all 50 states and Washington, DC from the New York Times database (January 21 to May 7, 2020). We predicted cumulative daily cases and deaths using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a log link for two models. RESULTS: Social distancing was associated with a 15.4% daily reduction (Relative Risk = 0.846; Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.832, 0.859) in COVID-19 cases. After 3 weeks, social distancing prevented nearly 33 million cases nationwide, with about half (16.5 million) of those prevented cases among residents of the Mid-Atlantic census division (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania). Eleven states prevented more than 10,000 cases per 100,000 residents within 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of social distancing on the infection rate of COVID-19 in the US varied substantially across states, and effects were largest in states with highest community spread.

CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) has the potential to transform diagnostics due to its programmability. However, many of the CRISPR-based detection methods are reliant on either a multi-step process involving amplification or elaborate guide RNA designs. A complete one-pot detection reaction using alternative Cas effector endonucleases has been proposed to overcome these challenges. Yet, current approaches using Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus Cas12b (AapCas12b) are limited by its thermal instability at optimum reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reaction temperatures. Herein, we demonstrate that a novel Cas12b from Brevibacillus sp. SYP-B805 (referred to as BrCas12b) has robust trans-cleavage activity at ideal RT-LAMP conditions. A competitive profiling study of BrCas12b against Cas12b homologs from other bacteria genera underscores the potential of BrCas12b in the development of new diagnostics. As a proof-of-concept, we incorporated BrCas12b into an RT-LAMP-mediated one-pot reaction system, coined CRISPR-SPADE (CRISPR Single Pot Assay for Detecting Emerging VOCs) to enable rapid, differential detection of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) in 205 clinical samples. Notably, a BrCas12b detection signal was observed within 1-3 minutes of amplification, achieving an overall 98.1% specificity, 91.2% accuracy, and 88.1% sensitivity within 30 minutes. Significantly, for samples with high viral load (Ct value [] 30), 100% accuracy and sensitivity were attained. To facilitate dissemination and global implementation of the assay, we combined the lyophilized one-pot reagents with a portable multiplexing device capable of interpreting fluorescence signals at a fraction of the cost of a qPCR system. With relaxed design requirements, one-pot detection, and simple instrumentation, this assay has the capability to advance future diagnostics.","output":"A Thermostable Cas12b from Brevibacillus Leverages One-pot Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Heart transplant (HT) recipients are at high risk for Covid-19 infection, and data are limited about the efficacy of vaccination in this unique population. We sought to describe the presentation and outcomes of a cohort of HT patients with Covid-19 infection despite prior vaccination.

Baseline clinical characteristics, serial echocardiographic parameters, laboratory testing, medication regimens, clinical presentation and clinical course were collected. Results A total of 237 were vaccinated with an incidence of 7 breakthrough infections (3%). Patients were predominantly male (71%) with a median age of 50 years old. The average BMI was 32.89. Hypertension (86%), diabetes (57%), and hyperlipidemia (43%) were common. Nearly all (71%) of patients were on 3 classes of immunosuppressive therapy, and nearly half (43%) had a history of rejection. Five patients (72%) received Pfizer-BioNTech, 1 patient (14%) received Moderna, and 1 patient (14%) received the Johnson & Johnson vaccination. One patient had a prior history of Covid-19 infection before vaccine availability. Patients were on average 6.74 (3.8-8.4) years out from transplantation. The most common presentation was dyspnea (71%), cough (57%), and fever (43%). Seventy one percent were hospitalized, and 29% were admitted to the ICU.

While impacts on mortality and, to some extent, short-term migration flows are beginning to be documented, it is too early to measure actual consequences for family demography. To gain insight into potential future consequences of the lockdown for family demography, we use cross-national Google Trends search data to explore whether trends in searches for words related to fertility, relationship formation, and relationship dissolution changed following lockdowns compared to average, pre-lockdown levels in Europe and the United States. Because lockdowns were not widely anticipated or simultaneous in timing or intensity, we exploit variability over time and between countries (and U.S. states). We use a panel event-study design and difference-in-differences methods, and account for seasonal trends and average country-level (or state-level) differences in searches. We find statistically significant impacts of lockdown timing on changes in searches for terms such as wedding and those related to condom use, emergency contraception, pregnancy tests, and abortion, but little evidence of changes in searches related to fertility. Impacts for union formation and dissolution tended to only be statistically significant at the start of a lockdown with a return to average-levels about 2 to 3 months after lockdown initiation, particularly in Europe. Compared to Europe, returns to average search levels were less evident for the U.S., even 2 to 3 months after lockdowns were introduced. This may be due to the fact, in the U.S., health and social policy responses were less demarcated than in Europe, such that economic uncertainty was likely of larger magnitude. Such pandemic-related economic uncertainty may therefore have the potential to slightly increase already existing polarization in family formation behaviours in the U.S. Alongside contributing to the wider literature on economic uncertainty and family behaviors, this paper also proposes strategies for efficient use of Google Trends data, such as making relative comparisons and testing sensitivity to outliers, and provides a template and cautions for their use in demographic research when actual demographic trends data are not yet available.","output":"COVID-19 lockdowns and demographically-relevant Google Trends: A cross-national analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical pandemics disrupt human activities and threaten the existence of man.

The cis and trans requirements for Mu phage-mediated transposition, which include the L/R ends of the Mu DNA, the transposition factors MuA and MuB, and the cis/trans functioning of the E element as an enhancer, are presented. Mini-Mu(LR)/(LER) units are Mu derivatives that lack most of the Mu genes but contain the L/R ends or a properly arranged E element in cis to the L/R ends. The dual-component system, which consists of an integrative plasmid with a mini-Mu and an easily eliminated helper plasmid encoding inducible transposition factors, is described in detail as a tool for the integration/amplification of recombinant DNAs. This chromosomal editing method is based on replicative transposition through the formation of a cointegrate that can be resolved in a recombination-dependent manner.

We find especially in Vajpayee and Singh that their traits can help explain Indias foreign policy roles and in Modi (first term only) a leader vulnerable to contextual winds.

However, two heavy haze pollution episodes still occurred in Beijing. In this study, we use the air pollutants, aerosol number concentration, and meteorological elements data in Beijing, combined with the HYSPLIT model, to calculate the potential source contribution factor(PSCF) and concentration weight trajectory(CWT), and analyze the characteristics of evolution and potential source apportionment of atmospheric pollutants during the two episodes. The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions had great impacts on the diurnal variations of PM2.5 and black carbon(BC), while small impacts on the diurnal variations of CO, NO2, SO2, and O3. The primary pollutant was PM2.5 during the two haze pollution episodes, and the haze1 episode was mainly local pollution, while haze 2 was mainly local and external transportation pollution. The spectrum of aerosol number concentration was unimodal under different processes, with the peak located at 0.3 m. During the haze episodes, the number concentration in the size range of 0.2-0.5 m increased 3.3-13.6 times that of the clean days. The mass concentration contributions of BCliquid to BC in different processes were 64.8%-85.1%.

The influenza cases were stratified between non-carnival and carnival regions. Distributions of influenza cases were plotted with time and compared between regions. A similar investigation in the early outbreak of COVID-19 was also conducted using open data from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between non-carnival and carnival regions were broadly similar.

This study focuses on the development of three-dimensional separated flow over the wing, and discuss flow structures formed on the wing surface as well as in the far field wake. Vorticity is introduced into the flow in a predominantly two-dimensional manner. The vortex sheet from the wing tip rolls up around the free end to form the tip vortex. At its inception, the tip vortex is weak and its effect is spatially confined. As the flow around the tip separates, the tip effects extend farther in the spanwise direction, generating noticeable three dimensionality in the wake. For low-aspect-ratio wings, the wake remains stable due to the strong downwash over the entire span. Increasing the aspect ratio allows unsteady vortical flow to emerge away from the tip at sufficiently high angles of attack. These unsteady vortices shed and form closed vortical loops. For higher-aspect-ratio wings, the tip effects retard the near-tip shedding process, which desynchronizes from the two-dimensional shedding over the mid-span region, yielding vortex dislocation. At high angles of attack, the tip vortex exhibits noticeable undulations due to the strong interaction with the unsteady shedding vortices. The spanwise distribution of force coefficients is related to the three-dimensional wake dynamics and the tip effects. Vortical elements in the wake that are responsible for the generation of lift and drag forces are identified through the force element analysis. We note that at high angles of attack, a stationary vortical structure forms at the leading edge near the tip, giving rise to locally high lift and drag forces. The analysis performed here reveals how the vortical flow around the tip influences the separation physics, the global wake dynamics, and the spanwise force distributions.","output":"On the formation of three-dimensional flows over finite-aspect-ratio wings under tip effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 virus started to outbreak in China in the year January 2020. Contact tracing is an open-minded measure of control that applies to an extensive range of transmissible diseases.

While there is an abundance of literature documenting corticosteroid related osteonecrosis, there is no consensus as to the relative risk of osteonecrosis after administration of steroids via parenteral, oral, topical, inhaled and other routes. This risk is an important prognostic indicator because identification and conservative intervention can potentially reduce morbidity associated with aggressive surgical treatment of osteonecrosis. This paper provides insight into establishing guidelines related to the risk of developing osteonecrosis as a result of corticosteroid use. Case studies, retrospective studies and prospective studies in humans on different corticosteroids and varied dosages were assessed. Most cases of osteonecrosis are secondary to systemically administered corticosteroids and/or high dose daily therapy, particularly in patients with underlying comorbidities including connective tissue diseases, hyperlipidemia, or previous trauma. Previous case reports of osteonecrosis related to inhaled or topical use of steroids are complicated by the fact that in the great majority of cases, the patients are also treated with systemic steroids prior to the development of osteonecrosis. Based on the literature, a set of recommendations regarding the risk of osteonecrosis in patients on steroids was formulated.","output":"Steroid induced osteonecrosis: An analysis of steroid dosing risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathological signaling in the lung induced by particulate matter (PM) air pollution partially overlaps with that provoked by COVID-19, the pandemic disease caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Given the linkage between mitochondrial functionality, ion channels, and inflamm-aging, the ability of metformin to target mitochondrial electron transport and prevent ROS/CRAC-mediated IL-6 release might illuminate new therapeutic avenues to quell the raging of the cytokine and thrombotic-like storms that are the leading causes of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in older people. The incorporation of infection rates, severity and lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infections as new outcomes of metformin usage in elderly populations at risk of developing severe COVID-19, together with the assessment of bronchial/serological titers of inflammatory cytokines and D-dimers, could provide a novel mechanistic basis for the consideration of metformin as a therapeutic strategy against the inflammatory and thrombotic states underlying the gerolavic traits of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Metformin and SARS-CoV-2: mechanistic lessons on air pollution to weather the cytokine/thrombotic storm in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) caused widespread infections that were linked to Guillain-Barr syndrome in adults and congenital malformation in fetuses, and epidemiological data suggest that ZIKV infection can induce protective antibody responses.

In this sense, we address a new research perspective in the POI Recommendation field, proposing a re-ordering method to be applied after any RS and improve the POIs located nearby from the users geolocation. Our assumption is that POIs located on the sub-areas with more activity of a user are more interesting than POIs from new sub-areas.

Design Population based cohort study. Setting Survey data from the University College London COVID-19 Social Study. Participants Data from 633 adults belonging to ethnic minority groups who took part in the study from 23 July 2020 to 14 June 2021 were included. Experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination occurring since the start of the first lockdown were collected in the last week of July 2020. Structural equation modelling was used to model the direct effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on covid-19 vaccine refusal, as well as the indirect effects through low trust in the central UK government and the UK health service to handle the pandemic. The model adjusted for a range of demographic and covid-19-related covariates. Main outcome measures Data on covid-19 vaccination status was collected from 23 December 2020 to 14 June 2021 and operationalised as having had or agreed to have at least one dose versus having been offered but turned it down (refusal). Results Nearly one in ten (6.7%) who had refused a covid-19 vaccine reported having experienced racial/ethnic discrimination in a medical setting since the start of the pandemic and had experienced twice as many incidents of racial/ethnic discrimination than those who had accepted the vaccine. The total effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on refusing a covid-19 vaccine was nearly 4-fold (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4 to 10.9) and was mediated by low trust in the health system to handle the pandemic (indirect effect: OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.4). Conclusions Findings underscore the importance of addressing racial/ethnic discrimination in order to increase covid-19 vaccine uptake amongst ethnic minority adults.

However, despite the high occurrence of rs12252-CC genotype in Chinese population (~25%), severe influenza infection is rare. The aim of study is to determine whether rs12252-CC individuals have pre-existing antibody responses to previous seasonal influenza infections. Cohort and Method: A total 99 young healthy volunteers (18C20 years) were recruited and received an influenza seasonal Vaccination [A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2), A/California/7/2009 (pdm09H1N1) and B/Jeep/3073/2013-like virus (Flu-B)]. Plasma and gDNA was isolated from each volunteer before, and 14, 28, 180, 360, and 540 days after vaccination. Additionally, 68 elderlies (>65 years) were also recruited as a control group to compare the levels of antibodies at baseline between the young adults and the elderly. For each sample IFITM3 rs12252 genotype was determined and antibody levels in response to pdmH1N1, H3N2 and Influenza B infection were measured for each time point. Results: We found a significantly higher level of pre-existing antibodies to pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus (pdm09H1N1) but not to H3N2 or FluB in CC donors in comparison with CT/TT donors prior to vaccination. No impact of IFITM3 genotype in boosting influenza specific antibodies in young adults within 1 year after receiving seasonal influenza vaccination was observed. In addition, there was no difference in pdm09H1N1 specific antibody levels observed in the elderly cohort between volunteers carrying different IFITM3 genotypes. Higher levels of antibodies to pdmH1N1 were observed in elderly CC carriers when compared to the young CC carriers, but this trend was not replicated in TT carriers. Conclusion: IFITM3-rs12252 CC carriers exhibit a high level of pre-existing immunity to pdm09H1N1 compared to TT carriers in the young cohort. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms exist which might contribute to viral control in patients carrying the rs12252-CC genotype who do not become sick after flu infection. However, such a potential compensatory effect appears to be lost overtime, as evidenced in the elderly cohort. If this compensatory mechanism is lost, it may make the CC carrying elderly more susceptible to severe influenza infection.","output":"High Level Antibody Response to Pandemic Influenza H1N1/09 Virus Is Associated With Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein-3 rs12252-CC in Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a minimalist compartmental model to study the impact of mobility restrictions in Italy during the Covid-19 outbreak. We show that an early lockdown shifts the epidemic in time, while that beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, the epidemic tend to restart after lifting the restrictions. As a consequence, specific mitigation strategies must be introduced. We characterize the relative importance of different broad strategies by accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and demography. First, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities, in which social interactions between age classs occur. Due to the sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix, once started the epidemics tend to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of solutions specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Second, we show that social contacts between age classes play a fundamental role and that measures which take into account the age structure of the population can provide a significant contribution to mitigate the rebound effects.

Here, we sought to further understand and define the role of TAp63 in the pathophysiology of CLL. First, we found that elevated TAp63 expression levels are linked with adverse clinical outcomes, including disease relapse and shorter time-to-first treatment and overall survival. Next, prompted by the fact that TAp63 participates in an NF-B/TAp63/BCL2 anti-apoptotic axis in activated mature normal B cells, we explored molecular links between TAp63 and BCL2 also in CLL. We documented a strong correlation at both the protein and the mRNA levels, alluding to the potential prosurvival role of TAp63. This claim was supported by inducible downregulation of TAp63 expression in the MEC1 CLL cell line using CRISPR, which resulted in downregulation of BCL2 expression. Next, using ChIP-sequencing, we examined whether BCL2 might constitute a transcriptional target of TAp63 and identified a significant binding profile of TAp63 in the BCL2 gene locus, across a genomic region previously characterized as a super-enhancer in CLL. Moreover, we identified high-confidence TAp63 binding regions in genes mainly implicated in immune response and DNA-damage procedures. Finally, we found that up-regulated TAp63 expression levels render CLL cells less responsive to apoptosis induction with the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax. On these grounds, TAp63 appears to act as a positive modulator of BCL2, hence contributing to the anti-apoptotic phenotype that underlies clinical aggressiveness and treatment resistance in CLL.","output":"The Tp63/BCL2 Axis Represents A Novel Mechanism Of Clinical Aggressiveness In Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Single incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS) is recognized as a difficult procedure and surgeons hesitate to perform this technique. We describe our experience of SITS and determine whether SITS can be a routine approach in minimally invasive surgery. METHODS From May 2011 to April 2013, a single operator attempted SITS for 264 cases. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed with regard to age, sex, diagnosis, operation time, hospital stay, need of additional incision, morbidity, and early outcome. RESULTS A number of thoracic diseases and procedures were attempted with SITS including primary (n = 172) or secondary (n = 22) spontaneous pneumothorax, biopsy for lung (n = 29), pleura (n = 3), and mediastinal lymph node (n = 3), mediastinal mass excision (n = 11), empyema decortication (n = 11), lobectomy (n = 6), pulmonary metastasectomy (n = 3), pericardial window formation (n = 3), and hematoma evacuation (n = 1). Of these, 237 cases underwent SITS successfully. However, additional incision was needed in 10.2% (n = 27). Reasons for conversions were as follows: extensive pleural adhesion (n = 14), difficulty in endoscopic stapling (n = 11), bleeding (n = 1), and intolerance of one lung ventilation (n = 1). Conversion rate of empyema was 54.5%, which was the most difficult for SITS. In contrast, the conversion rate of PSP was 4.7%, which means PSP was the most applicable for SITS. Postoperative complications included air leak ( 3 days) (n = 1), wound problem (n = 4), delayed pleural effusion (n = 1), and postoperative bleeding (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS SITS can be a routine approach from simple to more complicated diseases.

However, it has been challenged in some corners of bioethics based on concerns about various harms-to participants, to scientific integrity, and to research bystanders-that may stem from withdrawal. These concerns have become particularly salient in emerging debates about the ethics of controlled human infection (CHI) studies in which participants are intentionally infected with pathogens, often in inpatient settings with extensive follow-up. In this article, I provide support for preserving the right to withdraw from research without penalty and demonstrate that it is also typically justified in the specific context of CHI studies. The right is well aligned with individual freedoms outside the research setting, where autonomous individuals are permitted to engage in behaviors that will foreseeably cause them harm; where they cannot be compelled to satisfy contracts for their services, nor penalized for failure to do so; and where their behavior is not constrained by public health authorities except in extreme circumstances. These freedoms are supported by U.S. law, as well as by ethical analysis that is more globally relevant. The problems associated with the right to withdraw, however, remain. The best approach to addressing them is not to restrict the right but rather to avoid initiating research when withdrawal would be especially problematic. If research proceeds, steps can still be taken to minimize participant withdrawal without infringing the right. Investigators can avoid participant surprise through informed consent focused on a study's most burdensome aspects and promote study completion through financial incentives. Should participants nonetheless seek to withdraw, investigators may attempt to persuade them not to do so by encouraging consideration of the range of potential harms that may result. Researchers conducting CHI studies and other research from which withdrawal might be especially problematic should prepare for the possibility of participant withdrawal, respect participant requests to withdraw without penalty, and incorporate various measures to avoid such requests.","output":"The right to withdraw from controlled human infection studies: Justifications and avoidance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between country-level structural ageism and prevalence of violence against older persons. DESIGN: Country-level ecological study. SETTING: Structural ageism data were drawn from the nationally representative World Values Survey 2010C2014 (WVS), global databases from the WHO, United Nations and the World Bank. Violence data were based on the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of 56 countries that represented 63.1% of the worlds ageing population aged 60 and over across all six of WHO regions. EXPOSURE: Structural ageism, following established structural stigma measures, consisted of two components: (1) discriminatory national policies related to older persons economic, social, civil and political rights, based on the four core components of human rights protection in Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging and (2) prejudicial social norms against older persons, measured by negative attitudes toward older persons in 56 national polls in WVS aggregated to country-level. These components were z scored and combined such that higher score indicated greater structural ageism. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence rates of violence per 100 000 persons aged 70 and over in each country was based on extensive epidemiological surveillance data, survey, clinical data and insurance claims in GBD and compiled by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. RESULTS: There was a wide variation in levels of structural ageism across countries. As predicted, structural ageism was significantly associated with the prevalence rates of violence in multivariate models (=205.7, SE=96.3, p=0.03), after adjusting for relevant covariates. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings.

Finding and isolating these silent carriers is a crucial step in confining the spread of the disease. A sudden loss of the sense of smell has been self-reported by COVID-19 patients across different countries, consistent with expression of the molecular factors mediating SARS-CoV-2 uptake into human olfactory epithelial supporting cells. However, precise quantification of olfactory loss in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers is missing to date. METHODS: To quantify olfactory functions in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, we designed an olfactory-action meter that determines detectability indices at different odor concentrations and an olfactory matching accuracy score using monomolecular odors. The optimization of test parameters allowed us to reliably and accurately assess olfactory deficits in a patient within 20 minutes. FINDINGS: Measurement of detection indices at low concentrations revealed a 50% reduction in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. Further, patients with better detection scores showed significantly reduced olfactory matching accuracies compared to normal healthy subjects. Our quantification of olfactory loss, considering all parameters, identified 82% of the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers with olfactory deficits. However, on subjective evaluation, only 15% of the patients noticed a compromised ability to smell. INTERPRETATION: Compromised olfactory fitness can serve as a strong basis for identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.

Instructors across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines have begun to implement escape room activities as effective and engaging learning tools in their classrooms. For our virtual introductory ecology course in spring 2021, we developed a student-designed escape room assessment which aligned with several course goals and covered a broad range of ecology concepts. The learning objectives of this assignment asked students to (i) create a themed \\"room\\" filled with ecology-based riddles and puzzles that represented a novel virtual escape room for their peers based on an important ecological topic, (ii) summarize and synthesize primary literature into clues and locks to educate their peers about an ecological topic, and (iii) use critical thinking and discussion of ecological topics with peers to solve their peers' escape rooms. We found that while students generated distinct escape room activities and focused on various ecological topics, student scores on this assessment, as well as student feedback, indicated that the escape rooms were conducive to learning, novel, and accessible in the virtual learning environment. We suggest that student-designed escape room assessments are an effective way for students to learn course material in a fun, engaging, and creative manner, and our spring 2021 implementation suggests that this activity may be an effective assessment for online settings.","output":"Design, Discover, and Decipher: Student-Developed Escape Rooms in the Virtual Ecology Classroom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analysis of modern prevention concepts makes it possible to single out individual-oriented preventive concepts, and concepts of socio-political orientation.

In this study, we examine the perceived utility and performance of 3D-printed (3DP) face shields through a survey of frontline workers in Ontario, Canada. Methodology Frontline workers who received community-produced 3DP face shields from the Canadian initiative 3DPPE GTHA (March-December 2020) were invited to participate in the study. The survey response rate was 54.3%. Of 63 respondents, 39 were patient-facing and 24 were community-facing frontline workers. Participants were asked to rate performance measures in 10 categories on a five-point Likert scale. Data were categorized by organization and frontline worker type, and a t-test was used to determine statistically significant differences among subgroups. Results The mean preference for 3DP face shields among respondents was 3.2 out of 5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1-4.3). Community-facing respondents reported significantly greater overall utility scores for 3DP face shields (3.58, 95% CI: 3.38-3.79) compared to respondents working in a patient-facing profession (2.95, 95% CI: 2.77-3.13;p < 0.05). However, no differences were reported in portability and compatibility with other PPE. Respondents from organizations with large service volumes reported significantly lower overall utility scores (2.67, 95% CI: 2.44-2.89) than respondents in organizations with smaller service volumes (3.45, 95% CI: 3.28-3.62;p < 0.05). Conclusions Community-facing frontline workers and those from smaller service volume organizations endorse higher utility for 3DP face shields than patient-facing frontline workers. Despite this, frontline workers generally rate 3DP face shields positively. 3DP face shields are a viable option for personal and community use and can be used to supplement supply in a community setting.","output":"3D-Printed Personal Protective Face Shields During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Canadian Frontline Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes is considered a risk factor for complications due to COVID-19.

In this retrospective observational study we are evaluating the demographic characteristics, the comorbidities of the patients, the clinical signs of the infection, the signs of clinical severity, the biological assessment at admission, the treatment, the outcomes and the deaths of 133 patients with COVID-19, of which 25 (19,4%) had diabetes. In the compared COVID-19 patients, with and without diabetes, the patients with diabetes were older, had higher blood pressure and more cardio-vascular diseases. Severe forms were more present in diabetic patients (56% versus 27.1%). Weight loss was higher in diabetic patients (6kg versus 3kg). Biologically, diabetic patients had higher levels of C-reactive protein (28 versus 5.8mg/l), procalcitonin (0.28 versus 0,13ng/l), ferritin (501 versus 140ng/ml), lactic dehydrogenase (268 versus 226IU/l) and of D. dimer (665 versus 444g/l). Diabetic patients required more oxygen therapy (60% versus 26.9%), more mechanical ventilation (20% versus 8.3%) and more frequent admission to the intensive care unit (60% versus 27.8%). They presented more thromboembolic complications (12% versus 9%) but there were not significant differences in the other outcomes and in death rates. The excess of morbidity and mortality due to diabetes was still not fully clarified; the role of demographic factors, the interaction of mediations with ACE-2 receptors and the role of co-morbidities will all need to be studied in order to identify the patient at risk profile, i.e. who can develop severe forms of the diseases and more outcomes.

However, the role of platelets in tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis is still unclear. Here we show that patients with active TB have a high number of platelets in peripheral blood and a low number of lymphocytes leading to a high platelets to lymphocytes ratio (PL ratio). Moreover, serum concentration of different mediators promoting platelet differentiation or associated with platelet activation is increased in active TB. Immunohistochemistry analysis shows that platelets localise around the lung granuloma lesions in close contact with T lymphocytes and macrophages. Transcriptomic analysis of caseous tissue of human pulmonary TB granulomas, followed by Gene Ontology analysis, shows that 53 platelet activation-associated genes are highly expressed compared to the normal lung tissue. In vitro activated platelets (or their supernatants) inhibit Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-induced T lymphocyte proliferation and IFN- production. Likewise, platelets inhibit the growth of intracellular macrophages Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis. Soluble factors released by activated platelets mediate both immunological and M. tuberculosis replication activities. Furthermore, proteomic and neutralisation studies (by monoclonal antibody) identify TGF- and PF4 as the factors responsible for inhibiting T-cell response and enhancing the mycobactericidal activity of macrophages, respectively.

Methods: the study was conducted on four different clinical groups (n = 4; total n = 138). Each individual was assigned to different groups based on specific criteria evaluated at the admission such as fever, dyspnea, arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), oral-nasopharyngeal swab/RT-PCR, and thoracic CT-scan. Treatment was performed only after blood samples were collected from each patient (PP and PP) at day 1. The blood samples were analyzed and tested the same day (CBC and Flowcytometry). The positiveCpositive group (PP n = 45; F = 18/ M = 27; median age = 62.33), comprised individuals affected by COVID-19 who showed fever, dyspnea (ABG = pO2 < 60), confirmed positive by oral-nasopharyngeal swab/RT-PCR and with CT-scan showing ground-glass opacities. The negativeCpositive (NP; n = 37; F = 11/M = 26; median age = 75.94) or COVID-like group comprised individuals with fever and dyspnea (ABG = pO2 < 60), who tested negative to nasopharyngeal swab/RT-PCR, with CT-scans showing ground-glass opacities in the lungs. The negativeCaffected group (NA; n = 40; F = 14/M = 26; median age = 58.5) included individuals negative to COVID-19 (RT-PCR) but affected by different chronic respiratory diseases (the CT-scans didnt show ground-glass opacities). Finally, the negativeCnegative group (NN; n = 16; F = 14/M = 2) included healthy patients (NN; n = 16; median age = 42.62). Data and findings were collected and compared.

Methods Retrospective single-center study of all emergency department (ED) patients who had a POC or radiology hip ultrasound or arthrocentesis as part of their ED evaluation for SA in a 3-year period. We investigated the difference in time to obtain hip ultrasonography results and the time to arthrocentesis between radiology and emergency physician-performed studies in cases of suspected septic hip arthritis. Results Seventy-four patients met inclusion criteria. The median time to hip ultrasound completion was 68 (interquartile range [IQR], 38.8-132) minutes in the emergency physician-performed ultrasound group versus 208.5 (IQR, 163.8-301.3) minutes for the radiology group (P < 0.001).

Further studies of ADME-Tox and bioavailability of drugs were also performed that exhibited efficient parameters of drug likeness. Molecular dynamics simulation calculations were performed for the most negative binding affinity of the compound to evaluate the dynamic behavior,and stability of protein-ligand complex. Our findings suggest that these compounds could be potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and endoribonuclease. However, further in-vitro and pre-clinical experiments would validate the potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","output":"In-silico screening of plant-derived antivirals against main protease, 3CLpro and endoribonuclease, NSP15 proteins of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We investigate, by an extensive quality evaluation approach, performances and potential side effects introduced in Computed Tomography (CT) images by Deep Learning (DL) processing. METHOD: We selected two relevant processing steps, denoise and segmentation, implemented by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models based on autoencoder architecture (encoder-decoder and UNet) and trained for the two tasks. In order to limit the number of uncontrolled variables, we designed a phantom containing cylindrical inserts of different sizes, filled with iodinated contrast media. A large CT image dataset was collected at different acquisition settings and two reconstruction algorithms. We characterized the CNNs behavior using metrics from the signal detection theory, radiological and conventional image quality parameters, and finally unconventional radiomic features analysis. RESULTS: The UNet, due to the deeper architecture complexity, outperformed the shallower encoder-decoder in terms of conventional quality parameters and preserved spatial resolution. We also studied how the CNNs modify the noise texture by using radiomic analysis, identifying sensitive and insensitive features to the denoise processing. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed evaluation approach proved effective to accurately analyze and quantify the differences in CNNs behavior, in particular with regard to the alterations introduced in the processed images. Our results suggest that even a deeper and more complex network, which achieves good performances, is not necessarily a better network because it can modify texture features in an unwanted way.","output":"Addressing signal alterations induced in CT images by deep learning processing: A preliminary phantom study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cold spray has recently emerged as a promising new technology for various coating, additive manufacturing, and on-site repair needs. One key challenge underlying cold spray is the proper simulation of the deposition process, for which numerous numerical studies have been carried out, but often fail to consider the interfacial adhesion. In this study, a new numerical approach on the base of peridynamics (PD) was developed to incorporate interfacial interactions as a part of the constitutive model to capture deformation, bonding, and rebound of impacting particles in one unified framework. Two models were proposed to characterize the adhesive contacts, i.e., a long-range Lenard-Johns type potential and a force-stretch relation of the interface directly derived from fracture properties of the bulk material. Using copper as the sample material, the deformation behaviors simulated by the PD-based approach were found to compare well with those from benchmark finite element method simulations. It was further demonstrated that this PD-based approach allows flexibility to realize different deposition scenarios, such as particle-substrate bonding and separation, by modulating adhesion energies. The approach provides a new numerical framework for more realistic cold spray impact simulations.","output":"Peridynamic Simulation of Particles Impact and Interfacial Bonding in Cold Spray Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-standing social inequities and health disparities have resulted in increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, severe illness, and death among racial and ethnic minority populations.

Bibliometrics could be a useful tool for guiding future researches lines and promoting international collaboration for an effective treatment. For this purpose, we have conducted a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on drugs and therapies used to treat COVID-19 during 2020. METHODS: Data source: Web of Science. We gathered data on scientific production relating to drugs used to treat COVID-19. We calculated impact factors and analyzed production by institution, country, and journal, visualizing our results in bibliometric networks. RESULTS: In 1 year, production relating to COVID-19 exceeded 100 000 publications, with over 6,500 on Drugs and COVID-19. Research into hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, tocilizumab and convalescent plasma is particularly noteworthy. Mean citations/study range from 11.9 to 15.4.

Comparative studies have not yet been conducted to investigate the impact of these containment measures; these studies are needed to facilitate public health policy-making across countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the impact of national containment measures and policies (stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns) on decelerating the increase in daily new cases of COVID-19 in 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the pandemic in different jurisdictions worldwide. METHODS: We reviewed the effective dates of the national containment measures (stay-at-home order, curfew, or lockdown) of 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wuhan, New York State, Lombardy, and Madrid), and we searched cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and daily new cases provided by health authorities. Data were drawn from an open, crowdsourced, daily-updated COVID-19 data set provided by Our World in Data. We examined the trends in the percent increase in daily new cases from 7 days before to 30 days after the dates on which containment measures went into effect by continent, World Bank income classification, type of containment measures, effective date of containment measures, and number of confirmed cases on the effective date of the containment measures. RESULTS: We included 122,366 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 54 countries and 24,071 patients from 4 epicenters on the effective dates on which stay-at-home orders, curfews, or lockdowns were implemented between January 23 and April 11, 2020. Stay-at-home, curfew, and lockdown measures commonly commenced in countries with approximately 30%, 20%, or 10% increases in daily new cases. All three measures were found to lower the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within one month. Among the countries studied, 20% had an average percent increase in daily new cases of 30-49 over the seven days prior to the commencement of containment measures; the percent increase in daily new cases in these countries was curbed to 10 and 5 a maximum of 15 days and 23 days after the implementation of containment measures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Different national containment measures were associated with a decrease in daily new cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns curbed the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within a month. Resurgence in cases within one month was observed in some South American countries.","output":"Impact of National Containment Measures on Decelerating the Increase in Daily New Cases of COVID-19 in 54 Countries and 4 Epicenters of the Pandemic: Comparative Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wild poliovirus types 2 and 3 were declared eradicated in 2015 and 2019, respectively, and, since 2017, transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been detected only in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2020, these countries reported their highest number of WPV1 cases since 2014 and experienced outbreaks of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2)* (1); in Afghanistan, the number of WPV1 cases reported increased 93%, from 29 in 2019 to 56 in 2020, with 308 cVDPV2 cases reported. This report describes the activities and progress toward polio eradication in Afghanistan during January 2020-November 2021 and updates previous reports (2-4). Despite restrictions imposed by antigovernment elements since 2018, disruption of polio eradication efforts by the COVID-19 pandemic, and civil and political instability, eradication activities have resumed. During January-November 2021, four WPV1 cases and 43 cVDPV2 cases were detected, representing decreases of 93% from 56 and 85% from 281, respectively, during the same period in 2020. After the assumption of nationwide control by the current de facto government of Afghanistan during August 2021, health officials committed to oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) campaigns nationwide, with the potential to vaccinate approximately 2.5 million children against poliovirus who were previously not accessible for 2 years.

However, little has been reported on in vitro interactions of coinfected viruses. To explore how coinfection of different viruses affects their biological property, we examined growth of influenza A virus (IAV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) during coinfection of Vero cells. We found that IAV growth was enhanced by coinfection with hPIV2. The enhanced growth of IAV was not reproduced by coinfection with an hPIV2 mutant with reduced cell fusion activity, or by ectopic expression of the V protein of hPIV2. In contrast, induction of cell fusion by ectopic expression of the hPIV2 HN and F proteins augments IAV growth. hPIV2 coinfection supported IAV growth in cells originated from the respiratory epithelium. The enhancement correlated closely with cell fusion ability of hPIV2 in those cells. These results indicate that cell fusion induced by hPIV2 infection is beneficial to IAV replication and that enhanced viral replication by coinfection with different viruses can modify their pathological consequences.","output":"Enhanced growth of influenza A virus by coinfection with human parainfluenza virus type 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antibody response magnitude and kinetics may impact clinical severity, serological diagnosis and long-term protection of COVID-19, which may play a role in why children experience lower morbidity.

All twelve cities were adversely affected. The specific time of the impact is related to the pandemic's outbreak and enforced lockdowns policies. Affected by the epidemic, reservation rates decreased, tourists preferred renting in suburbs instead of city centers, the proportion of foreign tourists in all destinations dropped sharply, tourist sentiment scores fluctuated dramatically especially among foreigners, and people focused less on tourism related activities.

The cardiovascular (CV) risk distribution and outcomes, as well as health literacy, are likely to differ from the host population. Challenges related to migrant health status, cardiovascular risk distribution and health literacy are compounded by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) crisis. Methods: We performed a narrative review of available evidence on migrant CV and health literacy in Europe. Results: Health literacy is lower in migrants but can be improved through targeted interventions. In some subgroups of migrants, rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, most importantly hypertension and diabetes, are higher. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for a so-called healthy migrant effect, describing lower rates of CV risk distribution and mortality in a different subset of migrants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CV risk factors, as well as health literacy, are key elements in optimally managing public health responses in the ongoing pandemic. Conclusions: Migrants are both an opportunity and a challenge for public health in Europe. Research aimed at better understanding the healthy migrant effect is necessary. Implementing the beneficial behaviors of migrants could improve outcomes in the whole population. Specific interventions to screen for risk factors, manage chronic disease and increase health literacy could improve health care for migrants.

A consensus regarding an accepted standard to assess the quality of such apps has yet to be reached. A factor that exacerbates the challenge of mHealth app quality assessment is variations in the interpretation of quality and its subdimensions. Consequently, it has become increasingly difficult for health care professionals worldwide to distinguish apps of high quality from those of lower quality. This exposes both patients and health care professionals to unnecessary risks. Despite progress, limited understanding of the contributions of researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) exists on this topic. Furthermore, the applicability of quality assessment methodologies in LMIC settings remains relatively unexplored. OBJECTIVE: This rapid review aims to identify current methodologies in the literature to assess the quality of mHealth apps, understand what aspects of quality these methodologies address, determine what input has been made by authors from LMICs, and examine the applicability of such methodologies in LMICs. METHODS: This review was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews). A search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus was performed for papers related to mHealth app quality assessment methodologies, which were published in English between 2005 and 2020. By taking a rapid review approach, a thematic and descriptive analysis of the papers was performed. RESULTS: Electronic database searches identified 841 papers. After the screening process, 52 papers remained for inclusion. Of the 52 papers, 5 (10%) proposed novel methodologies that could be used to evaluate mHealth apps of diverse medical areas of interest, 8 (15%) proposed methodologies that could be used to assess apps concerned with a specific medical focus, and 39 (75%) used methodologies developed by other published authors to evaluate the quality of various groups of mHealth apps. The authors in 6% (3/52) of papers were solely affiliated to institutes in LMICs. A further 15% (8/52) of papers had at least one coauthor affiliated to an institute in an LMIC. CONCLUSIONS: Quality assessment of mHealth apps is complex in nature and at times subjective. Despite growing research on this topic, to date, an all-encompassing appropriate means for evaluating the quality of mHealth apps does not exist. There has been engagement with authors affiliated to institutes across LMICs; however, limited consideration of current generic methodologies for application in LMIC settings has been identified.

The underlying histopathological processes were unknown at the start of the pandemic. As case reports and series have been published describing the underlying renal histopathology from kidney biopsies, we have started to gain an insight into the renal manifestations of this novel disease. AIM: To provide an overview of the current literature on the renal histopathological features and mechanistic insights described in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: A systematic review was performed by conducting a literature search in the following websites-PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Medline-ProQuest with the following search terms-COVID-19 AND kidney biopsy, COVID-19 AND renal biopsy, SARS-CoV-2 AND kidney biopsy and SARS-CoV-2 AND renal biopsy. We have included published data up until February 15, 2021, which includes kidney biopsies (native, transplant and postmortem) from patients with COVID-19. Data on clinical presentation, histopathological features, management and outcome was extracted from the reported studies. RESULTS: The total number of biopsies reported on here is 288, of which 189 are postmortem, 84 native and 15 transplants. The results are varied and show underlying pathologies ranging from collapsing glomerulopathy and acute tubular injury (ATI) to anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis and pigment nephropathy. There was variation in the specific treatment used for the various renal conditions, which included steroids, hydroxychloroquine, eculizumab, convalescent plasma, rituximab, anakinra, cyclophosphamide and renal replacement therapy, amongst others. The pathological process which occurs in the kidney following COVID-19 infection and leads to the described biopsy findings has been hypothesized in some conditions but not others (for example, sepsis related hypoperfusion for ATI). It is important to note that this represents a very small minority of the total number of cases of COVID-19 related kidney disease, and as such there may be inherent selection bias in the results described. Further work will be required to determine the pathogenetic link, if any, between COVID-19 and the other renal pathologies. CONCLUSION: This report has clinical relevance as certain renal pathologies have specific management, with the implication that kidney biopsy in the setting of renal disease and COVID-19 should be an early consideration, dependent upon the clinical presentation.","output":"Native and transplant kidney histopathological manifestations in association with COVID-19 infection: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: While more advanced COVID-19 necessitates medical interventions and hospitalization, patients with mild COVID-19 do not require this. Identifying patients at risk of progressing to advanced COVID-19 might guide treatment decisions, particularly for better prioritizing patients in need for hospitalization. METHODS: We developed a machine learning-based predictor for deriving a clinical score identifying patients with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 at risk of progressing to advanced COVID-19. Clinical data from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from the multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients (LEOSS) were used for discovery (2020-03-16 to 2020-07-14) and validation (data from 2020-07-15 to 2021-02-16). RESULTS: The LEOSS dataset contains 473 baseline patient parameters measured at the first patient contact. After training the predictor model on a training dataset comprising 1233 patients, 20 of the 473 parameters were selected for the predictor model. From the predictor model, we delineated a composite predictive score (SACOV-19, Score for the prediction of an Advanced stage of COVID-19) with eleven variables. In the validation cohort (n = 2264 patients), we observed good prediction performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73  0.01. Besides temperature, age, body mass index and smoking habit, variables indicating pulmonary involvement (respiration rate, oxygen saturation, dyspnea), inflammation (CRP, LDH, lymphocyte counts), and acute kidney injury at diagnosis were identified. For better interpretability, the predictor was translated into a web interface. CONCLUSION: We present a machine learning-based predictor model and a clinical score for identifying patients at risk of developing advanced COVID-19.

The program included a telemonitoring system whereby abnormal blood pressure, weight and heart rate readings were monitored by a central clinical team, who subsequently referred clinically significant alerts to the patients' usual general practitioner (GP, also known as primary care physician in the United States), HF nurse or cardiologist. While the primary endpoint, 30-day readmissions, was neutral, intervention arm participants demonstrated improvements in readmission rates over 6 months, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) completion and medication compliance. A process evaluation was designed to identify contextual factors and mechanisms that influenced the results, as well as strategies of improving site and participant recruitment and the delivery of the intervention, for a planned larger effectiveness trial of over 1,000 patients across the state of New South Wales, Australia (TCC-Cardiac). METHODS: Multiple data sources were used in this mixed-methods process evaluation, including interviews with four TCC team members, three GPs and three cardiologists. CR completion rates, HF outreach service (HFOS) referrals and cardiologist follow-up appointments were audited. A patient questionnaire was also analysed for evidence of improved self-care as a hypothesised mechanism of the TCC app. An implementation research logic model was used to synthesise our findings. RESULTS: Rates of HFOS referral (83 vs. 72%) and cardiologist follow-up (96 vs. 93%) were similarly high in the intervention and control arms, respectively. Team members were largely positive towards their orientation and training, but highlighted several implementation strategies that could be optimised for TCC-Cardiac: streamlining of the enrolment process, improving the reach of the trial by screening patients in non-cardiac wards, and ensuring team members had adequate time to recruit (>15 h per week). GPs and cardiologists viewed the intervention acceptably regarding potential benefit of closely monitoring, and responding to abnormalities for their patients, though there were concerns of the potential additional workload generated by alerts that did not merit clinical intervention. Clear delineation of which clinician (GP or cardiologist) was primarily responsible for alert management was also recommended, as well as a preference to receive regular summary data. Several patients commented on the mechanisms of improved self-management because of TCC, which could have led to the outcome of improved medication compliance. DISCUSSION: Use of TCC was associated with several benefits, including higher patient engagement and completion rates with CR. The conduct and delivery of TCC-Cardiac will be improved by the findings of this process evaluation to optimise recruitment, and establishing the roles of GPs and cardiologists as part of the model.","output":"Process Evaluation of a Randomised Controlled Trial for TeleClinical Care, a Smartphone-App Based Model of Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Myocarditis and pericarditis have been proposed to account for a proportion of cardiac injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Healthcare providers play a critical role in identifying IPV during pregnancy in ANC clinics. This study explored facilitators and barriers for IPV screening during pregnancy (perinatal IPV screening) by ANC-based healthcare workers in Uganda. METHODS: We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews among twenty-eight purposively selected healthcare providers in one rural and an urban-based ANC health center in Eastern and Central Uganda respectively. Barriers and facilitators to IPV screening during ANC were identified iteratively using inductive-deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants had provided ANC services for a median (IQR) duration of 4.0 (0.1-19) years. Out of 28 healthcare providers, 11 routinely screened women attending ANC clinics for IPV and 10 had received IPV-related training. Barriers to routine IPV screening included limited staffing and space resources, lack of comprehensive gender-based violence (GBV) training and provider unawareness of the extent of IPV during pregnancy. Facilitators were availability of GBV protocols and providers who were aware of IPV (or GBV) tools tended to use them to routinely screen for IPV. Healthcare workers reported the need to establish patient trust and a safe ANC clinic environment for disclosure to occur. ANC clinicians suggested creation of opportunities for triage-level screening and modification of patients' ANC cards used to document women's medical history. Some providers expressed concerns of safety or retaliatory abuse if perpetrating partners were to see reported abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings can inform efforts to strengthen GBV interventions focused on increasing routine perinatal IPV screening by ANC-based clinicians. Implementation of initiatives to increase routine perinatal IPV screening should focus on task sharing, increasing comprehensive IPV training opportunities, including raising awareness of IPV severity, trauma-informed care and building trusting patient-physician relationships.","output":"Facilitators and barriers to routine intimate partner violence screening in antenatal care settings in Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown its destructiveness with more than one million confirmed cases and dozens of thousands of death, which is highly contagious and still spreading globally.

Uganda reported 40,751 cases and 335 deaths as of 9 April 2021 and started its vaccination program among priority groups like health workers, teachers, those with chronic diseases among others in early March 2021. Unanimous uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is required to subsequently avert its spread;therefore, we assessed COVID-19 vaccine acceptability, hesitancy, and associated factors among medical students in Uganda. METHODS: This study employed an online descriptive cross-sectional survey among medical students across 10 medical schools in Uganda. A structured questionnaire via Google Form was conveniently sent to eligible participants via WhatsApp. Each medical school had a coordinator who consistently shared the data tool in the WhatsApp groups. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression were used to assess the association between vaccine acceptability with demographics, COVID-19 risk perception, and vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: We surveyed 600 medical students, 377 (62.8%) were male. COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was 37.3% and vaccine hesitancy 30.7%. Factors associated with vaccine acceptability were being male (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9, p=0.001) and being single (aOR= 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9, p=0.022).

Metabolomic profiling has not been undertaken before in these complex twin pregnancies. Methods: In this prospectively collected case-control study, three cross-cohort comparisons were made between sIUFD MCDA (n = 16), uncomplicated MCDA (n = 16, eight pairs), and uncomplicated singleton pregnancies (n = 8). To identify major sources of variation within the sIUFD MCDA cohort, a secondary comparison was conducted between spontaneous sIUFD (n = 8) and sIUFD in MCDA twins due to selective termination of a single abnormal fetus by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (n = 8). Metabolomics analysis of placental tissue and umbilical cord plasma was performed using LC-MS profiling. The underlying metabolic networks and pathways were analyzed by web-based platforms. Associations and statistical correlations of all identified differential metabolites with neonatal birthweight and birth length were assessed by multivariable linear regression, adjusted for maternal age and gestation. Results: Across four comparisons, 131 and 111 differential metabolites were identified in placental tissue and cord plasma, respectively, with the highest variation seen between the spontaneous vs. single-induced IUFD in MCDA twins by RFA in the cord plasma. Conversely, the number of viable fetuses and the presence of sIUFD in MCDA twins had the highest impact on metabolite variation in placental tissue. Compounds correlated with fetal growth including placental acylcarnitines and gangliosides, along with specific amino acids (e.g., histidinyl-hydroxyproline), xenobiotics and biliverdin in cord plasma.

The utilization of low-cost SSBO to produce value-added diacylglycerol (DAG)-enriched oil and its applications are promising for the sustainability of the oil industry. The objective of this study was to utilize SSBO containing a high content of EE and FFA as raw material to synthesize DAG-enriched oil and to evaluate its nutritional properties in fish. Based on different behaviors between the glycerolysis of EE and the esterification of FFA in one-pot enzymatic catalysis, a two-step vacuum-mediated conversion was developed for the maximum conversions of EE and FFA to DAG. After optimization, the maximum DAG yield (66.76%) and EE and FFA conversions (96 and 93%, respectively) were obtained under the following optimized conditions: lipase loading 3%, temperature 38C, substrate molar ratio (glycerol/FFA and EE) 21:40, a vacuum combination of 566 mmHg within the initial 10 h and 47 mmHg from the 10th to 14th hour. Further nutritional study in fish suggested that the consumption of DAG-enriched oil was safe and served as a functional oil to lower lipid levels in serum and liver, decrease lipid accumulation and increase protein content in body and muscle tissues, and change fatty acid composition in muscle tissues. Overall, these findings were vital for the effective utilization of SSBO resources and the development of future applications for DAG-enriched oil as lipid-lowering functional oil in food.","output":"Enzymatic Synthesis of Diacylglycerol-Enriched Oil by Two-Step Vacuum-Mediated Conversion of Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester and Fatty Acid From Soy Sauce By-Product Oil as Lipid-Lowering Functional Oil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While downstream distribution and demand is likely to be hampered by the labor and income effects of COVID-19, Canada is expected to produce over 88 million tons of grains and oilseeds in 2020.

Validation of caCLEAR on model DNA systems and mouse ESCs supports the suitability of caCLEAR for analysis of 5caCGs. The 5caCG profiles of naive and primed pluripotent ESCs reflect their distinct demethylation dynamics and demonstrate an association of 5caC with gene expression.

METHODS: We used registry data from 1916 consecutive patients undergoing CTD for CTS at a regional hand center between 2010 and 2019. Improvement was defined as change exceeding the respective QuickDASH subscales minimal important change estimate. Predictors included a range of clinical, demographic and patient-reported variables. Data were split into training (75%) and test (25%) sets. A range of machine learning algorithms was developed using the training data and evaluated with the test data.

Although the ameliorating effect of silicon (Si) on plant resistance against fungal pathogens has been proven, the mechanism of its action needs to be better understood on a cellular level. The present study explores the effect of Si application in sorghum roots infected with fungus Alternaria alternata under controlled in vitro conditions. Detailed anatomical and cytological observations by both fluorescent and electron microscopy revealed that Si supplementation results in the inhibition of fungal hyphae growth into the protoplast of root cells. An approach of environmental scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy enabling spatial detection of Si even at low concentrations showed that there is no continual solid layer of silica in the root cell walls of the rhizodermis, mesodermis and exodermis physically blocking the fungal growth into the protoplasts. Additionally, biochemical evidence suggests that Si speeds up the onset of activities of phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidases and polyphenol oxidases involved in phenolic compounds production and deposition to plant cell walls. In conclusion, Si alleviates the negative impact of A. alternata infection by limiting hyphae penetration through sorghum root cell walls into protoplasts, thus maintaining their structural and functional integrity. This might occur by triggering plant biochemical defense responses rather than by creating compact Si layer deposits.","output":"Silicon triggers sorghum root enzyme activities and inhibits the root cell colonization by Alternaria alternata"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hematopoiesis and bone interact in various developmental and pathological processes. Neurogenic heterotopic ossifications (NHO) are the formation of ectopic hematopoietic bones in peri-articular muscles that develop following severe lesions of the central nervous system such as traumatic cerebral or spinal injuries or strokes. This review will focus on the hematopoietic facet of NHO. The characterization of NHO demonstrates the presence of hematopoietic marrow in which quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are maintained by a functional stromal microenvironment, thus documenting that NHOs are neo-formed ectopic HSC niches. Similarly to adult bone marrow, the NHO permissive environment supports HSC maintenance, proliferation and differentiation through bidirectional signaling with mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial cells, involving cell adhesion molecules, membrane-bound growth factors, hormones, and secreted matrix proteins. The participation of the nervous system, macrophages and inflammatory cytokines including oncostatin M and transforming growth factor (TGF)- in this process, reveals how neural circuitry fine-tunes the inflammatory response to generate hematopoietic bones in injured muscles. The localization of NHOs in the peri-articular muscle environment also suggests a role of muscle mesenchymal cells and bone metabolism in development of hematopoiesis in adults. Little is known about the establishment of bone marrow niches and the regulation of HSC cycling during fetal development. Similarities between NHO and development of fetal bones make NHOs an interesting model to study the establishment of bone marrow hematopoiesis during development. Conversely, identification of stage-specific factors that specify HSC developmental state during fetal bone development will give more mechanistic insights into NHO.","output":"Neurogenic Heterotopic Ossifications Recapitulate Hematopoietic Stem Cell Niche Development Within an Adult Osteogenic Muscle Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sialic acids are nine-carbon sugars that frequently cap glycans at the cell surface in cells of vertebrates as well as cells of certain types of invertebrates and bacteria.

OBJECTIVE: This study explored the experiences and perspectives of children in relation to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and related restrictions on everyday life. METHOD: A qualitative study using semistructured online interviews with participatory drawings was undertaken between May and July 2020. Eighteen children from England and Wales, aged 7C11 years, participated in interviews. FINDINGS: Themes included children's reflections on (1) COVID\\\\19 as a deadly contagion; (2) fears and sadness and (3) social responsibility and opportunities to respond positively. CONCLUSIONS: Young children offer insightful reflections on their experiences during the first wave of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Children and young people's perspectives must be considered in future public health discourse.

It is a multifunctional protein expressed mainly by neutrophils and released extracellularly by activated or damaged cells mediating a broad range of physiological and pathological responses. It has been more than 20 years since the implication of S100A8/A9 in the inflammatory process was shown; however, the evaluation of its role in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases or its usefulness as a biomarker for the appropriate diagnosis and prognosis of lung diseases have only gained attention in recent years. This review aimed to provide current knowledge regarding the potential role of CLP in the pathophysiology of lung diseases and describe how this knowledge is, up until now, translated into daily clinical practice. CLP is involved in numerous cellular processes in lung health and disease. In addition to its anti-microbial functions, CLP also serves as a molecule with pro- and anti-tumor properties related to cell survival and growth, angiogenesis, DNA damage response, and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. The findings of this review potentially introduce CLP in daily clinical practice within the spectrum of respiratory diseases.","output":"Calprotectin in Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of hospital admission and mortality from COVID-19 to patients and measure the association of race and area-level social vulnerability with those outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using patient records collected at a multisite hospital system from April 2020 to October 2020, the risk of hospital admission and the risk of mortality were estimated for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, respectively, using generalized estimating equations while controlling for patient race, patient area-level social vulnerability, and time course of the pandemic. RESULTS: Black individuals were 3.57 as likely (95% CI, 3.18C4.00) to be hospitalized than White people, and patients living in the most disadvantaged areas were 2.61 times as likely (95% CI, 2.26C3.02) to be hospitalized than those living in the least disadvantaged areas. While Black patients had lower raw mortality than White patients, mortality was similar after controlling for comorbidities and social vulnerability. DISCUSSION: Our findings point to potent correlates of race and socioeconomic status, including resource distribution, employment, and shared living spaces, that may be associated with inequitable burden of disease across patients of different races.

The design of a hazardous waste management system involves several important decisions, i.e., the determination of the locations and sizes of treatment, recycling and disposal facilities, and organizing the transportation of hazardous waste among different facilities. In this paper, we proposed a novel stochastic bi-objective mixed integer linear program (MILP) to support these decisions in order to reduce the population exposure to risk while simultaneously maintaining a high cost efficiency of the transportation and treatment of hazardous waste. Moreover, considering the inherent uncertainty within the planning horizon, the cost, demand and affected population are defined as stochastic parameters. A sample average approximation based goal programming (SAA-GP) approach is used to solve the mathematical model. The proposed model and solution method are validated through numerical experiments whose results show that uncertainty may not only affect the objective value but also lead to different strategic decisions in the network design of a hazardous waste management system. In this regard, the strategic decisions obtained by the stochastic model is more robust to the change of external environment.

For lung segmentation in computed tomography, a variety of approaches exists, involving sophisticated pipelines trained and validated on different datasets. However, the clinical applicability of these approaches across diseases remains limited. METHODS We compared four generic deep learning approaches trained on various datasets and two readily available lung segmentation algorithms. We performed evaluation on routine imaging data with more than six different disease patterns and three published data sets. RESULTS Using different deep learning approaches, mean Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) on test datasets varied not over 0.02. When trained on a diverse routine dataset (n = 36), a standard approach (U-net) yields a higher DSC (0.97  0.05) compared to training on public datasets such as the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (0.94  0.13, p = 0.024) or Anatomy 3 (0.92  0.15, p = 0.001). Trained on routine data (n = 231) covering multiple diseases, U-net compared to reference methods yields a DSC of 0.98  0.03 versus 0.94  0.12 (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS The accuracy and reliability of lung segmentation algorithms on demanding cases primarily relies on the diversity of the training data, highlighting the importance of data diversity compared to model choice.

We aimed to study the disparities of MIS-C in Mississippi and whether MIS-C follow the same racial distribution as SARS-CoV-2 infection? Methods: Retrospective study of consecutive MIS-C patients <18 years of age hospitalized at our center over 1 year. We compared demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and treatment of MIS-C by race/ethnicity. We compared the distribution of MIS-C cases with that of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Results: During the study period, 51 MIS-C patients hospitalized. Median age was 9 year, 58% male, 36(71%) were AA, 13(25%) were C, 1 was Asian, and 1 was Hispanic. We found a significant delay between onset of symptoms and hospitalization in AA than C children, 2.32.1 vs. 0.61.5 days (P=0.002). Cardiac symptoms were present in 24%, and 39% had Kawasaki's disease-like symptoms. Only absolute neutrophil count was associated with cardiac dysfunction (p= 0.01) on multivariate analysis. Creatinine and ferritin levels were associated with ICU admission;p= 0.01 and 0.03, respectively. Differences in inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers between AA and C races are summarized in Figure 1.

In Tanzania, most chimpanzees (~75%) live outside national parks where human activities threaten their habitats integrity and connectivity. Mahale Mountains National Park (MMNP), therefore, is a critical area for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the region due to its location and protective status. Yet, despite its importance and long history of chimpanzee research (>50 years), a park-wide census of the species has never been conducted. The park is categorized as a savanna-woodland mosaic, interspersed with riparian forest, wooded grassland, and bamboo thicket. This heterogeneous landscape offers an excellent opportunity to assess the ecological characteristics associated with chimpanzee density, a topic still disputed, which could improve conservation plans that protect crucial chimpanzee habitat outside the park. We examined the influence of fine-scale vegetative characteristics and topographical features on chimpanzee nest density, modeling nest counts using hierarchical distance sampling. We counted 335 nests in forest and woodland habitats across 102 transects in 13 survey sites. Nests were disproportionately found more in or near evergreen forests, on steep slopes, and in feeding tree species. We calculated chimpanzee density in MMNP to be 0.23 ind/km(2), although density varied substantially among sites (0.09C3.43 ind/km(2)). Density was associated with factors related to the availability of food and nesting trees, with topographic heterogeneity and the total basal area of feeding tree species identified as significant positive predictors. Species-rich habitats and floristic diversity likely play a principal role in shaping chimpanzee density within a predominately open landscape with low food abundance.

Although high-sensitivity troponin assays introduced a high negative predictive value for AMI, they have exposed the need for diagnostic modalities that can determine the etiology of acute myocardial injury. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is an effective tool to risk stratifying chest pain among patients in the ED. CMR is non-invasive and has a lower cost of care and shorter length of stay compared to those of invasive coronary angiography. It also provides detailed information on cardiac morphology, function, tissue edema, and location and pattern of tissue damage that can help to differentiate many etiologies of cardiac injury. CMR is particularly useful to distinguish chest pain due to type 1 AMI versus supply-demand mismatch due to acute cardiac noncoronary artery disease. A detailed review of the literature has shown that CMR with stress testing is safe to use in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain, with or without abnormal troponins. CMR is a useful, safe, economical, and effective alternative to the traditional diagnostic tools that are typically used in this patient population.

Although extremely useful in many tasks, most models have performed poorly in forecasting the pandemic peaks. We investigate this common pitfall by forecasting four countries' pandemic peak: Austria, Germany, Italy, and South Korea. Far from the peaks, our models can forecast the pandemic dynamics 20 days ahead. Nevertheless, when calibrating our models close to the day of the pandemic peak, all forecasts fail. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis revealed the main obstacle: the misestimation of the transmission rate. Inverse uncertainty quantification has shown that significant changes in transmission rate commonly precede a peak. These changes are a key factor in forecasting the pandemic peak. Long forecasts of the pandemic peak are therefore undermined by the lack of models that can forecast changes in the transmission rate, i.e., how a particular society behaves, changes of mitigation policies, or how society chooses to respond to them. In addition, our studies revealed that even short forecasts of the pandemic peak are challenging. Backward projections have shown us that the correct estimation of any temporal change in the transmission rate is only possible many days ahead. Our results suggest that the distance between a change in the transmission rate and its correct identification in the curve of active infected cases can be as long as 15 days. This is intrinsic to the phenomenon and how it affects epidemic data: a new case is usually only reported after an incubation period followed by a delay associated with the test. In summary, our results suggest the phenomenon itself challenges the task of forecasting the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when only epidemic data is available. Nevertheless, we show that exciting results can be obtained when using the same models to project different scenarios of reduced transmission rates. Therefore, our results highlight that mathematical modeling can help control COVID-19 pandemic by backward projections that characterize the phenomena' essential features and forward projections when different scenarios and strategies can be tested and used for decision-making.","output":"The Quixotic Task of Forecasting Peaks of COVID-19: Rather Focus on Forward and Backward Projections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Change management research has been extensively discussed during the latest decades, and management of information systems constantly investigates the importance of IT as a competitive driving tool.

In this context, telemedicine has become the effective and affordable choice. In this study we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of telephone visits to determine pulmonary exacerbations and hospitalization rates of children with cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. METHODS A total of 119 children with cystic fibrosis or interstitial lung disease were enrolled and provided cases in which telephone visits were applied during the peak time of the coronavirus disease pandemic in our country. The recordings of respiratory, gastrointestinal and other symptoms, nutrition status, rate of acute pulmonary exacerbation, treatments initiated by telephone visits, referral to hospital and hospitalization were established from the electronic health reports of the patients. RESULTS Thirteen patients (10.9%) were symptomatic, 12 of them (10%) were diagnosed with acute pulmonary exacerbation. One patient was diagnosed with peripheral facial paralysis. Nine patients were recalled to the hospital and seven patients (5.8%) were hospitalised. DISCUSSION Using telemedicine the health status of patients can be defined, and patients can be guided on proper healthcare that they need, especially during the times of pandemics which we are facing.

They code for an unusually large number of gene products matching that of small DNA viruses (e.g. DNA bacteriophages). The order of appearance and distribution of enzyme genes along various virus families (e.g. helicase and ExoN) may be seen as an evolutionary marker in these large RNA genomes lying at the genome size boundary. A positive correlation exists between (+)RNA virus genome sizes and the presence of the RNA helicase and the ExoN domains. Although the mechanistic basis of the presence of the helicase is still unclear, the role of the ExoN activity has been linked to the existence of an RNA synthesis proofreading system. In large Nidovirales, ExoN is bound to a processive replicative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and corrects mismatched bases during viral RNA synthesis.

Aim: The aim of the study consisted in the analysis of cytological smears of laryngeal epithelial cells from patients hospitalized at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the 4th Military Teaching Hospital and Polyclinic in Wroclaw in years 2019-2020. The analysis was aimed at demonstrating whether representative laryngeal epithelial material could be obtained from brush biopsies. Material and methods: The study was carried out in 92 subjects aged between 26 and 85 years, including 34 women (37.0%), from whom material for cytological examination had been collected from the larynx in the course of microsurgical procedures carried out using the Kleinsasser laryngeal instrument set in 2019-2020. Results: Analysis was performed on 90 out of 92 cell smears (97.8%). Two smears were not qualified for analysis due to ille-gibility.

Self-sampling methods increase the acceptance of screening. The aim of this study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of clinician sampling versus vaginal and urine self-sampling for HPV diagnosis. Methods: A diagnostic test study was conducted in a rural parish of Cuenca, Ecuador. A total of 120 women participated. Each participant self-collected urine and vaginal samples and underwent clinician sampling for HPV testing. The latter was considered as the golden standard. All three samples were processed with the same amplification and hybridization protocol for HPV detection (Hybribio) following the manufacturers instructions. Results: Characteristics of the participants were: median age 35 years; 40.8% married; 46.7% had a primary level of education; and median age of sexual onset, 17.6 years. The prevalence of any type of HPV with clinician sampling was 15.0%, 17.5% with urine sampling and 18.3% with vaginal self-sampling. Self-sampling sensitivity reached 94.4% (IC 74.2C99.9), and specificity 92.1% (IC 85.2C95.9). Urine sampling had a sensitivity of 88.8% (IC 67.2, 96.9), and specificity 94.1% (IC 67.2C96.9). The negative predictive value was 98.9% (IC 94.2C99.8) for vaginal self-sampling and 97.6% (IC 92.6C99.4) for urine sampling. Conclusions: This study shows that vaginal and urine self-sampling methods have similar sensitivity and specificity compared with clinician sampling for the diagnosis of HPV.

Interval chest radiograph is recommended following community-acquired pneumonia, however its utility in monitoring recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia remains unclear. METHODS: Prospective single-centre observational cohort study. Patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (admission duration 48 h and oxygen requirement 40% or critical care admission) underwent face-to-face assessment 4C6 weeks post-discharge. Primary outcome: radiological resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis (Radiographic Assessment of Lung Oedema score <5). Secondary outcomes: clinical outcomes, symptom questionnaires, mental health screening (Trauma Screening Questionnaire, GAD-7, PHQ-9), physiological testing (4-metre gait speed (4MGS), 1-minute sit-to-stand test (STS)). RESULTS: 119 patients assessed between 3(rd) June and 2(nd) July 2020 at median (IQR) 61 (51C67) days post-discharge. Meansd age 58.714.4 years, body mass index 30.0 (25.9C35.2) kgm(?2), 62% male, 68% ethnic minority. Despite radiographic resolution of pulmonary infiltrates in 87%, mMRC breathlessness scores were above pre-COVID baseline in 46% and patients reported persistent fatigue (68%), sleep disturbance (57%) and breathlessness (32%). Screening thresholds were breached for post-traumatic stress disorder (25%), anxiety (22%) and depression (18%). 4MGS was slow (<0.8 ms(?1)) in 38%, 35% desaturated by 4% during STS. Of 56 thoracic computed tomography scans performed, 75% demonstrated COVID-related interstitial and/or airways disease. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent symptoms, adverse mental health outcomes and physiological impairment are common 2 months after severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Follow-up chest radiograph is a poor marker of recovery, therefore holistic face-to-face assessment is recommended to facilitate early recognition and management of post-COVID sequelae.","output":"Chest radiography is a poor predictor of respiratory symptoms and functional impairment in survivors of severe COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody cocktails represent a promising approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 escape. The determinants for selecting antibody combinations and the mechanism that antibody cocktails prevent viral escape remain unclear. We compared the critical residues in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) used by multiple neutralizing antibodies and cocktails and identified a combination of two antibodies CoV2-06 and CoV2-14 for preventing viral escape. The two antibodies simultaneously bind to non-overlapping epitopes and independently compete for receptor binding. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly escapes from individual antibodies by generating resistant mutations in vitro, but it doesnt escape from the cocktail due to stronger mutational constraints on RBD-ACE2 interaction and RBD protein folding requirements. We also identified a conserved neutralizing epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV for antibody CoV2-12. Treatments with CoV2-06 and CoV2-14 individually and in combination confer protection in mice.

Data from Korea, China and the US have suggested that patients can remain PCR positive up to 3 months without the risk of transmission. The United States CDC has also changed its guidelines to a symptom-based instead of test-based strategy. This strategy could cause some unease among healthcare workers, especially while providing care to patients with re-positive test results. To assess the risk of transmission from a re-positive patient, we conducted a survey of healthcare workers who had come in direct contact with such a patient after airborne isolation was discontinued. Methods We identified one symptomatic patient with confirmed COVID-19 by PCR, who was removed from isolation after testing negative three times by hospital day 47. The patient then tested positive again on hospital day 60. Between day 47 and 60, 75 healthcare workers had direct contact with the patient. A survey screening for COVID-19 symptoms was sent out to each identified individual. To account for incubation, the screening period started on first day of patient contact to two weeks after the last day of patient contact. Respondents who had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to patient contact were excluded in the analysis. Results Out of 75 identified healthcare workers, a total of 47 responded. Two respondents were excluded for testing positive prior to patient contact. 39 out of 45 individuals reported no symptoms. Six individuals reported some symptoms, two of whom subsequently sought testing and reported negative results. The other four did not seek COVID-19 testing. Additionally, four asymptomatic respondents reported testing negative for COVID-19 after contact with the patient. Conclusions The results suggest that after providing care for a patient with re-positive COVID-19 test not in isolation, most of the health care providers remained asymptomatic and none tested positive for COVID-19.

Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination. While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, anaphylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactions that are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications. The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem from activation of mast cells via Fc? receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against COVID-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include: The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal. Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ the event study methodology with the market model on a sample of 90 events (announcement and ex-date). Findings: The authors find that all the corporate announcements do not impact the stock returns in a similar pattern. While the bonus announcement, ex-bonus and ex-split events led to positive significant abnormal returns on the event date, the rights issue and stock-split announcements failed to influence the stock returns. The findings suggest that before making such announcements, the corporates should wait until the market recovers because even the positively impacting events result in negative market responses during pandemic stress. Practical implications: This study will guide the policymakers to stimulate share prices during such pandemics with the help of various corporate announcements. The investors will be assisted in understanding the stock market mechanism and making wise decisions before reacting to corporate actions during a pandemic or emergency period. While the policymakers are concerned with influencing the share prices, the investors are concerned with the composition of the risk-return parameters in their portfolio. This study will act as an essential investment tool for both.

There is a race to develop suitable drugs and vaccines for the disease. The anti-HIV protease drugs are currently repurposed for the potential treatment of COVID-19. The drugs were primarily screened against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. With an urgent need for safe and effective drugs to treat the virus, we have explored natural products isolated from edible and medicinal mushrooms that have been reported to possess anti-HIV protease. Experimental procedures: We have examined 36 compounds for their potential to be SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors using molecular docking study. Moreover, drug-likeness properties including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity were evaluated by in silico ADMET analysis. Results: Our AutoDock study showed that 25 of 36 candidate compounds have the potential to inhibit the main viral protease based on their binding affinity against the enzyme's active site when compared to the standard drugs. Interestingly, ADMET analysis and toxicity prediction revealed that 6 out of 25 compounds are the best drug-like property candidates, including colossolactone VIII, colossolactone E, colossolactone G, ergosterol, heliantriol F and velutin. Conclusion: Our study highlights the potential of existing mushroom-derived natural compounds for further investigation and possibly can be used to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SRLVs cause lifelong infections with chronic inflammatory lesions in various organ systems. Cross-species transmission of SRLV strains in sheep and goats is well documented, but there are few data on the ability of these viruses to infect wild ruminants. The objective of this study was to investigate whether SRLVs circulate among wild small ruminants in Slovenia. During the 2017-2018 hunting season, a total of 38 blood samples were collected from free-ranging chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and European mouflon (Ovis ammon musimon). The serum samples were tested for antibodies against SRLV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The serological tests revealed that of all tested mouflons, 1 animal (11.1%) was seropositive, while all samples from chamois were negative. Based on the results of this study and considering the results of previous studies in which SRLV infections were detected in mouflons with low seroprevalence, it is very likely that the detected seropositive animal was an incidental spillover host for SRLV. Although no seropositive samples were found in chamois, we cannot speculate on whether chamois may not be a host for SRLV infection because of the small sample size and the disadvantages of the ELISA assay used when applied to samples from chamois.","output":"Serological Survey of Small Ruminant Lentivirus Infections in Free-Ranging Mouflon and Chamois in Slovenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented COVID-19 epidemic spread quickly across nations and country after country counter with lockdowns, making about 1.5 billion students remain at home worldwide.

This presentation will highlight challenges and lessons learned from two pilot studies with Vietnamese-, Cambodian-, and Korean-American family caregivers aged 50 and older. The first study (n=9) implemented a one-on-one, telephone-based psychosocial intervention before the COVID-19 pandemic; the second is an ongoing study (n=12) consisting of a group-based intervention via Zoom. Throughout recruitment, the following challenges arose: addressing the lack of familiarity with research among caregivers, earning the trust of caregivers, and identifying creative ways to recruit caregivers to participate. During study implementation, common challenges included: caregivers unpredictable daily schedule that made it difficult to participate in the scheduled classes, caregivers feeling apprehensive about technology and Zoom, access to reliable internet, and facilitating participation and engaging the voices of caregivers over the phone or via Zoom. Strategies were identified to address these barriers: engaging the support and collaboration of trusted, bilingual and bicultural community-based providers, building culturally-responsive rapport with caregivers, and seeking continuous feedback from caregivers to improve the appeal of the project implementation. The COVID-19 pandemic added an additional layer of difficulty to the research, requiring creativity and flexibility in implementation that took into consideration caregivers heightened anxiety, distress, lack of participation due to around-the-clock care, and loss and grief.

The aim was to evaluate noninferiority of air-polishing compared to sonic scaling in deeper periodontal pockets with respect to pocket depth (PD). METHODS: In 44 participants, 2 single-rooted teeth [(PD)  5 mm] were treated using a split-mouth design. While a new air polishing device with a conical shaped tip was used for the experimental group, sonic scaling was performed in the control group. PD, clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded at baseline, (T0) after 3 months (T1) and 6 months (T2). Pain perception was rated using a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 = no pain, 100 = maximum pain). RESULTS: PD and CAL decreased significantly for both groups, while no intergroup differences were found (PD [mean, mm] control T0 5.96, T2 4.75; experimental T0 5.96, T2 4.8; intergroup p = 0.998; CAL [mean, mm] control T0 7.38, T2 5.84; experimental T0 7.28, T2 6.34; intergroup p = 0.368). For BOP, no intergroup differences were found from T0 to T2 (reduction control 42.5%; experimental 46.5% p = 0.398). Pain perception was significantly lower for air polishing (VAS [mean, mm] control 28.8, experimental 12.56; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: None of the two treatment procedures showed inferior clinical effects with regard to PD, CAL and BOP with air polishing being more comfortable to patients.

As a part of its efforts to control TB, the World Health Organisation (WHO) adopted the End TB Strategy in 2014 to reduce TB incidence by 90% between 2015 and 2035, with intermediate targets every five years. We examined TB incidence data from 2000 to 2018 for 40 high burden countries (HBCs) from the WHO published statistics, contextualized and assessed trends over time, and projected incidence to 2035 for each country. Two recurrent patterns accounted for 26 of the 40 HBCs: linear decrease (n = 14) or a peak in the 2000s followed by decline (n = 12). As uncontrolled HIV is the greatest risk factor for TB, we assessed trends in TB in HIV infected people and TB in HIV uninfected people separately in 15 Sub-Saharan African countries with high HIV prevalence. The projections of current trends were compared against the reductions required to meet the WHO End TB targets. Of the 25 countries without a high burden of TB, only 5 are on track to meet the End TB targets: Ethiopia, Laos, Myanmar, Russia, and South Korea. Of the 15 high HIV burden countries, 6 are on track to meet the End TB targets: Eswatini, Kenya, Lesotho, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Overall, we predict 62 million excess cases of TB between 2020 and 2035 in the 29 HBCs projected to miss the WHO End TB targets. In high HIV burden countries, new programs aimed directly at TB will be required to maintain momentum. Moreover, our projections are based on data prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; the disruption of the pandemic is overwhelmingly likely to interrupt vital TB services and increase TB incidence. We anticipate that these findings will help orientate countries to their progress towards the End TB goals and inform the level of investment required to meet these important targets for a TB-free world.","output":"An Evaluation of the 2035 WHO End TB Targets in 40 High Burden Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy is an intracellular process that targets intracellular pathogens for lysosomal degradation. Autophagy is tightly controlled at transcriptional and post-translational levels.

Several NRs show promise as host-directed anti-infectives through the modulation of autophagy activities by their natural ligands or small molecules (agonists/antagonists). Here, we review the roles and mechanisms of NRs (vitamin D receptors, estrogen receptors, estrogen-related receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) in linking immunity and autophagy during infection. We also discuss the potential of emerging NRs (REV-ERBs, retinoic acid receptors, retinoic acid-related orphan receptors, liver X receptors, farnesoid X receptors, and thyroid hormone receptors) as candidate antimicrobials.

Antigenically similar to their virulent counterparts are FCoV biotypes designated feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which usually cause only mild enteritis and are unable to efficiently infect macrophages and monocytes. The FCoV spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell and has previously been shown to determine the distinct tropism exhibited by certain isolates of FIPV and FECV, however the molecular mechanism underlying viral pathogenesis has yet to be determined. Here we show that the FECV strain WSU 79-1683 (FECV-1683) is highly dependent on host cell cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity for entry into the host cell, as well as on the low pH of endocytic compartments. In addition, both cathepsin B and cathepsin L are able to induce a specific cleavage event in the FECV-1683 spike protein. In contrast, host cell entry by the FIPV strains WSU 79-1146 (FIPV-1146) and FIPV-DF2 proceeds independently of cathepsin L activity and low pH, but is still highly dependent on cathepsin B activity. In the case of FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2, infection of primary feline monocytes was also dependent on host cell cathepsin B activity, indicating that host cell cathepsins may play a role in the distinct tropisms displayed by different feline coronavirus biotypes.","output":"Differential role for low pH and cathepsin-mediated cleavage of the viral spike protein during entry of serotype II feline coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study models local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus in China between January 19 and February 29, 2020.

We explored the impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities on capability well-being, mental health and social support in Austria. METHODS: Adult Austrian residents (n = 560) provided responses to a cross-sectional online survey about their experiences during Covid-19 lockdown (15 March-15 April 2020). Instruments measuring capabilities (OxCAP-MH), depression and anxiety (HADS), social support (MSPSS) and mental well-being (WHO-5) were used in association with six pre-defined vulnerabilities using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: 31% of the participants reported low mental well-being and only 30% of those with a history of mental health treatment received treatment during lockdown. Past mental health treatment had a significant negative effect across all outcome measures with an associated capability well-being score reduction of - 6.54 (95%CI, - 9.26, - 3.82). Direct Covid-19 experience and being 'at risk' due to age and/or physical health conditions were also associated with significant capability deprivations. When adjusted for vulnerabilities, significant capability reductions were observed in association with increased levels of depression (- 1.77) and anxiety (- 1.50), and significantly higher capability levels (+ 3.75) were associated with higher levels of social support. Compared to the cohort average, individual capability impacts varied between - 9% for those reporting past mental health treatment and + 5% for those reporting one score higher on the social support scale. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to assess the capability limiting aspects of lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities alongside their impacts on mental health and social support. The negative capability well-being, mental health and social support impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown were strongest for people with a history of mental health treatment.

Aging clock models were applied to the subjects with different COVID-19 conditions in the UK-Biobank cohort. We performed a bivariate genomic scan for age-related COVID-19 and Mendelian Randomization analysis of 389 immune cell traits to investigate their effect on lifespan and COVID-19 risk. RESULTS: We show that the genetic variation that supports longer life is significantly associated with the lower risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. The odds ratio is 0.31 (P = 9.7  10(?6)) and 0.46 (P = 3.3  10(?4)), respectively, per additional 10 years of life.

Genetic profiling of age-related COVID-19 infection indicates key contributions of Notch signaling and immune system development. We reveal a negative correlation between the effects of immune cell traits on lifespan and COVID-19 risk. We find that lower B-cell CD19 levels are indicative of an increased risk of COVID-19 and decreased life expectancy, which is further validated by COVID-19 clinical data.

However, its application on colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly understood. We herein identified potential antigens for designing an effective mRNA vaccine, further to build an immune landscape for the accurate selection of patients for mRNA vaccine therapy. Raw transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were retrieved. Consensus clustering algorithm was applied to divide the CRC samples into four immune subtypes. Immunogenomics analysis was further integrated to characterize the immune microenvironment of each immune subtype. Six tumor antigens were found to be associated with poor prognosis and infiltration of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in CRC patients. Furthermore, each of the immune subtypes showed differential cellular and molecular features. The IS2 and IS4 exhibited significantly improved survival and higher immune cell infiltration compared with IS1 and IS3. Immune checkpoint molecules and human leukocyte antigen also showed significant differential expression in four immune subtypes. Moreover, we performed graph structure learning-based dimensionality reduction to visualize the immune landscape of CRC. Our results revealed a complex immune landscape that may provide directions for mRNA vaccine treatment of CRC and define appropriate vaccination patients.","output":"Identification of Tumor Antigens and Design of mRNA Vaccine for Colorectal Cancer Based on the Immune Subtype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among COVID-19 hospitalized patients, high incidence of alterations in inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers correlates with a poor prognosis. Comorbidities such as chronic degenerative diseases are frequently associated with complications in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate inflammatory and procoagulant biomarkers in COVID-19 patients from a public hospital in Mexico. Blood was sampled within the first 48 h after admission in 119 confirmed COVID-19 patients that were classified in 3 groups according to oxygen demand, evolution and the severity of the disease as follows: 1) Non severe: nasal cannula or oxygen mask; 2) Severe: high flow nasal cannula and 3) Death: mechanical ventilation eventually leading to fatal outcome. Blood samples from 20 healthy donors were included as a Control Group. Analysis of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers including D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, PAI-1, P-selectin and VWF was performed in plasma. Routine laboratory and clinical biomarkers were also included and compared among groups. Concentrations of D-dimer (14.5  13.8 g/ml) and PAI-1 (1223  889.6 ng/ml) were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients (P < 0.0001). A significant difference was found in interleukin-6, PAI-1 and P-selectin in non-severe and healthy donors when compared to Severe COVID-19 and deceased patients (P < 0.001). VWF levels were also significantly different between severe patients (153.5  24.3 UI/dl) and non-severe ones (133.9  20.2 UI/dl) (P < 0.0001).

METHODS Transcripts encoding TLRs were assayed by quantitative real time RT-PCR on peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with HIV-1 infection who were responding or not responding to antiretroviral therapy and healthy control subjects. RESULTS Chronic HIV-1-infected patients who failed to respond to therapy showed reduced expression of TLRs 3, 4 and 9, together with increased expression of TLR7, as compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, a trend towards a higher expression of TLR3 and TLR9 was observed in responder patients compared with non-responders. In addition, we found lower levels of TRLs 3, 7 and 9 in patients with high levels of HIV-1 RNA compared to those with lower levels of viremia.

We conducted in vitro and in vivo studies to examine this hypothesis. The results showed that 10(C3) M MT potentiated the inhibitory effect of HX on mouse oocyte meiosis by lowering the rate of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and the first polar body (PB1). However, 10(C5) M and 10(C7) M MT significantly alleviated the nuclear suppression induced by HX and restored meiosis in 3- and 6-week-old mouse oocytes, respectively. We identified that the rate-limiting melatonin synthetic enzyme AANAT and melatonin membrane receptor MT1 were both expressed in oocytes and cumulus cells at the GV and MII stages. Luzindole, a non-selective melatonin membrane receptor antagonist, blocked the activity of MT on oocyte meiotic recovery (P < 0.05). This observation indicated that the activity of melatonin was mediated by the MT1 receptor. To understand the molecular mechanism further, MT1 knockout (KO) mice were constructed. In this MT1 KO animal model, the PB1 rate was significantly reduced with the excessive expression of cAPM synthases (Adcy2, Adcy6, Adcy7, and Adcy9) in the ovaries of these animals. The mRNA levels of Nppc and Npr2 were upregulated while the genes related to progesterone synthesis (Cyp11a11), cholesterol biosynthesis (Insig1), and feedback (Lhcgr, Prlr, and Atg7) were downregulated in the granulosa cells of MT1 KO mice (P < 0.05). The altered gene expression may be attributed to the suppression of oocyte maturation. In summary, melatonin protects against nuclear inhibition caused by HX and restores oocyte meiosis via MT1 by reducing the intracellular concentration of cAMP.","output":"Melatonin Alleviates the

Yet children and youth also have the capacity to be resilient and act as powerful catalysts for change in their own lives and wider communities following disaster. Specific factors that contribute to resilience in children and youth, however, remain relatively unexplored. This article examines factors associated with high levels of resilience in 100 children and youth aged 5- to 18-years old who experienced the 2016 Fort McMurray, Alberta wildfire. A mixed-methods design was employed combining quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data was obtained from the Children and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28) which measured individual, caregiver, and context factors influencing resilience processes among the participants. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews to gain further insight into the disaster experiences of children and youth. Quantitative findings reveal higher than average levels of resilience among the participants compared to normative scores. Qualitative findings suggest high levels of resilience were associated with both caregiver factors (specifically physical caregiving), and individual factors (primarily peer support). We discuss how physical caregiving and peer support during and after the wildfire helped mitigate the negative effects of disaster, thus bolstering children and youth's resilience. Implications for understanding the specific social-ecological factors that facilitate and support resiliency processes and overall recovery of children and youth following disaster are also discussed.","output":"Social-Ecological Factors Associated With Higher Levels of Resilience in Children and Youth After Disaster: The Importance of Caregiver and Peer Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we develop a model to examine the dynamics of the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) processes in the aftermath of Covid-19.

As most healthcare workers are passionate nursing professionals, frustration and often a sense of powerlessness occur when they find themselves unable to provide needed care to their patients. The overwhelming number of deaths, patients isolated and dying alone, and the ever-present fear of being infected and then infecting colleagues, family, friends due to the lack of protective gear or known protocols takes its toll on emotional and psychological well-being.

To inform the safe re-opening of Victorian schools and early childhood education and care (ECEC) in late 2020, a detailed analysis of local data was undertaken. METHODS: Data on all Victorian SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases, their close contacts, and ECEC/school events from the first case in Victoria to the end of the third school term (25/01/2020 C 18/09/2020) were analysed. We compared temporal and geographic trends in cases linked to ECEC/school events and community cases; and describe events with onward transmission by age of first case, and public health actions. FINDINGS: Victoria recorded 20,049 SARS-CoV-2 cases during the study period. In total, 1,691 cases and 18,423 contacts were linked to 339 events in ECEC/schools. Many (n=224, 661%) events had no evidence of onward transmission, and most (965%) involved <10 cases. Onward transmission was more common when the first case was older: when first case was aged 0-5 years, 141% events involved additional cases, compared to 305% (6-12 years), 333% (13-15 years), 429% (16-18 years), and 391% when the first case was an adult. ECEC/schools were closed within a median of one day (IQR 0-2) from laboratory notification of the first case. INTERPRETATION: Mitigation measures and rapid responses prevented most SARS-CoV-2 cases in ECEC/schools from becoming outbreaks in Victoria in 2020. As new variants emerge and vaccination coverage increases, ECEC/school mitigation strategies should be tailored to local community transmission and educational level.

METHOD Four fresh human cadaveric workshops conducted in Oxford, UK, in 2015 and two in Chicago, USA, in 2013-2014, trained a total of 52 surgeons. Parameters of operative performance for each delegate were recorded. Previous surgical experience and uptake of taTME in the surgeons' clinical setting were surveyed. RESULTS Forty-seven taTME cases were performed on cadaveric models. Participating surgeons had previous experience in laparoscopic TME surgery and transanal approaches but limited taTME exposure. The purse-string remained occluded throughout in 93% of UK and 60% of US cases. Operative timings for key procedural steps were similar between the two countries with a mean time from start of circumferential dissection to peritoneal entry of 79.5 min (range 25-155). 96% of surgeons dissected transanally to a level S2 or above. The TME specimen quality was complete or near complete in 81%, with improvements noted between the first and second procedure performed. 81% of surgeons surveyed are currently performing taTME in their local hospitals. CONCLUSION Fresh-frozen cadavers provide excellent teaching models for complex pelvic surgery. A structured training curriculum including reading material, dry-lab purse-string practice and postcourse mentorship will provide surgeons with a more complete training package and ongoing support, to ultimately ensure the safe introduction of taTME in the clinical setting.","output":"Developing and assessing a cadaveric training model for transanal total mesorectal excision: initial experience in the UK and USA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing lethal acute respiratory disease emerged in December 2019. The World Health Organization named this disease COVID-19 and declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Many studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their exosomes (MSCs-Exo), which are isolated from allogenic bone marrow stem cells, significantly lower the risk of alveolar inflammation and other pathological conditions associated with distinct lung injuries. For example, in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia patients, MSCs-Exo and MSCs provide similar healing properties and some clinical trials have used cell-based inhalation therapy which show great promise. MSCs and MSCs-Exo have shown potential in clinical trials as a therapeutic tool for severely affected COVID-19 patients when compared to other cell-based therapies, which may face challenges like the cells' sticking to the respiratory tract epithelia during administration. However, the use of MSCs or MSCs-Exo for treating COVID-19 should strictly adhere to the appropriate manufacturing practices, quality control measurements, preclinical safety and efficacy data, and the proper ethical regulations.

In this study, 176 patients with type 2 diabetes were selected as the research objects, and they were divided into different groups based on gender, course of disease, age, glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c), 2 h C peptide (2 h C-P) after meal, fasting C peptide (FC-P), and complications. The research objects were performed with HRCT scan, and the Faster-RCNN algorithm model was built to obtain the imaging features. The relationships between HRCT imaging features and 2 h C-P, FC-P, HbA1c, gender, course of disease, age, and complications were analyzed comprehensively. The results showed that there were no significant differences in HRCT scores between male and female patients, patients of various ages, and patients with different HbA1c contents (P > 0.05). As the course of disease and complications increased, HRCT scores of patients increased obviously (P < 0.05). The HRCT score decreased dramatically with the increase in the contents of 2 h C-P and FC-P after the meal (P < 0.05). In addition, the results of the Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that the course of disease and complications were positively correlated with the HRCT scores, while the 2 h C-P and FC-P levels after meal were negatively correlated with the HRCT scores. The receiver operating curve (ROC) showed that the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of HRCT imaging based on Faster-RCNN algorithm were 90.12%, 90.43%, and 83.64%, respectively, in diagnosing lung infection of patients with type 2 diabetes. In summary, the HRCT imaging features based on the Faster-RCNN algorithm can provide effective reference information for the diagnosis and condition assessment of lung infection in patients with type 2 diabetes.","output":"High-Resolution Computer Tomography Image Features of Lungs for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes under the Faster-Region Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory symptoms are the most common presentation of an acute COVID-19 infection, but thromboembolic phenomena, encephalopathy and other neurological symptoms have been reported.

Chest CT has been found to play an important role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. However, quantitatively assessing temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia over time using CT has still not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to perform a longitudinal study to quantitatively assess temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This retrospective and multi-center study included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 16 hospitals between January 19 and March 27, 2020. Mass was used as an approach to quantitatively measure dynamic changes of pulmonary involvement in patients with COVID-19. Artificial intelligence (AI) was employed as image segmentation and analysis tool for calculating the mass of pulmonary involvement. Results A total of 581 confirmed patients with 1,309 chest CT examinations were included in this study. The median age was 46 years (IQR, 35-55; range, 4-87 years), and 311 (53.5%) patients were male. The mass of pulmonary involvement peaked on day 10 after the onset of initial symptoms. Furthermore, the mass of pulmonary involvement of older patients (>45 years) was significantly severer (P<0.001) and peaked later (day 11 vs. day 8) than that of younger patients (45 years). In addition, there were no significant differences in the peak time (day 10 vs. day 10) and median mass (P=0.679) of pulmonary involvement between male and female. Conclusions Pulmonary involvement peaked on day 10 after the onset of initial symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Further, pulmonary involvement of older patients was severer and peaked later than that of younger patients.

We asked questions about alcohol consumption, smoking plus history and frequency of sports-betting. RESULTS: We enrolled 401 riders. The median age was 29.0 years, interquartile range 25C32 years. Seventy four (18.5%) had engaged in sports-betting in the past 30 days. Among those that reported sports-betting, 16(21.6%) engaged daily or almost daily.

METHODS: The Coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2 and Diabetes Outcomes (CORONADO) study was a nationwide observational study aiming to describe the phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of T2DM patients with COVID-19 admitted to 68 French hospitals between 10 March and 10 April 2020. The composite primary outcome comprised tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 and 28 days of admission. The association between statin use and outcomes was estimated by logistic regression analysis after applying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using a propensity score-weighting approach. RESULTS: Of the 2449 patients with T2DM (881 women, 1568 men; aged 70.9  12.5 years) suitable for analysis, 1192 (49%) were using statin treatment before admission.

We examined changes in rates of pedestrian injuries resulting from collisions with pedal cycles and motor vehicles in England during 2005C2015, a period of increased cycling activity, and described the gender, age distribution and locations of pedestrians injured in collisions with pedal cycles and motor vehicles. METHODS: Collisions data were obtained from police STATS19 datasets. We used two measures of cycle/motor vehicle use; miles per annum, and estimated average travel time, and assessed evidence for trends towards increase over time using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 3414 pedestrians injured in collisions with one or more pedal cycles in England during 2005C2015, 763 of whom were killed or seriously injured (KSI). This accounted for 1.3% of the total pedestrians KSI from all vehicles. Of those KSI in collisions with cycles, 62% were female; 42% over the age of 60; 26% were on the footway or verge and 24% were on a pedestrian crossing. There was a 6% (IRR 1.056; 95% CI 1.032C1.080, p < 0.001) annual increase in the pedestrian KSI rate per billion vehicle miles cycled in England over the time span. This increase was disproportionate to the increase in cycle use measured by vehicle miles or time spent cycling. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in cycling were associated with disproportionate increases in pedestrian injuries in collisions with pedal cycles in England, although these collisions remain a very small proportion of all road injury. Increased active travel is essential for meeting a range of public health goals, but needs to be planned for with consideration for potential impact on pedestrians, particularly older citizens.","output":"Pedestrian injuries in collisions with pedal cycles in the context of increased active travel: Trends in England, 2005C2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Backgroud: Studies of risk factors for prognosis of COVID-19 have increased rapidly, but researches about the association between albumin (ALB) levels and COVID-19 clinical outcomes are limited.

Conclusion: The diagnosis of invasive fungal infections is very difficult, mNGS can make an accurate pathogenic diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases for the clinic and provide a basis for clinical treatment.","output":"Pneumonia caused by Lichtheimia ramosa during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei Province, ChinamNGS assists diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cambodia has made impressive progress in reducing malaria trends and, in 2018, reported no malaria related deaths for the first time. However, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a potential challenge to the countrys goal for malaria elimination by 2025. The path towards malaria elimination is dependent on sustained interventions to prevent rapid resurgence, which can quickly set back any gains achieved. Malaria Consortium supported Mobile Malaria Workers (MMWs) engage with target communities to promote acceptance, trust, and resilience. During the COVID-19 pandemic Malaria Consortiums policy has been to follow national guidelines while continuing to support community-based malaria services via the MMWs / mobile malaria posts (MPs) with as minimal disruption as possible. A COVID-19 risk assessment was carried out by Malaria Consortium, with a mitigation plan quickly developed and implemented, to ensure MMWs were able to continue providing services without putting themselves or their patients at risk.In general, Health Centres and village malaria workers at District level saw an overall decline in malaria testing in March and April;however, Malaria Consortium-supported MMWs did not report any such decline in the utilization of their services. They attribute this to the trust they have among the communities especially regarding Covid-19 mitigation measures that were implemented, and their consequent ability to continue working safely thanks to Malaria Consortiums rapid response and continued support.By effectively demonstrating care and solidarity with and among the MMWs and communities being served, the rapid and effective Covid-19 mitigation measures and community messaging have ensured a high level of trust, and therefore willingness to continue providing and utilising malaria services as usual, despite the fear of COVID-19. By building trust among rural communities, resilience was strengthened, and effective malaria elimination activities were able to continue uninterrupted, even during an extraneous disruptive force such as the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"The importance of building community trust for sustained health interventions during disruptive events such as COVID-19: A Cambodia case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experimenters face challenges and limitations while analyzing glycoproteins due to their high flexibility, stereochemistry, anisotropic effects, and hydration phenomena.

A more in-depth multifaceted picture of the Lewy body dementia lived experience will enable identification of best practice and future research direction. The review aim was to explore experiences of people living with Lewy body dementia and their family carers. DESIGN Integrative review method informed by Whittemore and Knafl, supported by the information retrieval framework PALETTE. A convergent integrated approach enabled synthesis of key findings and theme identification. DATA SOURCES Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, and ALOIS databases were systematically searched to find studies published between 1995 and 2020. REVIEW METHODS Twenty-six articles from twenty studies were synthesized (from 1583 retrieved). Quality and relevance were appraised using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool and Gough's 'Weight of Evidence' framework. Data management was supported by ATLAS.ti 8 and COVIDENCE software. RESULTS Four themes were identified: living with an uncertain diagnosis and prognosis; fear of the now - worry for the future; living with behavioural and psychiatric symptoms; and maintaining a social and emotional life. People reported difficulty finding information and support around diagnosis, disease progression and managing complex symptoms. The result is increased caregiver burden, grief and stress and reduced quality of life. CONCLUSION Delayed diagnosis and complex symptom burden means people are not getting the timely support and information they need to live and die well. Current evidence is largely quantitative, with a focus on family caregiver burden and unmet need. The challenge remains in how to capture a more holistic picture of the lived experience for people living with Lewy body dementia and those who care for them.

The general morphology of the columella shows considerable variation across species, yet few studies have attempted to provide quantitative comparisons, and basic anatomical data has not been thoroughly reported. In this study, we examined the middle ear in 49 taxonomically diverse species of bird. We found significant correlations between measurements of several features (columellar length, mass, tympanic membrane area, footplate area) and interaural diameter. While scaling of columellar length with interaural diameter is consistent with isometry, masses and areas showed negative allometry, or a non-proportional scaling with interaural diameter. These observations remained true even for species with unusual middle ear morphology, such as Alcedinidae (Kingfishers) in which the basal struts of the columella form a structure almost resembling a mammalian stapes, or Tytonidae (Barn Owls) which have a highly bulbous footplate.

Cases no. 1 and 4 were unrelated and the remaining two cases, no. 2 and 3, were reportedly siblings. Histopathological changes were characterized by severely altered dermal collagen fibers. Transmission electron microscopy in one case demonstrated abnormalities in the collagen fibril organization and structure. The genomes of the two unrelated affected cats and one of the affected siblings were sequenced and individually compared to 54 feline control genomes. We searched for private protein changing variants in known human EDS candidate genes and identified three independent heterozygous COL5A1 variants. COL5A1 is a well-characterized candidate gene for classical EDS. It encodes the pro1 chain of type V collagen, which is needed for correct collagen fibril formation and the integrity of the skin. The identified variants in COL5A1 are c.112_118+15del or r.spl?, c.3514A>T or p.(Lys1172*), and c.3066del or p.(Gly1023Valfs*50) for cases no. 1, 2&3, and 4, respectively. They presumably all lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which results in haploinsufficiency of COL5A1 and causes the alterations of the connective tissue. The whole genome sequencing approach used in this study enables a refinement of the diagnosis for the affected cats as classical EDS.

The impact of diet and exercise interventions on brain health is less consistent, especially with dietary interventions which rely on varying approaches. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 6-month intervention combining exercise with a novel dietary counseling approach to improve hippocampal volume among older adults at-risk for dementia. METHODS: Participants with vascular risk factors and subjective cognitive decline or early mild cognitive impairment were cluster randomized in groups of 3C4 to the diet intervention (DIET) or control education (ED) group. All participants engaged in 1 h of supervised exercise per week and additional exercise at home. DIET involved 1 h per week of group-based dietary counseling comprising education, goal setting, and strategy training. ED involved 1 h per week of group-based brain health education classes. Our primary outcome was change in hippocampal volume from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in cognitive function, blood biomarkers, diet, and fitness. Recruitment challenges and early discontinuation of the trial due to COVID-19 necessitated a revised focus on feasibility and preliminary efficacy. RESULTS: Of 190 older adults contacted, 14 (7%) were eligible and enrolled, constituting 21% of our recruitment target. All participants completed the intervention and attended 90% of exercise and DIET/ED sessions on average. All 6-month assessments prior to COVID-19 were completed but disruptions to in-person testing resulted in incomplete data collection. No serious adverse events occurred and all participants expressed positive feedback about the study. Preliminary findings did not identify any significant changes in hippocampal volume; however, substantial improvements in diet and HbA1c were observed with DIET compared to ED (d = 1.75 and 1.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: High adherence and retention rates were observed among participants and preliminary findings illustrate improvements in diet quality and HbA1c. These results indicate that a larger trial is feasible if difficulties surrounding recruitment can be mitigated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03056508.

There has been limited research on the impact of anticoagulant and antiplatelet choice in COVID-19. MethodsThis was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of 933 patients with COVID-19 infection presenting between 01/02/2020 and 31/05/2020. Survival time at 90 days post-diagnosis and thromboembolism development were the measured outcomes. ResultsOf 933 total patients, mean age was 68 years and 54.4% were male. 297 (31.8%) did not survive at 90 days. A Cox proportional hazards model analysis found no statistically significant relationship between anticoagulant or antiplatelet choice and survival (p<0.05). 57 (6.3%) developed thromboembolism. Antiplatelet choice was not shown to have a statistically significant relationship with thromboembolism development. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use did not have a statistically significant impact on thromboembolism development (p<0.05).

RESULTS: During first 3 months of the outbreak, 224/375 (59.7%) residents were classified \\"COVID-19 cases\\" and 57/375 (15.2%) died. Hospital dependent nursing homes had lower COVID-19 case fatality rates in comparison to non-hospital dependent nursing home (15 [6.6%] vs 38 [25.8%], OR 0.20 [0.11-0.38], p = 0.001).

COVID-19-associated myocarditis has been well-described, but the prevalence of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in young athletes after COVID-19 infection is unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the prevalence and extent of cardiovascular involvement in collegiate athletes that had recently recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of collegiate varsity athletes with prior COVID-19 infection, all of whom underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) prior to resumption of competitive sports in August 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-two collegiate athletes with prior COVID-19 infection underwent CMR. The median time from SARS-CoV-2 infection to CMR was 52 days. The mean age was 20.2 years. Athletes represented 8 different varsity sports. This cohort was compared to 22 healthy controls and 22 tactical athlete controls. Most athletes experienced mild illness (N=17, 77%), while the remainder (23%) were asymptomatic. No athletes had abnormal troponin I, electrocardiograms, or LVEF < 50% on echocardiography. Late gadolinium enhancement was found in 9% of collegiate athletes and one athlete (5%) met formal criteria for myocarditis.

Serum exosomes are nanovesicles that have multiple biological functions, playing roles in antigen presentation, intercellular signal communication, inflammatory response and immune surveillance. However, the biological functions and related molecular bases remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the profiles of cytokines/chemokines harbored in the exosomes of septic mice and explored the mechanisms of immunomodulation on T cells treated with exosomes harvested from septic mice. Blood cytokines/chemokines existed in both the soluble form and in the insoluble exosomal form; the profiles of the cytokines/chemokines in these two forms displayed different dynamics in the blood of mice challenged with LPS. Exosomes from septic mice induced the differentiation of Th1/Th2 cells, which was blocked by specific antibodies targeting IL-12 and IL-4. In addition, these exosomes significantly augmented the proliferation and migration of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, preadministration of exosomes by intravenous injection restrained the inflammatory response, attenuated lung and liver tissue damage, and prolonged the survival of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Our results indicate that exosomes enriched with cytokines/chemokines play critical roles in T cell differentiation, proliferation and chemotaxis during the sepsis process and have a protective effect on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice.

We demonstrate the framework for regression, classification and segmentation tasks with two different network architectures. We show that not only can the framework harmonise many-site datasets but it can also adapt to many data scenarios, including biased datasets and limited training labels.

These kinds of terminologies are considered useful for standardizing terms and encoding data and are currently used in many existing information systems. However, they suffer from a number of limitations that make data reuse difficult. Relatively recently, it has been proposed that formal ontological methods can be applied to some of the problems of terminological design. Biomedical ontologies organize concepts (embodiments of knowledge about biomedical reality) whereas terminologies organize terms (what is used to code patient data at a certain point in time, based on the particular terminology version). However, the application of these methods to existing terminologies is not straightforward. The use of these terminologies is firmly entrenched in many systems, and what might seem to be a simple option of replacing these terminologies is not possible. Moreover, these terminologies evolve over time in order to suit the needs of users. Any methodology must therefore take these constraints into consideration, hence the need for formal methods of managing changes. Along these lines, we have developed a formal representation of the concept-term relation, around which we have also developed a methodology for management of terminology changes. The objective of this study was to determine whether our methodology would result in improved retrieval of data. DESIGN: Comparison of two methods for retrieving data encoded with terms from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM), based on their recall when retrieving data for ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed but which had retained their original meaning (code change). MEASUREMENTS: Recall and interclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were detected (p<0.05) with the McNemar test for two terms whose codes had changed. Furthermore, when all the cases are combined in an overall category, our method also performs statistically significantly better (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that an ontology-based ICD-9-CM data retrieval method that takes into account the effects of terminology changes performs better on recall than one that does not in the retrieval of data for terms whose codes had changed but which retained their original meaning.","output":"A Comparison of Two Methods for Retrieving ICD-9-CM data: The Effect of Using an Ontology-based Method for Handling Terminology Changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant negative effect on people's health, as well as on the world's economy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the main tests used to detect COVID-19 infection. However, it is expensive, time-consuming, and lacks sufficient accuracy. In recent years, convolutional neural networks have grabbed many researchers' attention in the machine learning field, due to its high diagnosis accuracy, especially the medical image recognition. Many architectures such as Inception, ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG16 have been proposed and gained an excellent performance at a low computational cost. Moreover, in a way to accelerate the training of these traditional architectures, residual connections are combined with inception architecture. Therefore, many hybrid architectures such as Inception-ResNetV2 are further introduced. This paper proposes an enhanced Inception-ResNetV2 deep learning model that can diagnose chest X-ray (CXR) scans with high accuracy. Besides, a Grad-CAM algorithm is used to enhance the visualization of the infected regions of the lungs in CXR images.

Paradoxically, many viral and non\\\\viral pathogens target lectins to attach to immune cells and to subvert cellular functions to promote their spread. Thus, it has been proposed that attachment of HIV to the dendritic cell lectin DC\\\\SIGN enables the virus to hijack cellular transport processes to ensure its transmission to adjacent T cells. However, recent studies show that the consequences of viral capture by immune cell lectins can be diverse, and can entail negative and positive regulation of viral spread.

Recent literature states that chatbots, if implemented effectively, could be useful tools for quickly sharing information, promoting healthy behaviors, and helping reduce the psychological burden of isolation. The aim of this project is to develop and test a secure and reliable computerized decision support system (CDSS) in web-app and evaluate its use, usability and its outputs in a pre-specified way. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team was recruited to plan and design, based on the SMASS medical CDSS, the scenarios of the COVID-Guide web-app, a self-triage system for patients with suspected covid-19. The output data for the period May-September 2020 from Germany were analyzed. RESULTS: During the period under review, the total number of consultations in Germany was 96,012. 3,415 (3.56%) consultations indicated the need for immediate evaluation, by activating the emergency service (calling an ambulance) - 1,942, equal to 2.02% - or by advising the patient to go to hospital - 1,743, equal to 1.54%. CONCLUSIONS: Data seems to show good usability and a consistent number of consultations carried out. Regular use of COVID-Guide could help collect epidemiological data on the spread of (suspected) covid-19 cases, easily and quickly available in all countries where the tool will be used. Using the SSDC could help reduce the load on operators.

Accordingly, people may be especially motivated to consume nostalgia-inducing media in times of crisis. One such crisis that has strongly affected the personal lives of most people around the world is the global COVID-19 pandemic. In our study, we investigate the role of nostalgic media use during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate whether nostalgic media use has increased during the early 2020 lockdown, what kinds of media people used to become nostalgic, and how nostalgic media use is associated with well-being and escapism. In a cross-sectional panel survey conducted during lockdown measures in Germany in April and May 2020, participants (N = 534) were asked about their current stress, fear of isolation, nostalgic media usage, and functional as well as dysfunctional escapism. Controlling for nostalgia proneness, our findings indicate that nostalgic media usage was positively associated with fear of isolation and that it was related to both functional and dysfunctional escapism. Respondents in our survey most commonly used music, movies, and series and also (audio-)books, videogames, and private photos and videos to become nostalgic.

Molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19 were developed shortly after the isolation of SARS-CoV-2. However, serological tests based on antiviral antibody detection, revealing previous exposure to the virus, required longer testing phases, due to the need to obtain correctly folded and glycosylated antigens. The delay between the identification of a new virus and the development of reliable serodiagnostic tools limits our readiness to tackle future epidemics. We suggest that the protozoan Leishmania tarentolae can be used as an easy-to-handle microfactory for the rapid production of viral antigens to face emerging epidemics. We engineered L. tarentolae to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and we recorded the ability of the purified RBD antigen to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in human sera, with a sensitivity and reproducibility comparable to that of a reference antigen produced in human cells. This is the first application of an antigen produced in L. tarentolae for the serodiagnosis of a Coronaviridae infection. On the basis of our results, we propose L. tarentolae as an effective system for viral antigen production, even in countries that lack high-technology cell factories.","output":"Epidemic PreparednessLeishmania tarentolae as an Easy-to-Handle Tool to Produce Antigens for Viral Diagnosis: Application to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesTwo kinds of epidemic surveillance models are presented for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants so as to avert and stamp out a community-acquired outbreak (CAO) with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), tests, and vaccination. DesignThe surveillance of domestic cluster infections transmitted from imported cases with one-week time lag assessed by the Poisson model and the surveillance of whether, how and when NPIs and test contained the CAO with the SEIR model. SettingsBorder and Community of Taiwan. Main Outcome MeasurementsThe expected number and the upper bound of the 95% credible interval (CrI) of weekly covid-19 cases compared with the observed number for assessing the threshold of a CAO; effective reproductive number (Rt) and the effectiveness of NPIs for containing a CAO. ResultsFor the period of January-September 2020 when the wild type and the D614G period were prevailing, an increase in one imported case prior to one week would lead to 9.54% (95% CrI 6.44% to 12.59%) higher risk of domestic cluster infection that provides a one-week prior alert signal for more stringent NPIs and active testing locally. Accordingly, there was an absence of CAO until the Alpha VOC period of February 2021. However, given level one of NPI alert the risk of domestic cluster infections was gradually elevated to 14.14% (95% CrI 5.41% to 25.10%), leading to the Alpha VOC CAOs of six hotspots around mid-May 2021. It took two-and-half months for containing this CAO mainly with level three of NPI alert and rapid test and partially by the rolling out of vaccination. By applying the SEIR model, the Rt decreased from 4.0 at beginning to 0.7 on 31 July 2021 in parallel with the escalating NPIs from 30% to 90%. Containing a small outbreak of Delta VOC during this CAO period was also evaluated and demonstrated. After controlling the CAO, it again returned to imported-domestic transmission for Delta VOC from July until September 2021, giving an estimate of 10.16% (95% CrI: 7.01% to 13.59%) for the risk of several small cluster infections. However, there was an absence of CAO that resulted from the effectiveness of NPIs and tests, and the rapid expansion of vaccination. ConclusionsAverting and containing CAOs of SARS-CoV-2 variants are demonstrated by two kinds of epidemic surveillance models that have been applied to Taiwan scenario. These two models can be accommodated to monitor the epidemic of forthcoming emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs with various circumstances of vaccine coverage, NPIs, and tests in countries worldwide.","output":"Epidemic Surveillance Models for Containing the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants: Taiwan Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Covid-19 is not just a respiratory virus, it can show up atypically and does not discriminate age, gender or health status. Many people have had the disease with just mild symptoms. However, symptoms can vary from as simple as flu-like illness to severe systemic disease leading to dead. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case of a 41-year-old Latin-American female who came to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of general malaise after arriving from Dominican Republic. Symptoms started 1.5 week, associated with myalgias, subjective fever, fatigue, dyspnea non-proportional to exertion and SOB, which progressed to chest discomfort relieved by sitting up and worsened by lying down. Physical examination was remarkable for a toxic appearing patient, hemodynamically stable on mild distress due to generalized muscle aches. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination revealed tachycardia without murmurs, rubs, gallops or JVD. No edema or cyanosis noted. Abdominal exam revealed diffuse moderate tenderness without peritoneal sign. Labs revealed leukocytosis with left shift, mild transaminitis, lactic acidemia and elevated cardiac troponins. COVID-19 antigen test was positive. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions. Bedside ultrasound revealed pericardial effusion with diastolic right ventricular collapse. Patient was immediately managed with aggressive intravenous isotonic fluid. Afterwards, patient developed tachypnea, neurological and hemodynamic deterioration. Patient was endotracheally intubated and sono-guided pericardiocentesis was performed. Post-procedure cardiac sonogram revealed resolution of pericardial effusion, however poor cardiac contractility and hypotension noted for which was placed on Norepinephrine and Dobutamine Drip with improvement of hemodynamics. Despite management patient underwent cardiac arrest and died. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 infection presents with a wide variety of symptoms, which leads to a diagnostic challenge since have demonstrated to be more than a respiratory virus. This case is an example of clinically suspected myocarditis by COVID-19 virus, which shown this virus have myotropic effects. Our patient presented with predominantly with signs and symptoms of right heart dysfunction secondary to pericardial effusion complicated by suspected fulminant clinical myocarditis w/o typical changes in lung imaging. Unfortunately, patient was not stable to undergo endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac MRI. However, patient fulfilled clinical criteria for diagnosis.

Recent works have identified critical components of the purinergic signaling network (Pannexin-1 channels, ectonucleotidases, purinergic P1 and P2 receptors) involved in inflammation in a number of pathologic states including lung IRI. In addition, a functionally-related calcium channel, the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channel, has recently been linked to purinergic signaling and has also been shown to mediate lung IRI.

The study addressed confounding through large-scale propensity score adjustment and negative control experiments. RESULTS: Following over 1.1 million antihypertensive users identified between November 2019 and January 2020, we observed no significant difference in relative COVID-19 diagnosis risk comparing ACE/ARB vs CCB/THZ monotherapy (hazard ratio: 0.98; 95% CI 0.84 C 1.14), nor any difference for mono/combination use (1.01; 0.90 C 1.15).

The bivariate analysis identified sex and the level of physical activity as potential risk factors for the level of mental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is necessary to investigate specific symptoms of mental stress and the overall long-term impact on mental health.","output":"Mental health impairment triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample population of German students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: A case of uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management in a pediatric patient with a ventricular assist device awaiting a heart transplant is reported. SUMMARY: A 4-month-old male in heart failure was experiencing uncontrolled hypertension. Because of a lack of hemodynamic stability, he was unable to be listed as a heart transplant candidate. He received multiple antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, ?-blockers, and direct-acting vasodilators) as both intermittent and continuous infusions over the course of several days without achieving normotension. The decision was then made to administer intravenous phentolamine as a continuous infusion to pursue a different mechanism than with traditional antihypertensive agents to achieve hemodynamic stability. Within 8 hours of initiation of the continuous phentolamine infusion, the patient became normotensive and was listed for a heart transplant. The continuous phentolamine infusion was administered over the next 4 days to maintain normotension, and on day 4 the patient underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. CONCLUSION: A 4-month-old male in heart failure with a ventricular assist device, experiencing uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management, was successfully treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine.","output":"Phentolamine continuous infusion in a pediatric patient with uncontrolled hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the human population represents a tremendous medical and economic crisis.

Design/methodology/approach: Exploratory methodology consisting of the literature review and an empirical study was conducted. The theoretical framework of resilience strategy was built to provide a guideline for the empirical study. The empirical study involves a longitudinal study with 30 traditional retailers located in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The empirical data was collected using semi-structured interviews in mid-2019 and mid-2020, corresponding to the condition before and during the pandemic. Secondary data sources were also examined to refine the empirical evidence. Findings: The findings confirm that the pandemic has created disruptions in supply and demand, subsequently affecting operations. 90% of the traditional retailers experienced demand reduction, which varied among the retailers (M = 47%, SD = 25%), and 10% of the traditional retailers have not received any profit. The majority of the traditional retailer adopted reactive rather than proactive strategies. To cope with the pandemic, the traditional retailers have focused on efficient strategies and implemented exploitation-oriented strategies combined with exploration-oriented strategies. Trust and social capital were also discovered to explain the reasons behind the resiliency and sustainability of the traditional retailers. Research limitations/implications: Due to the preliminary and explorative nature of the present study, the generality of the findings may therefore be limited. Future research focusing on quantitative analysis using a large sample helps to achieve the generality of the findings. Practical implications: Because the strategies implemented in large enterprises (LEs) usually do not fit in micro-, small-, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), exploring strategies that are consistent with the characteristics of MSMEs and leverage their potentials is necessary. Building ambidextrous retailers through leveraging social capital/network and informal forum, exploiting affordable technology (e.g., social media, marketplace), and honing innovativeness is a way to survive in a dynamic environment. Social implications: Because the traditional retailers have contributed to economic development and social function, the government should empower them to leverage their capabilities through training and strengthen their business ecosystem through collective actions. Originality/value: The study contributes to the resilience body of knowledge concerning the strategies implemented by the traditional retailers during a long and unpredictable disruption in a developing country setting, which is scarce in the literature.","output":"Survival strategies of traditional retailers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Some insights from a developing country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To examine the impact of autoimmune disease on the composite outcome of intensive care unit admission, intubation, or death, from COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. METHODS Retrospective cohort study of 186 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1st-April 15th, 2020 at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. The cohort included 62 patients with autoimmune disease and 124 age- and sex-matched controls. The primary outcome was a composite of intensive care unit admission, intubation, and death, with secondary outcome assessing time to in-hospital death. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, medications, vital signs, and laboratory values were collected. Conditional logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess the association between autoimmune disease and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Patients with autoimmune disease were more likely to have at least one comorbidity (25.8% vs. 12.9%, p=0.03), take chronic immunosuppressive medications (66.1% vs. 4.0%, p<0.01), and have had a solid organ transplant (16.1% vs. 1.6%, p<0.01). There were no significant differences in intensive care unit admission (14.2% vs. 19.4%, p=0.44), intubation (14.2% vs. 17.7%, p=0.62) or death (17.5% vs. 14.5%, p=0.77). On multivariable analysis, patients with autoimmune disease were not at an increased risk for a composite outcome of intensive care unit admission, intubation, or death (adjOR 0.79, 95%CI 0.37-1.67). On Cox regression, autoimmune disease was not associated with in-hospital mortality (adjHR 0.73, 95%CI 0.33-1.63).

In response, the American Society of Hematology proposed several strategies to decrease blood utilization, while maintaining adequate disease control for sickle cell patients on CTT. These included targeting a higher end hemoglobin S%, switching patients to simple transfusions when appropriate, and transitioning to alternative disease modifying therapies. There is little evidence to support the safety of altering exchange therapy regimens. Accordingly, at the Johns Hopkins Sickle Cell Center for Adults, a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and transfusion medicine specialists evaluated patients on a case by case basis to determine how their exchanges could be modified to accommodate for anticipated blood supply shortages. We describe our blood conservation efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting clinical outcomes for adult patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Methods: For inclusion in this IRB-approved retrospective study, patients received at least 7 monthly exchange transfusions between March 2019 and February 2020 and continued care through March 2021. Decisions regarding CTT were made prior to data collection. Modifications to chronic exchanges included increasing the fraction of cells remaining (FCR), decreasing the end hematocrit, or switching to a hemodilution method. Additionally, select patients transitioned to monthly simple transfusions if they were clinically stable, had a hemoglobin  7 g/dL, and had a persistently suppressed hemoglobin S% ( 30). We collected basic demographics, pre-exchange laboratory studies, and exchange parameters before and after each transfusion encounter in the year before (March 2019 - February 2020) and during (March 2020 - February 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, we recorded presentations to urgent care and the emergency department;and hospital admissions during each time period. We reported descriptive statistics for the cohort and compared outcomes using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann Whitney U test. We analyzed data using Stata/SE Version 16.1. Results: We identified 58 patients with SCA who qualified for inclusion (Table 1). Fifty-three patients remained on chronic exchange transfusions during the pandemic, and five were switched to simple transfusions. For patients who remained on chronic exchanges, most received conventional automated red cell exchange (RCE) prior to (85%) and during the pandemic (77%). Use of hemodilution increased (15% to 23% of patients). Forty-three patients experienced an increase in mean FCR (33.6 (SD 11.6) vs 37.7 (4.7), p =.00). Of those, 22 patients saw a concomitant decrease in mean end hematocrit (30.8 (1.7) vs 29.6 (1.1), p =.00). These changes resulted in a decline in the average number of units per procedure (8.6 (1.9) vs 7.3 (1.7), p =.00), which corresponded to 890 units conserved. Mean pre-transfusion hemoglobin values declined (9.4 (1.3) vs 9.2 (1.3), p = 0.01), but hemoglobin S%, reticulocyte count, and ferritin values were unchanged (p > 0.05). Acute care presentations and hospital admissions declined, which were likely spurred by concerns about COVID-19 infection (Table 2, p < 0.05). During the pandemic, three patients died, one of whom had been switched to simple transfusions. This patient experienced a consistent rise in hemoglobin S% until death. Two of the remaining patients on simple transfusions were switched back to automated RCE due to an increase in hemoglobin S% above goal (Figure 1). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we conserved red blood cell units through expanded use of hemodilution, higher FCR values, and switching some patients to simple transfusions. Patients who remained on exchanges maintained hemoglobin S% values near a goal of 30% without increasing iron burden. In contrast, the majority of patients who were switched to simple transfusions were unable to maintain goal hematologic parameters, and one patient died. Our data suggest that in a blood shortage crisis, changing the exchange procedure itself may be the safest means of conserving blood in a population of adult sickle cell patients;however longer follow-up is needed to ensure that these changes are safe.

The complement system has been suggested to play a causative role in ventilator-induced lung injury. AIMS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study investigating associations between pulmonary levels of complement activation products and two ventilator settings, tidal volume (V(T)) and driving pressure (P), in critically ill patients under invasive ventilation. A miniature bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed for determination of pulmonary levels of C5a, C3b/c, and C4b/c. The primary endpoint was the correlation between BAL fluid (BALF) levels of C5a and V(T) and P. Levels of complement activation products were also compared between patients with and without ARDS or with and without pneumonia. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were included. Median time from start of invasive ventilation till BAL was 27 [19 to 34] hours. Median V(T) and P before BAL were 6.7 [IQR 6.1 to 7.6] ml/kg predicted bodyweight (PBW) and 15 [IQR 11 to 18] cm H(2)O, respectively. BALF levels of C5a, C3b/c and C4b/c were neither different between patients with or without ARDS, nor between patients with or without pneumonia. BALF levels of C5a, and also C3b/c and C4b/c, did not correlate with V(T) and P. Median BALF levels of C5a, C3b/c, and C4b/c, and the effects of V(T) and P on those levels, were not different between patients with or without ARDS, and in patients with or without pneumonia. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients under invasive ventilation, pulmonary levels of complement activation products were independent of the size of V(T) and the level of P. The associations were not different for patients with ARDS or with pneumonia. Pulmonary complement activation does not seem to play a major role in VILI, and not even in lung injury per se, in critically ill patients under invasive ventilation.","output":"The effects of tidal volume size and driving pressure levels on pulmonary complement activation: an observational study in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteolytic enzymes have great significance in medicine and the pharmaceutical industry and are applied in multiple fields of life sciences. Therefore, cost-efficient, reliable and sensitive real-time monitoring methods are highly desirable to measure protease activity. In this paper, we describe the development of a new experimental approach for investigation of proteolytic enzymes. The method was designed by the combination of recombinant fusion protein substrates and bio-layer interferometry (BLI). The protease (PR) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was applied as model enzyme to set up and test the method. The principle of the assay is that the recombinant protein substrates immobilized to the surface of biosensor are specifically cleaved by the PR, and the substrate processing can be followed by measuring change in the layer thickness by optical measurement. We successfully used this method to detect the HIV-1 PR activity in real time, and the initial rate of the signal decrease was found to be proportional to the enzyme activity. Substrates representing wild-type and modified cleavage sites were designed to study HIV-1 PRs specificity, and the BLI-based measurements showed differential cleavage efficiency of the substrates, which was proven by enzyme kinetic measurements. We applied this BLI-based assay to experimentally confirm the existence of extended binding sites at the surface of HIV-1 PR. We found the measurements may be performed using lysates of cells expressing the fusion protein, without primary purification of the substrate. The designed BLI-based protease assay is high-throughput-compatible and enables real-time and small-volume measurements, thus providing a new and versatile approach to study proteolytic enzymes.","output":"Development of a Bio-Layer Interferometry-Based Protease Assay Using HIV-1 Protease as a Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Nissen and Toupet fundoplications are the most commonly used techniques for surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. To date, no population-based trend analysis has been reported examining the choice of procedure and short-term outcomes. This study was designed to analyze trends in the use of Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications, and corresponding short-term outcomes during a 10-year period between 1995 and 2004. METHODS A trend analysis was performed of 873 patients (Toupet: 254 patients, Nissen: 619 patients) prospectively enrolled in the database of the Swiss Association for Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery. RESULTS The frequency of the performed techniques remained stable during the observation period (p value for trend 0.206). The average postoperative and total length of hospital stay both significantly decreased during the 10-year period from 5.6 to 4.0 days and 6.8 to 4.8 days, respectively (both p values for trend <0.001). The average duration of surgery decreased significantly from 141 minutes to 121 minutes (p value for trend <0.001). There was a trend towards less complications in later years (2000-2004) compared to early years (1995-1999, p = 0.058). Conversion rates were significantly lower in later years compared with early years (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS This is the first trend analysis in the literature reporting clinical outcomes of 873 prospectively enrolled patients undergoing Nissen and Toupet fundoplications during a 10-year period. The proportion of laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications remained stable over time, indicating that literature reports of the advantages of one procedure over the other had minimal influence on surgeons' choice of technique. Length of hospital stay, duration of surgery, morbidity, and conversion rate decreased over time, reflecting the learning curve.

However, the role of IBV as an enteric pathogen in still controversial. In Brazil, antigenic groups of IBV divergent from the Massachusetts serotype used for vaccination schedules in that country have already been demonstrated. The present study aimed to assess the different genotypes of IBV in Brazilian commercial poultry flocks by partial sequencing of the S1 amino-terminus coding region using enteric contents as samples and examine their relationship with the vaccine serotype currently in use. Samples of enteric contents were taken as pools of five birds from each of 18 poultry farms (17 broiler and one laying farm) from five Brazilian states between 2002 and 2006. Birds were presenting watery diarrhea and poor general condition but were without respiratory, renal, or reproductive signs. Conventional antibacterial and anticoccidial therapies were unsuccessful and, furthermore, all samples proved negative for rotavirus, reovirus, and astrovirus. Eleven IBV samples were isolated in embryonated eggs and resulted in S1 sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these segregated into an exclusive cluster, close to serotype D274, but distant from Massachusetts. Mean amino acid identity amongst these Brazilian strains was 94.07%; amongst these and serotypes D274, 4/91, and Massachusetts, mean amino acid identity was 77.17%, 69.94%, and 68.93%, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of genotype variant strains of IBV in Brazilian poultry flocks has been demonstrated and might be the reason for the unsuccessful control of IBV in Brazil.

The guide aims to clarify ambiguity and misperceptions surrounding the U.S. governments government patent use power under  1498. It explains, in accessible language, the substantive powers that  1498 provides to U.S. government officials, and it explains what effective and successful use of  1498 looks like in practice. The guide takes a comprehensive approach, outlining what U.S. government officials should expect from contractors, patent holders, and courts before, during, and after using a patent pursuant to  1498.Together, the sections below highlight  1498s broad scope and its highly flexible application to any and all patented technology, regardless of whether the technology was developed with public or private money. Section 1498 permits the U.S. government to useand thereby expand public access toany technology covered by a U.S. patent. Any time a patent stands in the way of government procuremente.g., when a particular patent holder asks an unreasonable price, or is unable to manufacture enough of a patented product to meet the governments supply needs 1498 can be used to procure the product from competitors, or to allow the government to manufacture the product itself. As a result,  1498 has broad utility. In years past, the statute has been used in many different technological contextsincluding, for example, pharmaceuticals, military equipment, and financial technologyand it could be applied in any number of technological contexts in the future. SECTION 1 of this guide highlights some problematic features of the patent system, which  1498a core part of the U.S. patent system for over a centuryis well suited to correct. While acknowledging the important role that patents play as economic incentives for innovation, Section 1 focuses on the enormous costs, both human and economic, that can result from healthcare corporations strategic, profit-maximizing use of patents. For example, patents have sustained the high prices of life-saving drugs for hepatitis C infection and HIV/AIDS, prolonging these costly and deadly epidemics. Further, the U.S. has faced preventable shortages of treatments, tests, and other supplies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortages of one COVID-19 treatment in particular, remdesivir, grew so severe in the summer of 2020 that patients and doctors were forced to ration the drug;these were exacerbated by patents that blocked competition and expanded supply. Section 1498 can address such problems, as the remainder of the guide explains. SECTION 2 provides a legal and historical overview of  1498. It introduces the text of  1498 and clarifies its meaning: the U.S. government has the authority to use or manufacture any patented invention, without the consent of the patent holder, in return for reasonable and entire compensation to the patent holder. Section 2 then summarizes how this authority functions in practice, describing when and how government patent use occurs and by providing brief historical examples of patent use under  1498. It highlights the versatility of  1498, including the laws value as leverage in a negotiation (where the mere prospect of government patent use, without actual exercise of the power, may bring patent holders to the negotiating table). SECTION 3 describes in detail how  1498 operates in practice. Section 3 begins by describing a first type of government patent use under  1498: direct, independent government patent use, in which the U.S. government itself makes, sells, and/or distributes a patented invention. Section 3 then describes a second type of government patent use: third-party use on behalf of the government, which is included within the statute as patent use for the U.S. government. Section 3 al o explains the flexible government use test that courts have created to establish whether a third partys use of a patent is properly for the U.S. government and therefore covered by  1498, and it provides a roadmap for U.S. government officials to meet the government use test. SECTION 4 details litigation that may arise upon government patent use under  1498. Section 4 focuses primarily on the reasonable and entire compensation paid to a patent holder when the U.S. government uses their patent: what constitutes reasonable and entire compensation, and how is this value determined? Reasonable and entire compensation is determined by a federal court, the Court of Federal Claims, which has historically taken a conservative and even-handed approach that typically provides the patent holder with a reasonable royalty based on the market value of the patented invention. Section 4 provides specific examples and trends deduced from these data, which provide guidance to government policymakers on what to expect when using, pursuant to  1498, a particular patent in a particular instance. Finally, Section 4 reiterates the value of  1498 as leverage in negotiation and explains how  1498s compensation structure creates much of this leverage. SECTION 5 discusses government patent use under  1498 in the specific context of prescription drugs. Special considerations apply to pharmaceuticals because they are heavily regulated by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), and non-patent regulatory barriers to competition can affect the reach of government patent use. Section 5 explains, broadly, two distinct sets of facts that may apply to a given pharmaceutical. Under the first set of facts, patents are the only barriers to competition for a particular drug. Government patent use under  1498 is likely to solve these patent problemsto accelerate competition and expand accessquickly and straightforwardly. Under the second set of facts, additional non-patent statutory exclusivities prevent generic competitors from entering the market. Government patent use under  1498 cannot solve the latter sort of non-patent problems. However, the government may be able to coordinate with generic manufacturers to work around such non-patent exclusivities.","output":"A Guide to Government Patent Use, a Path to Licensing and Distributing Generic Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had an impact on healthcare systems around the world with 3 million people contracting the disease and 208,000 cases resulting in death as of this writing.

Study Design: This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020, and April 20, 2020. Severe disease was defined according to published criteria as patient-reported dyspnea, respiratory rate >30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on room air, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen <300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded from the study if they had presumed coronavirus disease 2019, but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported.

The following preexisting comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease, and the mean body mass index was 34 kg/m2. Gestational age was at a mean of 296 weeks at symptom onset and a mean of 306 weeks at hospital admission, with a median disease day 7 since first symptoms. Most women (81%) were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 7% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days [severe group] and 10.5 days [critical group]; P=.01). Intubation was usually performed around day 9 on patients who required it, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease was performed on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was required in 20% of cases, the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 70%, and reintubation was necessary in 20%. There was 1 case of maternal cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal death. Thirty-two of 64 (50%) women with coronavirus disease 2019 in this cohort delivered during their hospitalization (34% [severe group] and 85% [critical group]). Furthermore, 15 of 17 (88%) pregnant women with critical coronavirus disease 2019 delivered preterm during their disease course, with 16 of 17 (94%) pregnant women giving birth through cesarean delivery; overall, 15 of 20 (75%) women with critical disease delivered preterm. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths or cases of vertical transmission. Conclusion: In pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, admission into the hospital typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 [severe group] vs 12 [critical group]). Women with critical disease had a high rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and there was 1 case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal mortality. Hospitalization of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in delivery during the clinical course of the disease in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester. There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.","output":"Clinical course of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized pregnancies: a United States cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Increasing reports suggest that patients have been reluctant to present for care due to fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), even in the setting of ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction The impact of the ongoing pandemic on patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains unknown METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients presenting to a single referral center in Atlanta, Georgia, USA with aSAH between 2012 and 2020 SARSCoV- 2 was first reported in Georgia on March 2, 2020 All patients presenting from March through June of a given calendar year were compared from the pre-SARS-CoV-2 era (2012-2019) to the SARS-CoV-2 era (2020) Patient characteristics, latency from ictus to presentation, and clinical outcomes were compared RESULTS: A total of 472 patients presented with aSAH during the study period, with comparable distribution in the age, sex, and Hunt and Hess grade on presentation The mean latency in days from ictus to presentation was significantly longer in 2020 when compared to the pre- SARS-CoV-2 era (2 3, + 3 0 vs 0 9 + 2 2, respectively, p&lt; 05) Absolute rates of discharge home or in-hospital mortality were not significantly different In binary regression analysis, patients were more likely to present post-bleed day 2 or after (OR 3 9, 1 9-8 1, p&lt; 05) This effect was driven by delays to presentation in low grade aSAH (OR 3 2, 1 1-9 25, p&lt; 05) with no difference to time in presentation in highgrade aSAH (2 3, 0 25 - 21 6) The delay to presentation was persistent on multiple binary regression analysis after controlling for age and grade (aOR 3 7, 1 7-8 0, p&lt; 05) There was a non-significant trend towards increased mortality in the SARS-CoV-2 era on multiple regression analysis (2 78, 0 95-8 16) CONCLUSIONS: Similar to patients with myocardial and cerebral infarctions, patients are presenting for care later after an aSAH This effect is driven by low grade aSAH, as high grade aSAH patients with a more fulminant presentation are still largely presenting within the first day, similar to the pre- SARS-CoV-2 era These data highlight the ongoing collateral damage of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and need for vigilant public health efforts to encourage rapid presentation for care","output":"Delays to presentation and outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in the Sars-CoV-2 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we propose an application of humanitarian logistics theory to build a supportive framework for economic reactivation and pandemic management based on province vulnerability against COVID-19.

In this entity, the bleeding originates from the pulmonary microvasculature as a result of microvascular damage leading to blood leakage into the alveolar spaces. DAH can occur as an isolated medical entity or may be associated with other organ system injury or dysfunction. The classic triad of symptoms includes hemoptysis, anemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Hemoptysis is the usual presenting symptom but is not constant. A variety of diseases is associated with the development of DAH. Current classification organize the etiologies of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage based on the presence of severe immune disorders (such as systemic vasculitis and collagenosis) or non-immunodeficiency disorders (with an identified cardiac or non-cardiac origin, or idiopathic). The five cases of DAH presented in this study were all diagnosed in full-term infants, four males and one female, with normal neonatal adaptation and without family history of notable diseases. In all cases the diagnosis was made between the age of three and eighteen weeks-old. Moreover, all five patients, at the time of diagnosis, presented with hemoptysis, mild or severe dyspnea, anemia and abnormal chest X-rays. Consequently, the diagnosis of DAH was strongly suspected and, eventually, confirmed by bronchoscopy. Additional laboratory tests, as well as selected serologic and radiographic studies were performed in order to identify a specific etiology. The final diagnoses reflect a variety of causes: infections, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, accidental suffocation and Heiner syndrome.

Although agri-food systems were more resilient to shocks than other sectors of the economy, the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic increased unemployment, lowered overall incomes and purchasing power, forcing consumers to switch to cheaper diets. The identified problems are exacerbated by the continuing increase in land degradation and biodiversity and increasingly frequent adverse weather events. In this regard, taking into account the increasing degree of involvement of states in international processes, it seems relevant to study the provision of national food security of the Republic of Belarus in the context of global trends for the timely identification and anticipation of risks and threats. The paper presents the results of study of modern aspects of ensuring food security at the global and national levels. The tendencies of physical and economic accessibility of food in the domestic market are revealed, the assessment of level of nutrition and quality of life of population is presented. Prospective directions for improving the state policy in the field of food security are substantiated, aimed at the optimal use of production potential, maintaining supply of food to population at a level sufficient for healthy nutrition, eliminating dependence on unjustified imports, protecting the interests of domestic producers, as well as enhancing foreign economic activity.","output":"Ensuring Food Security of the Republic of Belarus in the Context of Global Trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The government of Afghanistan, with international partners and donors, has achieved substantial public health improvements during the past 8 years.

On this foundation, the concept of depression index is developed further, and the relationship between depression index and the severity of depression in patients is thoroughly investigated. The system can accurately and quickly identify the depression state by applying it directly to the original EEG signals, without any preprocessing or feature extraction.

Combining projections of future deforestation with species density information provides an improved way to anticipate such declines. Using the endemic and critically endangered Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) as a case study we applied a spatio-temporally explicit deforestation model to forest loss data from 2001-2017 and projected future impacts on orangutans to the 2030s. Our projections point to continued deforestation across the island, amounting to a loss of forest habitat for 26,200 (CI: 19,500C34,000) orangutans. Populations currently persisting in forests gazetted for industrial timber and oil palm concessions, or unprotected forests outside of concessions, were projected to experience the worst losses within the next 15 years, amounting to 15,400 (CI: 12,000C20,500) individuals. Lowland forests with high orangutan densities in West and Central Kalimantan were also projected to be at high risk from deforestation, irrespective of land-use. In contrast, most protected areas and logging concessions currently harboring orangutans will continue to face low levels of deforestation. Our business-as-usual projections indicate the importance of protected areas, efforts to prevent the conversion of logged forests for the survival of highly vulnerable wildlife, and protecting orangutan habitat in plantation landscapes.

Our objective was to evaluate the early effects of the pandemic on the emotional well-being of oncology providers across the United States and explore factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to United States cancer-care physicians recruited over a two-week period (3/27/2020C4/10/2020) using snowball-convenience sampling through social media. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). RESULTS: Of 486 participants, 374 (77.0%) completed the PHQ-4: median age was 43 years; 63.2% female; all oncologic specialties were represented. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 62.0% and 23.5%, respectively. Demographic factors associated with anxiety included female sex, younger age, and less time in clinical practice. Perception of inadequate personal protective equipment (68.6% vs. 57.4%, p = 0.03) and practicing in a state with more COVID-19 cases (65.8% vs. 51.1%, p = 0.01) were associated with anxiety symptoms. Factors significantly associated with both anxiety and depression included the degree to which COVID-19 has interfered with the ability to provide treatment to cancer patients and concern that patients will not receive the level of care needed for non-COVID-19 illness (all p-values <0.01).

SAMPLE: Eighty-four community members, the majority of whom were white, female, college educated completed the survey. MEASURES: Theory of planned behavior constructs: behavioral intentions, attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control for 3 social distancing behaviors: maintaining a 6-foot distance, avoiding places people congregate, and staying home as much as possible. ANALYSIS: Path analyses were conducted to understand significant determinants of intentions for each behavior to guide the development of locally tailored health promotion messages. RESULTS: The RCBD was implemented, and results were communicated to the community within 1 week. Intentions were high across the 3 behaviors but lowest for staying home as much as possible. Younger participants had lower intentions of maintaining a 6-foot distance than older participants.

Exposure and infection risk of nearby passengers was studied. The effect of gasper jet and backrest on risk mitigation was investigated. RESULTS: For the activity of coughing, the front passenger has much higher infection risk, which was around four times of that of other passengers, because of the concentration surge in the inhalation zone. For talking, the nearby passengers have similar infection risk because nearby passengers were all exposed to concentration surges with similar peak value. Gasper jet of the infected passenger and higher backrest can extinguish or reduce the concentration surge of front passengers and reduce the infection risk due to coughing and talking droplets.

METHODS Individuals entering a community garden in Montpellier (France) in 2018 (n = 66) were compared with pairwise matched individuals with no experience in community gardening (n = 66). Nutritional quality, environmental impact and cost of monthly household food supplies, level of physical activity measured by accelerometers, as well as mental and social well-being, sensitivity to food waste, and connection with nature were evaluated at baseline (t0) and 12 months later (t1) to explore sustainability of lifestyles in social/health, environmental and economic dimensions. Linear mixed models were used to determine the independent effect of community gardening on investigated lifestyles components. In-depth interviews were conducted at t1 with 15 gardeners to better understand changes that may have occurred in gardeners' lives during the first year of gardening. RESULTS At t0, gardeners had lower education level, lower BMI and their household reported lower percentage of meals consumed outside of the home compared to non-gardeners (p < 0.05). Participating in the community garden had no significant impact, in spite of sufficient statistical power, on fruit and vegetables supplies (main outcome), nor on physical activity parameters, nor on others of the social/health, environmental and economic lifestyles components investigated. Qualitative interviews suggested the existence of pre-established health and environmental consciousness in some gardeners and revealed several barriers to the participation such as lack of time, lack of gardening knowledge, physical difficulty of gardening, health problems and conflicts with other gardeners. CONCLUSIONS The health benefits of community gardening previously reported by cross-sectional studies might be confounded by selection bias. The JArDinS study highlights the need to identify solutions to overcome barriers related to community garden participation when designing relevant public health interventions for the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.

Host epigenome manipulation post coronavirus infection(2C4) suggests that DNA methylation signatures may differentiate patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from uninfected individuals, and help predict COVID-19 disease severity, even at initial presentation. METHODS: We customized Illuminas Infinium MethylationEPIC array to enhance immune response detection and profiled peripheral blood samples from 164 COVID-19 patients with longitudinal measurements of disease severity and 296 patient controls. RESULTS: Epigenome-wide association analysis revealed 13,033 genome-wide significant methylation sites for case-vs-control status. Genes and pathways involved in interferon signaling and viral response were significantly enriched among differentially methylated sites. We observe highly significant associations at genes previously reported in genetic association studies (e.g. IRF7, OAS1). Using machine learning techniques, models built using sparse regression yielded highly predictive findings: cross-validated best fit AUC was 93.6% for case-vs-control status, and 79.1%, 80.8%, and 84.4% for hospitalization, ICU admission, and progression to death, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the strong COVID-19-specific epigenetic signature in peripheral blood driven by key immune-related pathways related to infection status, disease severity, and clinical deterioration provides insights useful for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with viral infections.","output":"Host methylation predicts SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are being developed, which show practical preventive effects.

While this is not a recent phenomenon, it might prove a critical one in the context of current attempts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the task of designing policies suitable for attaining high levels of vaccination deserves enhanced attention.

Here we identify the host cell pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 and show that inhibition of these pathways prevents viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell-culture model for infection with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Using this cell-culture system, we determined the infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and nucleic acid metabolism. Small-molecule inhibitors that target these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and have enabled the identification of drugs that inhibit viral replication. We anticipate that our results will guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of host cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Given the importance of COVID-19 TP rates for understanding COVID-related morbidity, researchers and clinicians have become increasingly interested in comparing TP rates across countries. The statistical methods for performing such comparisons fall into two general categories: frequentist tests and Bayesian methods. Using data from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org), we performed comparisons for two prototypical yet disparate pairs of countries: Bolivia versus the United States (large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates), and South Korea vs. Uruguay (two very small TP rates of similar magnitude). Three different statistical procedures were used: two frequentist tests (an asymptotic z-test and the 'N-1' chi-square test), and a Bayesian method for comparing two proportions (TP rates are proportions). Results indicated that for the case of large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates (Bolivia versus the United States), the frequentist and Bayesian approaches both indicated that the two rates were substantially different. When the TP rates were very small and of similar magnitude (values of 0.009 and 0.007 for South Korea and Uruguay, respectively), the frequentist tests indicated a highly significant contrast, despite the apparent trivial amount by which the two rates differ. The Bayesian method, in comparison, suggested that the TP rates were practically equivalent-a finding that seems more consistent with the observed data. When TP rates are highly similar in magnitude, frequentist tests can lead to erroneous interpretations. A Bayesian approach, on the other hand, can help ensure more accurate inferences and thereby avoid potential decision errors that could lead to costly public health and policy-related consequences.","output":"Statistical methods for comparing test positivity rates between countries: Which method should be used and why?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several recent reports have described the involvement of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in cancer progression. Moreover, we ourselves were amongst the first to link NETs dysregulation to the COVID-19 pathogenesis1 . In response to infection, stimulated neutrophils play an important role as the first line of innate immune defense, by producing extensive extracellular structures composed of granular protein assembled on a scaffold of released chromatin. In addition to mechanically trapping microorganisms, and thus impeding their dissemination in blood, NETs exploits coagulant function to segregate them within the circulation2 , while NET by-products such as circulating DNA, histones, granule enzymes (Elastase, Myeloperoxidase,.) also contribute to the triggering of an inflammatory process. As most of the sterile or infectious diseases associated with NET imbalance, cancer is established as a COVID-19 comorbidity. We hypothese that NET formation may result in higher COVID-19 severity. Our objective is to highlight that high NETs formation result in higher COVID-19 severity in cancer patients infected with SARS-Cov2. We are involved in two concurrent clinical studies in which we analyze blood samples for testing NET by-products and formation: (i) in newly diagnosed mCRC patients;and (ii) in patients with intermediate and severe forms of COVID-19. Initial data has shown that the level of the main markers of NETs formation, such as Elastase (ELA2), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), or circulating DNA (cirDNA), are (i) highly correlated in more than 221 mCRC patients, and (ii) statistically (P<0.0001) different than in healthy individuals (N=76). Median concentration values in healthy individuals (n=76): cirDNA: 5,16ng/mL;ELA2: 11,83ng/mL and MPO conc: 12,37ng/mL. Median concentration values in mCRC patients (n=221): cirDNA: 18,36ng/mL;ELA2: 34,70ng/mL and MPO: 38,90ng/mL. CirDNA and MPO or ELA2 concentration do not statistically correlate in healthy individuals, while cirDNA, ELA2 and MPO highly correlate each other (p<0.0001). Since malignant cell derived mutant cirDNA and total cirDNA are similarly correlated with increased level of NET by-products, we speculate that increased tumor burden and increased NET formation are correlated. Thus, NET by-products might be exploited as tumor progression biomarkers which could also be used to guide the choice of immunological therapeutic options. Lastly, our initial data support the hypothesis that cancer-associated NET exacerbation further contributes to COVID-19 severity.","output":"The elevated level of the main markers of neutrophil extracellular traps in metastatic colorectal cancer plasma highlights the enhanced risk of severe forms of COVID-19 in cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a debt view to explain the dominant international role of the dollar.

While multiple approaches for feeding jejunal access exist, few studies have compared the efficacy of these techniques. The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term durability, re-intervention rates, and nutritional outcomes following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes with jejunal extension tubes (PEG-JET) versus laparoscopic jejunostomy tubes (j-tubes). METHODS Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent PEG-JET or laparoscopic jejunostomy tube placement from January 2005 through December 2015 at our institution. Thirty-day and long-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 105 patients underwent PEG-JET and 307 patients underwent laparoscopic j-tube placement during the defined study period. In terms of 30-day outcomes, patients who underwent PEG-JET placement were significantly more likely to experience a tube dislodgement event (p = 0.005) and undergo a re-intervention (p < 0.001). Patients who had a laparoscopic j-tube placed were significantly more likely to meet their enteral feeding goals (p = 0.002) and less likely to require nutritional supplementation with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (p < 0.001). With regard to long-term outcomes, patients who underwent PEG-JET placement were significantly more likely to experience tube occlusion (p < 0.001) and require an endoscopic or surgical tube re-intervention (p < 0.001). Patients who underwent laparoscopic j-tube placement were significantly more likely to experience a tube site leak (p = 0.015) but were less likely to require nutritional supplementation with TPN (p = 0.001).

The objective of this paper is to study encoding schemes available for data transmission and their application in terms of authentication protocols such as Kerberos and LDAP. Furthermore, it will also emphasize on the design of integration model of Kerberos and LDAP to Cloud and Shared Storage to evaluate the impact of ASN.1 vulnerability.","output":"Network Communication Encoding: A Study for Authentication Protocols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tardigrades in the genus Milnesium have complex double claws on each leg, which consist of two slender primary branches and two basal secondary branches.

Our aim was to focus on the impact of relevant clinical and laboratory factors on the protective effect of glucocorticoids on mortality. METHODS: We performed a sub-analysis of the multicenter Cardio-COVID-Italy registry, enrolling consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to 13 Italian cardiology units between March 1st, 2020, and April 9th, 2020. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 706 COVID-19 patients were included (n = 349 treated with glucocorticoids, n = 357 not treated with glucocorticoids). After adjustment for relevant covariates, use of glucocorticoids was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.72, p = 0.001). A significant interaction was observed between the protective effect of glucocorticoids on mortality and PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission (p = 0.042), oxygen saturation on admission (p = 0.017), and peak CRP (0.023). Such protective effect of glucocorticoids was mainly observed in patients with lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio (<300), lower oxygen saturation (<90%), and higher CRP (>100 mg/L).

Islamic lunar calendar is 11 days shorter than the Gregorian solar calendar, so the start of Ramadan changes every year and hours spent on fasting vary from 12 hours in Australia, to 21 hours in Sweden, with most countries have 11-16 hours of fasting on average. Patients with certain medical illness are exempted from fasting, however, many such patients partake in fasting. 1,2The long hours of fasting may be a risk factor for AKI in certain populations. We assess AKI in Ramadan of 2021, where the weather was moderately hot. Methods: Demographics, comorbidities, treatment, and 4 weeks outcome data for all nephrology consultation for AKI in four public hospitals in Kuwait during Ramadan of 2021 (13/April to 12/May/2021) prospectively collected and analyzed. We compare AKI in people fasting prior to admission to non-fasting. Results: Total number of AKI cases during Ramadan was 158, 55% males, mean age 64, and 61% were Kuwaiti citizens. Community acquire cases were 15%. DM affected 75%, HTN 72%, and cardiac disease 25% of patients. Median baseline eGFR before AKI was 66.5.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of three different non-sternotomy techniques on long-term outcomes after left single-vessel revascularization. METHODS A total of 502 patients having single-vessel LAD disease treated from April 2003 to May 2013 by minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (MIDCAB), endoscopically assisted coronary artery bypass grafting (EACAB) or robotically assisted direct coronary artery bypass grafting (RADCAB) were reviewed. In all cases, distal anastomoses were performed through anterolateral minithoracotomy incisions. In-hospital and long-term (10-year) outcomes were compared using standard and propensity score-adjusted analyses. RESULTS One hundred and eighty-nine patients had MIDCAB, 76 had EACAB and 236 had RADCAB. After propensity score matching, RADCAB patients had significantly longer operative duration (P < 0.001), whereas MIDCAB and RADCAB patients had significantly higher incidence of postoperative angina over the follow-up (P = 0.034). The groups were comparable regarding in-hospital mortality and reintervention rate as well as incidence of myocardial infarction, reoperations, reinterventions and cardiac death.

New variants of the disease have different person-to-person variations in viral load, suggesting for example that the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant is more infectious but relatively less prone to superspreading. Meanwhile, mitigation of the pandemic has focused on limiting social contacts (lockdowns, regulations on gatherings) and decreasing transmission risk through mask wearing and social distancing. Using a mathematical model, we show that the competitive advantage of disease variants may heavily depend on the restrictions imposed. In particular, we find that lockdowns exert an evolutionary pressure which favours variants with lower levels of overdispersion. We find that overdispersion is an evolutionarily unstable trait, with a tendency for more homogeneously spreading variants to eventually dominate. SignificanceOne of the most important and complex properties of viral pathogens is their ability to mutate. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been characterized by overdispersion - a propensity for superspreading, which means that around 10% of those who become infected cause 80% of infections. However, evidence is mounting that this is not a stable property of the virus and that the Alpha variant spreads more homogeneously. We use a mathematical model to show that lockdowns exert a selection pressure, driving the pathogen towards more homogeneous transmission.

Serum vitamin D levels were measured, and patients with levels <20 ng/ml or 21 to 30 ng received a single 300.000 IU dose of vitamin D. RESULTS: Of 207 patients, 37 received vitamin D, while 170 did not. Demographic, radiologic and mean laboratory values were similar between the groups.

Methods: The NS Cancer Registry and the NS Prescription Monitoring Program (NSPMP) were used to link Nova Scotians who had a cancer diagnosis and received a prescription for opioids in their last year of life (n = 6,186) from 2005 to 2009. The association of factors with opioid dispensations at end-of-life were determined (e.g., patient demographics, type of prescriber, type of cancer, and opioid type, formulation, and dose). Results: Almost 54% (n = 6,186) of the end-of-life study population with cancer (n = 11,498) was linked to the NSPMP and therefore dispensed opioids. Most prescriptions were written by general practitioners (89%) and were for strong opioids (81%). Immediate-release formulations were more common than modified-release formulations. Although the annual average parenteral morphine equivalents (MEQ) did not change during the study period, the number of opioid prescriptions per patient per year increased from 5.9 in 2006 to 7.0 in 2009 (p < 0.0001). Patients age 80 and over received the fewest prescriptions (mean 3.9/year) and the lowest opioid doses (17.0 MEQ) while patients aged 40C49 received the most prescriptions (mean 14.5/year) and the highest doses of opioid (80.2 MEQ).

We provide information regarding how general practitioners prescribe opioid therapy to patients at end-of-life. Our data suggest that at the time of this study, there may have been under-prescribing of opioids to patients with cancer at end-of-life. This information can be used to increase awareness among general practitioners, and to inform recommendations from professional regulatory bodies, to aid in managing pain for cancer patients at end-of-life.

The PACIFIC trial reported improvements in progression-free and overall survival with adjuvant durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). We studied treatment decision-making by three Dutch regional thoracic multidisciplinary tumor boards between 2015 and 2019, to identify changes in practice when adjuvant durvalumab became available. METHODS: Details of patients presenting with stage III NSCLC were retrospectively collected. Both CCRT and multimodality schemes incorporating planned surgery were defined as being radical-intent treatment (RIT). RESULTS: Of 855 eligible patients, most (95%) were discussed at a thoracic multidisciplinary tumor board, which recommended a RIT in 63% (n = 510). Only 52% (n = 424) of the patients finally received a RIT. Predictors for not recommending RIT were age greater than or equal to 70 years, WHO performance score greater than or equal to 2, Charlson comorbidity index greater than or equal to 2 (excluding age), forced expiratory volume in 1 second less than 80% of predicted value, N3 disease, and period of diagnosis. Between 2015 to 2017 and 2018 to 2019, the proportion of patients undergoing CCRT increased from 34% to 42% (p = 0.02) and use of sequential chemoradiotherapy declined (21%C16%, p = 0.05). Rates of early toxicity and 1-year mortality were comparable for both periods. After 2018, 57% of the patients who underwent CCRT (90 of 159) received adjuvant durvalumab. CONCLUSIONS: After publication of the PACIFIC trial, a significant increase was observed in the use of CCRT for patients with stage III NSCLC with rates of early toxicity and mortality being unchanged. Since 2018, 57% of the patients undergoing CCRT went on to receive adjuvant durvalumab.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on 24/25 April 2020. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK. PARTICIPANTS: 545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work. Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media. Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19. No potential participants were excluded. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which participants worked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULTS: The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4% (n=13/545). The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4% (n=126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had higher seroprevalence (37.5% vs 17.1%, (2)=21.1034, p<0.0001) and quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%), with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02).

Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring the level of IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (anti-SRBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit and the level of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against variants of concern (VOCs) using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and pseudovirus neutralization test (pVNT). The safety profile was recorded by interviewing at the 1-month visit after vaccination. The anti-SRBD level after the second booster dose of the CoronaVac-ChAdOx1 group at 2 weeks was higher than 4 weeks. At 4 weeks after the second booster dose, the anti-SRBD level in the CoronaVac-ChAdOx1 group was significantly higher than either homologous CoronaVac, the homologous ChAdOx1 group, and Control group (p < 0.001).

CNS infection is quite unusual and is initiated either as a result of the viremia or, more rarely, as a result of neural spread. The poliovirus infects the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, causing poliomyelitis, the disease for which the virus is named. DNA vaccination is a relatively new entrant in the vaccine sweepstakes, but is viewed with optimism, for a number of reasons. DNA vaccines encoding the nucleoprotein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can confer protection against the normally lethal intracranial challenge. In rabies, in a mouse model, immunization with plasmids encoding the rabies glycoprotein conferred complete protection against subsequent viral challenge.

Furthermore, there have been extensive debates over antiviral candidates for their effectiveness and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that rapid preclinical animal studies are required to identify potential antiviral candidates for human trials. To this end, the antiviral efficacies of lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in the ferret infection model. While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the PBS-treated control group. Only the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed lower virus titers in nasal washes at 8 days postinfection (dpi) than the PBS-treated control group. To further explore the effect of immune suppression on viral infection and clinical outcome, ferrets were treated with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug. Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprine-immunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers.

CASE PRESENTATION: We treated a TBAD patient with large false lumen, compressed true lumen and multiple entries. After repeated wire misdirection to false lumen, we tried a new technique in which the wire in the false lumen was looped after entrance to true lumen and pushed distally. The looped wire was then used as guide to advance a second wire to the ascending aorta. TEVAR could then be completed with good result. DISCUSSION: Wiring the true lumen might be one of the most challenging steps during TEVAR in complicated TBAD. Several methods have been used to overcome the problems, but the cost and availability might be a problem in some countries. The looping wire technique may serve as an alternative method of guiding the process of wiring the true lumen during complicated TEVAR. CONCLUSION: Looping wire technique can be used as an alternative method to facilitate true lumen wiring during TEVAR.","output":"Looping wire technique to facilitate true lumen wiring during TEVAR in type B aortic dissection with aneurysmal degeneration: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early Lyme disease is often difficult to diagnose.

In this study which is the first report from Iran, we showed that olfactory dysfunction is a frequent clinical manifestation among COVID-19 patients. Methods: All patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to Arak hospitals in Iran. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data on patients with either laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time RT-PCR and/or chest CT Results: Most patients in our cohort had mild COVID-19 (104 [60.4%] of 172). Common symptoms at the onset of disease included (subjective) fever (131 [76%] of 172 patients), cough (130 [75.5%]), myalgia (107 [62%]) dyspnea (92 [53.5%]), chills (96 [55.8%]), and headache (94 [54.6%]). Olfactory dysfunction (OD), including anosmia, hyposmia, hyperosmia, and dysosmia, were reported by 61 ([36.5%] of 167) patients. The most common concurrent symptoms beside the olfactory dysfunctions, were fever (39 [69.6%] of 56 patients) and chills (26 [46.4%]), respectively. For the most part, the patients condition worsened after the notice of anosmia/dysgeusia (48 [85.7%] of 56 patients). The majority of anosmic patients were recovered from COVID-19 (50 [89.3%] of 56 patients). The anosmia/dysgeusia was resolved in 42 [75%] of 56 patients after two weeks.

Our aim was to evaluate the risk of VTE in individuals with severe AATD compared with control subjects from the general population. METHODS Individuals with severe AATD (n=1577) were recruited from the Swedish national AATD register. Control subjects (n=5969) were selected from the OLIN (Obstructive lung disease in Northern Sweden) studies, that include a random general population sample. Longitudinal data on VTE and diagnoses were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Registry. Associations were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression. RESULTS At inclusion, 46% of the AATD individuals and 53% of the controls were never-smokers. COPD was present in 46% of the AATD individuals compared with 4% of the controls. During a median follow-up of 18 years, 116 (7%) of the AATD individuals and 89 (1%) of the control subjects developed VTE, unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 6.5 (95% CI, 4.9-8.6). Risk factors for incident VTE were male gender, age, COPD, cancer and liver disease. Adjusting for these factors, the AATD individuals had a significantly higher risk of incident VTE, adjusted HR 4.2 (95% CI 2.9-6.2) as compared with the controls. CONCLUSION Subjects with severe AATD have considerably increased risk of developing VTE compared with the general population, even after accounting for risk factors.

We discuss the error of the method relative to the dimension of the model and clarify which methods are most suitable for the problem. We apply the method to two typical problems arising in chemical kinetics with time-independent extrinsic noise. Additionally, we show agreement with classical Monte Carlo simulations and calculate the variance over time as the sum of two expectations.

Diagnosis of abdominal TB is a daunting challenge owing to variable anatomical locations, paucibacillary nature of specimens and atypical clinical presentations that mimic other abdominal diseases, such as Crohn's disease and malignancies. In this review, we made a comprehensive study on the diagnosis of abdominal TB. AREA COVERED Various modalities employed for abdominal TB diagnosis include clinical features, imaging, bacteriological tests (smear/culture), histopathological/cytological observations, interferon-gamma release assays and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Among NAATs, loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay, PCR, multiplex-PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR and GeneXpert? MTB/RIF were discussed. Identification of circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell-free DNA by real-time PCR within ascitic fluids is another useful approach. EXPERT OPINION Several novel molecular/immunological methods, such as GeneXpert Ultra aptamer-linked immobilized sorbent assay, immuno-PCR (I-PCR) and nanoparticle-based I-PCR have recently been developed for detecting pulmonary TB and several EPTB types, which may also be explored for abdominal TB diagnosis. Precise and prompt diagnosis of abdominal TB may initiate an early therapy so as to reduce the complications, i.e. abdominal pain, ascites, abdominal distension, intestinal obstruction/perforation, etc. and avoid surgical involvement.","output":"Recent updates in diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis with emphasis on nucleic acid amplification tests."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no formally accepted pharmacological treatment for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included COVID-19 outpatients of a Peruvian primary care center from Lima, Peru, who were treated between April 30 - September 30, 2020, with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Logistic regression was applied to determine factors associated with case-fatality rate. RESULTS: A total of 1265 COVID-19 patients with an average age of 44.5 years were studied. Women represented 50.1% of patients, with an overall 5.9 symptom days, SpO2 97%, temperature of 37.3 C, 41% with at least one comorbidity and 96.1% one symptom or sign. No patient treated within the first 72 h of illness died. The factors associated with higher case fatality rate were age (OR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.01C1.11, p = 0.021), SpO2 (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.79C0.96, p = 0.005) and treatment onset (OR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.06C1.27, p = 0.002), being the latter the only associated in the multivariate analysis (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.05C1.32, p = 0.005). 0.6% of our patients died.

The 8 transmembrane isoforms of human CEACAM1 possess an extracellular N-terminal IgV domain, followed by variable numbers of IgC2 domains. To establish which key amino acids contribute specifically to CEACAM1 homophilic adhesion, exposed amino acids in the N-terminal domain of a soluble form of CEACAM1 were subjected to mutagenesis. Analyses of mutant proteins with conformationally dependent antibodies indicated that most mutations did not substantially affect the structural integrity of CEACAM1. Nevertheless, decreased adhesion was observed for the single mutants V39A or D40A (single-letter amino acid codes) in the CC' loop and for the triple mutants located in the GFCC'C\\" face of the N-terminal domain. Interestingly, whereas single mutations in R64 or D82 that are predicted to form a salt bridge between the base of the D and F beta strands close to the critical V39 and D40 residues also abolish adhesion, an amino acid swap (R64D and D82R), which maintains the salt bridge was without significant effect.

Based on the unifying property of affinity between autoantigens (autoAgs) and the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS), this paper reports 140 candidate autoAgs identified from proteome extracts of human Jurkat T-cells, of which at least 105 (75%) are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with currently available multi-omic COVID-19 data shows that 125 (89%) of DS-affinity proteins are altered at protein and/or RNA levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells or patients, with at least 94 being known autoAgs in a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases and cancer.

However, corresponding technological refinements are not yet available to fill the gap separating the current laparoscopy from the NOTES of the future. Meanwhile, \\"hybrid\\" NOTES techniques, including single-port procedures, have been increasingly reported. This report describes a technique of single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA) for selected patients with acute appendicitis. METHODS Patients with noncomplicated acute appendicitis, excluding those with abscess, perforation, peritonitis, previous surgery, or obesity, underwent SILA. The procedure was performed using a single 15-mm-diameter umbilical incision with two 5-mm-diameter port sites. RESULTS The study enrolled 36 women and 19 men with a mean age of 28 years (range, 18-78 years). The procedure was achieved for 41 patients (74.5%). The mean operative time was 39 min (range, 14-111 min). There was no mortality. The postoperative complication rate was 5.4% (3 complications in 3 patients), and the median hospital stay was 39 h (range, 8-240 h). CONCLUSION The SILA technique is safe and feasible for selected patients with noncomplicated acute appendicitis. Compared with other transumbilical techniques of appendectomy, SILA has the advantages of feasibility without endoscopic skills and an acceptable operative time.

The concurrent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 must not distract us from appreciating the fact that this Law will comprehensively overhaul the health regulatory framework of the world's most populous country during the coming decade, if not beyond. This article offers an original evaluation of the Law in its political context. The Law commendably promises to safeguard the right to health, assist citizens to live a 'complete cycle of life', and promote health using the resources of the public health system. However, it is also deeply politicised, guaranteeing extensive and penetrative political control in health campaigns, digitalised health data, the governance of health institutions, and the resolution of medical disputes. This can be explained by the consequential roles played by epidemics in China's historical dynastic cycles, but even more so by powerful tendencies of centralisation on the part of the Leninist Party-state. The Law's potential is thus subject to the overriding caveat that the Party-state's existence and influence over law and public health must be secured.","output":"The Political Determinants of China's New Health Constitution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Engineering the membrane of the polymersomes with biologically relevant stimuli-responsive units enables spatial and temporal controlled drug release for effective therapy. Herein, we introduce a new-type of polymersomes featuring reactive oxygen species singlet oxygen (1O2)-labile membrane by employing a versatile stereoregular amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(?-aminoacrylate)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers, which are synthesized through a facile one pot modular amino-alkynoate click polymerization between secondary amines and activated alkynes. These polymersomes readily co-encapsulate an anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and a near infrared (NIR) photosensitizer IR-780 with hydrophobic characteristics in the membrane, and the resulting polymersomes show efficient uptake by the tumor cells. NIR light irradiation on the tumors, following intraperitoneal injection of the IR-780/DOX co-encapsulated polymersomes, facilitates tumor-specific release of DOX through disassembly of the polymersome nanostructure via 1O2-mediated photocleavage of the membrane. Moreover, IR-780 dye can convert NIR light energy into heat in addition to the generation of 1O2, thus allows to realize both photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Accordingly, the NIR light-mediated on demand chemotherapy, in combination with appreciable phototherapy, of IR-780/DOX co-loaded polymersomes demonstrate an efficient tumor suppression in vivo.","output":"Polymersomes with singlet oxygen-labile poly(?-aminoacrylate) membrane for NIR light-controlled combined chemo-phototherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Participation in sport is viewed as a key means of improving health and wellbeing in many countries, but the processes constituting participation in community sports clubs remain poorly understood Although studies have considered the wellbeing implications of non-competitive and individual sporting activity, further theoretical and empirical work is required to understand (both sporting and non-sporting) participation in community sports clubs In this article we consider the contribution of approaches to social practice, situated wellbeing and affinities and atmospheres to advance our understanding Using the example of community cricket clubs in England and Wales, we consider the potential of such approaches and the implications of disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) crisis In conclusion, we argue that in a period characterised by political, social and economic turmoil, being able to provide detailed, place specific accounts of the important relations and practices existing in and through community sports clubs is a crucial activity for social scientists","output":"Understanding (disrupted) participation in community sports clubs: situated wellbeing, social practices and affinities and atmospheres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The balanced amelioration of mechanical characteristics of fat clay with an additive refers to the attainment of high strength without compromising ductility, which is unattainable by solitary usage of a cementing additive. For this purpose, an amalgamated binary admixture (ABA) is proposed by assimilating shredded face mask (FM) waste, which is posing serious environmental concerns these days, with a cementitious waste material, i.e., silica fume (SF). However, for such ABA, the optimization of mix design is desirable because an excessive amount of one component could disturb the required balance. To address this issue, response surface methodology (RSM) is used in the current study, which is a strong technique used during the process of production to develop, improve, and optimize product inputs. Several experiments are designed and conducted to evaluate mechanical responses, i.e., unconfined compressive strength (q(u)), brittleness index (I(B)), deformability index (I(D)), and California bearing ratio (CBR) value, of treated fat clay by varying mix designs of ABA. Based on the test results, mathematical models are developed which are found to be statistically valid to predict the subjected responses using SF and FM as inputs. Afterward, an optimized mix design is determined by integrating developed models with a desirability function model and setting maximization of strength and ductility as the optimization goals. An ABA having 7.9% SF and 1.2% FM is observed to provide the highest strength and ductility for multiple applications, i.e., road and buildings, with desirability factor close to unity; responses of which are also validated by performing tests.

This suggests that reaching herd-immunity might be facilitated during successive epidemic outbreaks (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 waves with different variants). Qualitative studies play down this possibility because cross-immune protection is seldom sterilizing. We use minimal quantitative models to study how cross-immunity affects epidemic dynamics over short and long timescales. In the short scale, we investigate models of sterilizing and attenuating immunity, finding equivalences between both mechanisms--thus suggesting a key role of attenuating protection in achieving herd immunity. Our models render maps in epidemic-parameter space that discern threatening variants depending on acquired cross-immunity levels. We illustrate this application with SARS-CoV-2 data, including protection due to vaccination rates across countries. In the long-time scale, we model sterilizing cross-immunity between rolling pathogens to characterize statistical properties of successful strains.

We have developed an approach for obtaining high confidence protein-protein interaction data by employing affinity tags and quantitative proteomics, in the context of viral infection, followed by robust statistical analysis. Using this approach, we identified high confidence interactors of NS5, the viral polymerase, and NS3, the helicase/protease. Quantitative proteomics allowed us to exclude a large number of presumably nonspecific interactors from our data sets and imparted a high level of confidence to our resulting data sets. We identified 53 host proteins reproducibly associated with NS5 and 41 with NS3, with 13 of these candidates present in both data sets.

Over-expression of ACE2 in human macrophages permits SARS-CoV-2 entry and early-stage replication and facilitates macrophage pro-inflammatory and anti-viral responses. ACE2 over-expression does not, however, permit the release of newly synthesised virions from SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages, consistent with abortive replication. Release of new, infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions from ACE2 over-expressing macrophages only occurred if anti-viral mediator induction was also blocked, indicating that macrophages restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection at two stages of the viral life cycle. These findings resolve the current controversy over macrophage-SARS-CoV-2 interactions and identify a signalling circuit that directly links macrophage recognition of SARS-CoV-2 to restriction of viral replication.

Neonatal mortality continues to remain high with little improvement over the years in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. This region shows the least progress in reducing neonatal mortality and continues to be a significant public health issue. In this study setting, the causes and predictors of neonatal death in the neonatal intensive care units are not well documented. Hence, this study aimed to determine the causes and predictors of neonatal mortality among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based in prospective follow-up study was conducted among neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals of eastern Ethiopia from November 1 to December 30, 2018. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and a follow-up checklist. The main outcomes and causes of death were set by pediatricians and medical residents. EpiData 3.1 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 25 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of facility-based neonatal mortality. RESULTS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal mortality was 20% (95% CI:16.7C23.8%). The causes of death were complications of preterm birth (28.58%), birth asphyxia (22.45%), neonatal infection (18.36%), meconium aspiration syndrome (9.18%), respiratory distress syndrome (7.14%), and congenital malformation (4.08%). Low birth weight, preterm births, length of stay of the neonatal intensive care unit, low 5 min APGAR score, hyperthermia, and initiation of feeding were predictors of neonatal death among infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal deaths was unacceptably high. The main causes of death were preventable and treatable. Hence, improving the timing and quality of antenatal care is essential for early detection, anticipating high-risk newborns, and timely interventions. Furthermore, early initiation of feeding and better referral linkage to tertiary health facilities could lead to a reduction in neonatal death in this setting.","output":"Cause and predictors of neonatal mortality among neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia: a facility-based prospective follow-up study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The overarching goal of this paper is to increase awareness among researchers and practitioners that refugees are disproportionally impacted by COVID-19, which increases their suffering Second, it extends a recently introduced transformative refugee service experience framework by integrating and conceptualizing refugees' resource and service inclusion during a pandemic Third, it explores lessons learned and implications from the COVID-19 pandemic for the future of service research and practice Design/methodology/approach: This study synthesizes approaches on refugees, resources and transformative service research to develop an extended framework for addressing one of society's pressing issues during and after pandemics Findings: Recognizing refugees as providing resources rather than just needing or depleting resources can enable more inclusion It facilitates refugees' integration into society by drawing on their skills and knowledge This requires hospitable refugee service systems that enable service inclusion and opportunities for refugee resource integration Research limitations/implications: This article focuses on one vulnerable group in society However, the extended framework presented warrants broader application to other contexts, such as subsistence marketplaces Practical implications: Managers of service businesses and public policymakers should create more inclusive and hospitable service systems for refugees This may result in redesigning services, changing consumer behavior and reformulating public policy Social implications: Better inclusion and integration of refugees and their resources should increase their individual well-being, reduce social issues in society, increase overall societal well-being and productivity Originality/value: This article presents a novel extended framework for service scholars and service providers to increase resource and service inclusion of refugees in a disaster context ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Creating hospitable service systems for refugees during a pandemic: leveraging resources for service inclusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Even though dentistry is becoming a women-dominated profession, this is not translating into the choosing oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialization. Hence, this study was undertaken to analyse factors impacting the choice of specialization and what impact does presence of role models as an intervention have on the attitudes of these young women on their overall career choice decisions. PURPOSE: This qualitative study was undertaken with the aim of understanding and analyzing the impact of role models on the overall shift in attitude of young women graduate students towards oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialty. METHODS: Eleven women maxillofacial faculties from all over the country participated in this study conducted during the 2020 Pandemic. In this study, through the online teaching programme, the influence of women teaching faculties in the form of role models was statistically analysed on 103 attendees out of 140 who answered the survey questionnaire. The sessions were conducted on Zoom platform in the form of lectures of graduate course topics as defined by Dental Council of India. The overall attitudinal shift was then statistically analysed through Chi-square test. RESULT: Out of 140 students, 103 students responded to the survey questionnaire. Responses of these students were statistically analysed with Chi-square test. The p value <.05 confirmed the hypothesis that presence of role models does have an impact on the choice of specialization. CONCLUSION: The sample size of this was small and the period of follow-up was short, four months. In order to validate these results, larger cohort and longitudinal studies of long follow-up are needed.

Although the mortality rate of COVID-19 is low, the high numbers of infected people and those with post-COVID-19 symptoms represent a real problem for the health system. A high number of patients with COVID-19 or people recovered from COVID-19 suffer from a dry cough and/or myalgia. Interestingly, an imbalance in bradykinin was observed in COVID-19 patients, which might be due to the accumulation of bradykinin as a result of a reduction in the degradation of bradykinin. This finding inspired the idea of possible similitude between the dry cough that is induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the COVID-19-induced dry cough. Both of these types of cough are mediated, at least partially, by bradykinin. They both manifested as a persistent dry cough that is not responded to traditional dry cough remedies. However, several drugs were previously investigated for the treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorCinduced dry cough. Here, we hypothesized that such treatment might be useful in COVID-19-induced dry cough and other bradykinin-related symptoms such as generalized pain and myalgia. In this article, evidence was presented to support the use of indomethacin as a potential treatment of COVID-19-induced dry cough. The choice of indomethacin was based on its ability to suppress the cyclooxygenase enzyme while also lowering the level of the inflammatory mediator bradykinin. Furthermore, indomethacin has been shown to be effective in treating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorCinduced dry cough. Moreover, indomethacin is a long-established, low-cost, effective, and readily available medication.","output":"Indomethacin: Can It Counteract Bradykinin Effects in COVID-19 Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is nationally and locally recognised that doses of critical medications are missed or omitted on a daily basis.

Teachers can assist children to acquire the skills, confidence, and creativity required to perform diverse movements and physical activities. However, to detect and directly intervene on the aspects of children's PL that are suboptimal, teachers require valid and reliable measures. This systematic review critically evaluates the psychometric properties of teacher proxy-report instruments for assessing one or more of the 30 elements within the four domains (physical, psychological, cognitive, social) of the Australian Physical Literacy Framework (APLF), in children aged 5-12 years. Secondary aims were to: examine alignment of each measure (and relevant items) with the APLF and provide recommendations for teachers in assessing PL. METHODS Seven electronic databases (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Complete, Education Source, Global Health, MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus) were systematically searched originally in October 2019, with an updated search in April 2021. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed English language publications that sampled a population of children with mean age between 5 and 12 years and focused on developing and evaluating at least one psychometric property of a teacher proxy-report instrument for assessing one or more of the 30 APLF elements. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance was followed for the conduct and reporting of this review. The methodological quality of included studies and quality of psychometric properties of identified tools were evaluated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidance. Alignment of each measure (and relevant items) with the APLF domains and 30 elements was appraised. RESULTS Database searches generated 61,412 citations; reduced to 41 studies that evaluated the psychometric properties of 24 teacher proxy-report tools. Six tools were classified as single domain measures (i.e. assessing a single domain of the APLF), eleven as dual-domain measures, and seven as tri-domain measures. No single tool captured all four domains and 30 elements of the APLF. Tools contained items that aligned with all physical, psychological, and social elements; however, four cognitive elements were not addressed by any measure. No tool was assessed for all nine psychometric properties outlined by COSMIN. Included studies reported a median of 3 out of nine psychometric properties. Most reported psychometric properties were construct validity (n = 32; 78% of studies), structural validity (n = 26; 63% of studies), and internal consistency (n = 25; 61% of studies). There was underreporting of content validity, cross-cultural validity, measurement error, and responsiveness. Psychometric data across tools were mostly indeterminate for construct validity, structural validity, and internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS There is limited evidence to fully support the use of a specific teacher proxy-report tool in practice. Further psychometric testing and detailed reporting of methodological aspects in future validity and reliability studies is needed. Tools have been designed to assess some elements of the framework. However, no comprehensive teacher proxy-report tool exists to assess all 30 elements of the APLF, demonstrating the need for a new tool. It is our recommendation that such tools be developed and psychometrically tested.

It has been previously found that tympanic temperature records can be used to detect influenza outbreaks in emergency departments. This study aimed to determine whether routine tympanic temperature readings collected by ambulance crews can be used to detect seasonal influenza. METHODS: Here we show that temperature readings do allow the detection of seasonal influenza before methods applied to conventional data sources. The counts of pyretic patients were used to calculate a sliding case ratio as a measurement to detect seasonal influenza outbreaks. This method does not rely on conventional thresholds and can be adapted to the data. RESULTS: The data collected correlated with seasonal influenza. The 2016/2017 outbreak was detected up to nine weeks before other surveillance programmes. The results show that ambulance records can be a useful data source for biosurveillance systems.

Unhealthy nutrition habits were eating fruits or vegetables for <5 d/week and ultra-processed food (sugary foods, snacks, ready-to-eat frozen foods and embedded foods) for &#8805;5 d/week. For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without unhealthy behaviour before the quarantine. We created four categories of change in TV-viewing and computer/tablet use, considering a cut-off point of 4 h/d for each behaviour (1 - consistently low, 2 - become low during the quarantine, 3 - become high during the quarantine or 4 - consistently high). Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, per capita income, working status during the quarantine, skin colour and adherence to the quarantine. SETTING: Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Brazilian adults (nationally representative). RESULTS: Logistic regression models revealed that high TV-viewing and computer/tablet use incidence were associated with higher odds for elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption (TV-viewing: OR 170; 95 % CI 137, 212; computer/tablet: OR 173; 95 % CI 131, 227) and low consumption of fruit and vegetables (TV-viewing: OR 170; 95 % CI 129, 223; computer/tablet: OR 153; 95 % CI 108, 217) incidence.

COVID-19 is associated with laryngeal oedema and a high rate of reintubation and difficult airway. Tracheostomy insertion is an aerosol generating procedure, so we strived to make our novel technique safe for operator and patient. Aim To share our experience of a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique, based on a case series of 18 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis. Method Our novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique is a landmark-based approach without bronchoscopic confirmation of the correct needle placement. Blunt dissection using tracheal dilators onto the tracheal rings facilitates first pass needle insertion into the trachea. The tracheal tube is retracted into the supraglottic airway, the cuff overinflated, and a wet throat pack inserted to reduce aerosolisation. Results From March 2020 to May 2020, 38 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 presented to Royal Bolton Hospital requiring invasive ventilation. 18 patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy. 6 patients have been decannulated, 12 patients died. Mean time from intubation to tracheostomy was 6.1 days and from tracheostomy to decannulation 20.6 days. No operator developed COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions Despite the low numbers our novel technique appears to be safe, but confirmation requires a larger controlled trial.

The intensity of the pandemic on a given territory is efficiently measured by the reproduction number, quantifying the rate of growth of daily new infections. Recently, estimates for the time evolution of the reproduction number were produced using an inverse problem formulation with a nonsmooth functional minimization. While it was designed to be robust to the limited quality of the Covid19 data (outliers, missing counts), the procedure lacks the ability to output credibility interval based estimates. This remains a severe limitation for practical use in actual pandemic monitoring by epidemiologists that the present work aims to overcome by use of Monte Carlo sampling. After interpretation of the functional into a Bayesian framework, several sampling schemes are tailored to adjust the nonsmooth nature of the resulting posterior distribution. The originality of the devised algorithms stems from combining a Langevin Monte Carlo sampling scheme with Proximal operators. Performance of the new algorithms in producing relevant credibility intervals for the reproduction number estimates and denoised counts are compared. Assessment is conducted on real daily new infection counts made available by the Johns Hopkins University.

Auxin-induced TMK1 nanoclustering stabilizes flotillin1-associated ordered nanodomains, which in turn promote the nanoclustering of ROP6 GTPase that acts downstream of TMK1 to regulate cortical microtubule organization. In turn, cortical microtubules further stabilize TMK1- and flotillin1-containing nanoclusters at the PM.

This study is dedicated to the development of an electrochemical determination method based on the application of molecularly imprinted polymer technology. The electrochemical sensor was designed by molecular imprinting of polypyrrole (Ppy) with SARS-CoV-2-S spike glycoprotein (MIP-Ppy). The electrochemical sensors with MIP-Ppy and with polypyrrole without imprints (NIP-Ppy) layers were electrochemically deposited on a platinum electrode surface by a sequence of potential pulses. The performance of polymer layers was evaluated by pulsed amperometric detection. According to the obtained results, a sensor based on MIP-Ppy is more sensitive to the SARS-CoV-2-S spike glycoprotein than a sensor based on NIP-Ppy. Also, the results demonstrate that the MIP-Ppy layer is more selectively interacting with SARS-CoV-2-S glycoprotein than with bovine serum albumin.

Telehealth programs for people with Parkinson's (PWP) disease may ensure continuity of care. The goal of this observational survey study was to determine the practicability, satisfaction, and barriers to online programs, their relationship to perceived symptoms, mood, and quality of life, and program sustainability beyond the immediate pandemic. METHODS: In-person Parkinson's programs at New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine transitioned online at the start of the pandemic to include Rock Steady Boxing, Support Groups, and Rock Steady Buddies. A custom online survey sent to 150 participants investigated PD history, symptomatology, level of exercise before and during the pandemic, depression (PHQ-9), quality of life (PDQ-39), and practicability and perceived satisfaction related to these online programs. Descriptive statistics were reported. RESULTS: Of 69 respondents [mean age of 70.2y (SD 8.4 yrs)], >75% were satisfied with the transition to online programs. Consistent attendance and minimal barriers to programs indicated practicability, with increased adherence to exercise. Of 66 completed PHQ-9s, 22.7% had scores 9 (moderate to severe depression); of 61 completed PDQ-39s, scores averaged 21.4; better quality of life than national averages for PWP. Self-perceived physical and mental wellbeing were positively affected. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest the transition to online programs met the needs of the Parkinson's community in a practicable and sustainable manner during the pandemic.

METHODS Two-hundred community participants completed the four subtests of the CBB on an iPad platform, during a free adult health check on two islands in the region, between October and December 2016. Acceptability was defined as completing the learning trial of a task and usability as continuing a task through to completion, determined by examiner acumen and internal Cogstate completion and integrity criteria. These were combined into a single dichotomous completion measure for logistic regression analyses. Performance-measured as reaction times and accuracy of responses-was analyzed using linear regression analyses. RESULTS CBB completion ranged from 82.0% to 91.5% across the four tasks and the odds of completing decreased with age. After adjusting for age, iPad/tablet familiarity increased the odds of completion for all tasks while level of education and employment increased the odds for some tasks only. These variables accounted for 18.0%-23.8% of the variance in reaction times on speeded tasks. Age and education had the most effect, although semipartial correlations were modest.

Results: A total of 1709 students participated in this study willingly from around Bangladesh. Among the respondents 45.1% were satisfied with online class. Though most of the students (45.8%) think online class in medical education is not effective like traditional lectures but many of them (47.4%) agrees to the point that online class should have complementary role in medical education. One of the strong attitude of medical students regarding web based learning revealed in this study that, most of them undoubtedly in unison (49.5% disagree, 30.3% strongly disagree) with that web based learning can never replace traditional lecture class in medical education. 77.2% students responded that web based learning is interactive. 54.9% students pointed out that they experienced interrupted internet connections with low internet speed during class time which is a barrier to WBL. 83.2% of the respondents complained about facing audio visual problem during online class which is attributed to the poor network connectivity. Most students in Bangladesh (74.8%) found online classes costly and 53.8% of the students needed technical supports for continued online class. Conclusion: This study finding can suggest a potential reform for medical education system of Bangladesh addressing the obstacles and expectations of students which can execute a fruitful web based learning in Bangladesh.","output":"Transition in Learning Approach for Undergraduate Medical Students of Bangladesh in Covid 19 Pandemic: A Situation Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During March to June 2021 India has experienced a deadly second wave of COVID19 with an increased number of post vaccination breakthrough infections reported across the country. To understand the possible reason of these breakthroughs we collected 677 clinical samples (throat swab/ nasal swabs) of individuals who had received two doses (n=592) and one dose (n=85) of vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin,) and tested positive for COVID19, from 17 states/Union Territories of country. These cases were telephonically interviewed and clinical data was analyzed. A total of 511 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were recovered with genome coverage of higher than 98% from both the cases. Analysis of both the cases determined that 86.69% (n=443) of them belonged to the Delta variant along with Alpha, Kappa, Delta AY.1 and Delta AY.2. The Delta variant clustered into 4 distinct sub-lineages. Sub-lineage I had mutations: ORF1ab, A1306S, P2046L, P2287S, V2930L, T3255I, T3446A, G5063S, P5401L, A6319V and N G215C; Sub lineage II : ORF1ab P309, A3209V, V3718A, G5063S, P5401L and ORF7a L116F; Sub lineage III : ORF1ab A3209V, V3718A, T3750I, G5063S, P5401L and Spike A222V; Sub-lineage IV ORF1ab P309L, D2980N, F3138S and spike K77T. This study indicated that majority of the clinical cases in the breakthrough were infected with the Delta variant and only 9.8% cases required hospitalization while fatality was observed in only 0.4% cases.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2), a rapid multiplex PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) that were obtained from patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine were used in this study. When the NPS samples were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 after treatment, they were used as negative samples. We evaluated the performance of the QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 comparing SARS-CoV-2 detection with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan-recommended real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method (NIID-RT-PCR). RESULTS: In total, 45 NPS samples were analyzed. The proportion of overall agreement between QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 and NIID-RT-PCR on 45 samples was 91.0% with a sensitivity of 84.0% (21/25), specificity at 100% (20/20), negative predictive value at 83.3% (20/24), and positive predictive value at 100% (21/21). There were no patients with co-infections with pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 showed a high agreement in comparison with the NIID-RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether and how the government response affected the transmission scale of COVID-19 on the dynamic perspective. METHODOLOGY: This paper uses a dynamic generalized moment method to research the relationship between the government response and COVID-19 case fatality rate by using panel data from eight countries: China, United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, France, Japan, and South Korea. FINDINGS: We have the following findings: 1. Government responses have a significant impact on the scale of COVID-19 transmission. 2. The rate of increase of government responses on the growth rate of COVID-19 case fatality rate has the characteristics of cyclicity and repeatability, that is, with the increase in the growth rate of government responses, the COVID-19 case fatality rate shows the following cyclical motion law: increasing first, reaching the maximum point, and then declining, and finally reaching the minimum point and then rising; ultimately, its convergence becomes 0. The cyclical fluctuations of COVID-19 in the long term may be caused by the decline in the level of government response, the mutation of the virus, and the violation of restrictive policies by some citizens. 3. The government response has a lag in controlling the spread of COVID-19. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Since there is a lack of literature on the impact of government responses on the development of COVID-19 from a long-term and dynamic perspective. This paper fills this gap in empirical research. We provide and expand new empirical evidence based on the current literature. This paper provides the basis for government decision-making and will help to formulate the response to other major public health events that may occur in the future.","output":"The impact of the government response on pandemic control in the long runA dynamic empirical analysis based on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions. Although generally safe and well tolerated they are potentially lethal in overdose. These two drugs are now candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID19. In vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses will be needed if they are to be of benefit, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Nevertheless they are already being used very widely and fatal accidental overdoses have been reported. Methods: Individual data from prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses and were managed in the national toxicology intensive care unit in Paris were pooled. Bayesian logistic regression was used to estimate a concentration-fatality curve. The probabilities of fatal iatrogenic toxicity with the chloroquine regimens currently being trialled for the treatment of COVID19 were estimated from a combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Findings: In total, 258 patients were studied of whom 26 died (10%). There was a steep sigmoid relationship between admission whole blood chloroquine concentrations and death. Concentrations above 13umol/L (95% credible interval (C.I.), 10 to 16) were associated with greater than 1% mortality. Based on peak concentrations, absolute fatality ratios in the high dose arm (chloroquine base equivalent adult dose of 600mg given twice daily for ten days) of a recently terminated trial were estimated between 0.06% (90kg adult, 95%C.I. 0 to 0.3%) and 4.8% (40kg adult, 95% C.I. 1.9 to 9.7%). This regimen results in peak concentrations above 10umol/L in more than 60% of adults weighing 70kg. The other high dose regimens trialled currently for COVID19 result in peak concentrations above 10umol/L in only 0.2% of adults weighting 70kg. Interpretation:} High-dose chloroquine treatment regimens which result in whole blood chloroquine concentrations below 10umol/L for the majority of patients should not result in life-threatening cardiovascular toxicity.","output":"Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a stress-induced cardiomyopathy triggered by critical illness including severe neurological disorders.

Unexplored, however, is how sex and race interact in COVID-19 outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Use available data to characterize COVID-19 mortality rates within and between race and sex strata in two US states, with the aim of understanding how apparent sex disparities in COVID-19 deaths vary across race. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational study uses COVID-19 mortality data through September 21, 2020, from Georgia (GA) and Michigan (MI). MAIN MEASURES: We calculate age-specific rates for each sex-race-age stratum, and age-standardized rates for each race-sex stratum. We investigate the sex disparity within race groups and the race disparity within sex groups using age-standardized rate ratios, and rate differences. KEY RESULTS: Within race groups, men have a higher COVID-19 mortality rate than women. Black men have the highest rate of all race-sex groups (in MI: 254.6, deaths per 100,000, 95% CI: 241.1-268.2, in GA:128.5, 95% CI: 121.0-135.9). In MI, the COVID-19 mortality rate for Black women (147.1, 95% CI: 138.7-155.4) is higher than the rate for white men (39.1, 95% CI: 37.3-40.9), white women (29.7, 95% CI: 28.3-31.0), and Asian/Pacific Islander men and women. COVID-19 mortality rates in GA followed the same pattern. In MI, the male:female mortality rate ratio among Black individuals is 1.7 (1.5-2.0) while the rate ratio among White individuals is only 1.3 (1.2-1.5). CONCLUSION: While overall, men have higher COVID-19 mortality rates than women, our findings show that this sex disparity does not hold across racial groups.

METHODS: Overall, 14 relevant papers in related interdisciplinary fields were reviewed to select the most useful literacy dimensions. From these articles, we extracted the most common dimensions used to measure e-health literacy across the disciplines. Multiple workshops with multidisciplinary team members reviewed and evaluated items for SeHL.

METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted in children aged 0C10 years and their parents through the TARGet Kids! COVID-19 Study in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada (AprilCJuly 2020). This study included 335 parents (2108 observations) and 416 children (2632 observations). Parents completed weekly questionnaires on health, family functioning, socio-demographics, and public health practices. The outcome was adherence to public health preventive measures measured separately for parents and children. Marginal log-binomial models were fitted using repeated measures of the outcome and predictors. RESULTS: Unemployment (RR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.97), apartment living (RR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.99), and essential worker in the household (RR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.00) were associated with decreased likelihood of adherence among parents; however, no associations were observed for other SDOH, including family income and ethnicity. Furthermore, there was no strong evidence that SDOH were associated with child adherence. The mean number of days/week that parents and children adhered at the start of the study was 6.45 (SD = 0.93) and 6.59 (SD = 0.86), respectively, and this decreased to 5.80 (SD = 1.12) and 5.84 (SD = 1.23) by study end.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Duzce State Hospital, Duzce, Turkey, between November 2018 and September 2019. METHODOLOGY: A total of 58 patients with diabetic foot ulcers that were treated at the study place were enrolled. The lesions were graded with Wagner Classification System. EGF (75 microg of Heberprot-P) vials were stored at +4C and cold-chain requirements were followed. EGF 5 mL was dissolved with 0.09% saline solution; and 0.5-1 ml of the solution was injected into the tissues and edge of the lesions regularly. The data was evaluated at the end of two years of the treatment period. The primary objective was wound healing, formation of granulation tissue; and the secondary objective was the prevention of lower extremity amputation. RESULTS: Diabetic foot ulcers wound healing was achieved in 93.1% (n=54) of patients with the formation of granulation tissue. The complete recovery was observed in 94.1% (n=32) of the patients who had Grade III and IV lesions. Lower extremity amputation was performed in two (3.4%) subjects. The lesions of two patients required flap surgery. The most common adverse events were tremor and syncope. CONCLUSION: Recombinant epidermal growth factor is highly effective for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and prevention of extremity amputation.

The practice of wearing face masks for prevention of transmission of airborne infections may disrupt ones ability to evaluate facial attractiveness, and with it, cues to an individual's health and genetic condition. The current research investigated the effect of face masks on the perception of face attractiveness. Across four studies, we tested if below- and above-average attractive full faces are equally affected by wearing facial masks. The results reveal that for young faces (Study 1) and old faces (Study 2) a facial mask increases the perceived attractiveness of relatively unattractive faces, but there is no effect of wearing a face mask for highly attractive faces. Study 3 shows that the same pattern of ratings emerged when the bottom-half of the faces are cropped rather than masked, indicating that the effect is not mask-specific. Our final Study 4, in which information from only the lower half of the faces was made available, showed that contrary to our previous findings, highly attractive half-faces are perceived to be less attractive than their full-face counterpart;but there is no such effect for the less attractive faces. This demonstrates the importance of the eye-region in the perception of attractiveness, especially for highly attractive faces. Collectively these findings suggest that a positivity-bias enhances the perception of unattractive faces when only the upper face is visible, a finding that may not extend to attractive faces because of the perceptual weight placed on their eye-region.

SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, its RNA polymerase, shares homology in the nucleotide uptake channel with the HCV orthologue enzyme NS5B. Besides, HCV enzyme NS5A has pleiotropic activities, such as RNA binding, that are shared with various SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Thus, anti-HCV NS5B and NS5A inhibitors, like sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, respectively, could be endowed with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, HuH-7 cells, Calu-3 cells, neural stem cells and monocytes were used to investigate the effects of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. In silico and cell-free based assays were performed with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nsp12 to better comprehend the mechanism of inhibition of the investigated compounds. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was generated to estimate daclatasvirs dose and schedule to maximize the probability of success for COVID-19. RESULTS: Daclatasvir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero, HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells, with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 M, respectively. Although less potent than daclatasvir, sofosbuvir alone and combined with daclatasvir inhibited replication in Calu-3 cells. Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release of cytokine storm-related inflammatory mediators, respectively. Sofosbuvir inhibited RNA synthesis by chain termination and daclatasvir targeted the folding of secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Concentrations required for partial daclatasvir in vitro activity are achieved in plasma at C(max) after administration of the approved dose to humans. CONCLUSIONS: Daclatasvir, alone or in combination with sofosbuvir, at higher doses than used against HCV, may be further fostered as an anti-COVID-19 therapy.","output":"In vitro antiviral activity of the anti-HCV drugs daclatasvir and sofosbuvir against SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Signaling pathway alterations in COVID-19 of living humans as well as therapeutic targets of the host proteins are not clear. We analyzed 317 urine proteomes, including 86 COVID-19, 55 pneumonia and 176 healthy controls, and identified specific RNA virus detector protein DDX58/RIG-I only in COVID-19 samples. Comparison of the COVID-19 urinary proteomes with controls revealed major pathway alterations in immunity, metabolism and protein localization. Biomarkers that may stratify severe symptoms from moderate ones suggested that macrophage induced inflammation and thrombolysis may play a critical role in worsening the disease. Hyper activation of the TCA cycle is evident and a macrophage enriched enzyme CLYBL is up regulated in COVID-19 patients. As CLYBL converts the immune modulatory TCA cycle metabolite itaconate through the citramalyl-CoA intermediate to acetyl-CoA, an increase in CLYBL may lead to the depletion of itaconate, limiting its anti-inflammatory function. These observations suggest that supplementation of itaconate and inhibition of CLYBL are possible therapeutic options for treating COVID-19, opening an avenue of modulating host defense as a means of combating SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

An online questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), was submitted to Italian dental patients with items about their perceived risks when going to the dentist, concerns about continuing orthodontic treatment, and the onset of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Data were analyzed with a chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1566 subjects completed the survey, including 486 who were under orthodontic treatment or who had a child in orthodontic treatment. A total of 866 participants (55.3%) thought the risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection was higher in a dental practice; this perception was associated with gender (women more than man), age (over 60 years old) and high levels of distress (P<0.001).

A 67-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CPFE presented with fever and dyspnea and was diagnosed with COVID-19. Upon admission, his respiratory failure was managed using high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy; however, despite treatment with remdesivir and systemic steroids, his respiratory failure continued to worsen. Therefore, baricitinib was administered from the ninth day of hospitalization for 14 days. Furthermore, his blood interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels showed an increase until day 13. Thus, tocilizumab was administered on the 13th day, which led to symptomatic improvement by day 18. The patient was discharged from our hospital on day 42.

METHODS NanoZolid-formulated EGF protein labelled with a near infrared dye (EGF-NIR) depots or EGF-NIR dissolved in PBS were injected subcutaneously into mice bearing EGF receptor (EGFR) positive human A549 lung cancer tumors inoculated subcutaneously. The release and biodistribution of the EGF-NIR were investigated in vivo longitudinally up to 96 hours post administration, utilizing whole body fluorescence imaging. In order to confirm the in vivo findings, histological analysis of tumor cryosections was performed to investigate EGF-NIR fluorescent signal and EGFR expression level by immunofluorescence labelling. RESULTS The in vivo fluorescence imaging showed a controlled release profile of the EGF-NIR loaded in the NanoZolid depots compared to free EGF-NIR. Histological analysis of the tumors further demonstrated a prevailing distribution of EGF-NIR in regions with high levels of EGFR expression.

Sheep generate important cardiovascular research models and the use of COLD has become more popular in experimental settings. METHODS Ultrasonic transit-time perivascular flow probes were surgically implanted on the pulmonary artery of 13 sheep. Paired COLD readings were taken at six time points, before and after implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and compared with COUFP recorded just after lithium injection. RESULTS The mean COLD was 5.7 litre min(-1) (range 3.8-9.6 litre min(-1)) and mean COUFP 5.9 litre min(-1) (range 4.0-9.2 litre min(-1)). The bias (standard deviation) was 0.3 (1.0) litre min(-1) [5.1 (16.9)%] and limits of agreement (LOA) were -1.7 to 2.3 litre min(-1) (-28.8 to 39.0%) with a percentage error (PE) of 34.4%.

In combination with physical distancing, hygiene protocols, and vaccines, quarantine and self\\\\isolation are primary means of viral containment. However, individuals with SPMI may experience more difficulties with mandated quarantine or self\\\\isolation because of their illness(es), stigma, and marginalization. To date, there is a lack of consensus on strategies that could aid such individuals in completing isolation. AIM: This review aimed to synthesize evidence for interventions to support self\\\\isolation and mandated quarantine for COVID\\\\19 among individuals with SPMIs. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA guidelines, searching 19 electronic databases (9 published literature registries and 10 gray literature sources). We looked for relevant randomized controlled trials, quasi\\\\experimental studies, and program evaluations of the effectiveness of relevant psychosocial, pharmacological, harm reduction, and addiction management strategies to support isolation settings or quarantine requirements for individuals with any SPMI (e.g., any mental disorder, substance use disorder, or their combination). FINDINGS: Of 10,298 total records that were located, 5582 were duplicate citations. Upon screening the remaining 4716 unique records by title and abstract, we excluded a further 3562 records. Only one original article met our inclusion criteria after reviewing the full texts of the remaining 1154 citations. To support individuals experiencing homelessness during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, San Francisco developed an isolation hotel that reduced COVID\\\\19 hospital strain for 1009 participants (25% had a mental health disorder and 26% had a substance use disorder). While 81% completed their hotel stay, 48 patients had behavioral health needs that exceeded the hotel's capabilities. No other studies met our review's eligibility criteria. Most articles located by the search simply proposed solutions or discussed the challenges brought by COVID\\\\19 for people with SPMIs. While some documents went a step further (e.g., shelter guidance documents to support individuals experiencing homelessness), these rarely addressed individuals with SPMIs directly. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review evaluated evidence from published and gray literature on interventions to support self\\\\isolation and mandated COVID\\\\19 quarantine for individuals with SPMIs. Only one study met our inclusion criteria. This study found a beneficial effect of a dedicated isolation hotel for individuals experiencing homelessness and COVID\\\\19where approximately 25%C50% of the study sample had a mental or substance use disorder. While there has been an abundance of COVID\\\\19 protocols in general, information for SPMIs is lacking.

Early recurrence, defined as tumor recurrence within 6 months of curative surgery, is associated with poor survival, requiring earlier detection and intervention. This study aimed to develop and validate a bedside model based on clinical parameters to predict early recurrence in CRLM patients and provide insight into post-operative surveillance strategies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 202 consecutive CRLM patients undergoing curative surgeries between 2012 and 2019 were retrospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to the training (n = 150) and validation (n = 52) sets. Baseline information and radiological, pathological, and laboratory findings were extracted from medical records. Predictive factors for early recurrence were identified via a multivariate logistic-regression model to develop a predictive nomogram, which was validated for discrimination, calibration, and clinical application. RESULTS: Liver-metastases number, lymph-node suspicion, neurovascular invasion, colon/rectum location, albumin and post-operative carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19C9 levels (CA19C9) were independent predictive factors and were used to construct the nomogram for early recurrence after curative surgery. The area under the curve was 0.866 and 0.792 for internal and external validation, respectively. The model significantly outperformed the clinical risk score and Beppus model in our data set. In the lift curve, the nomogram boosted the detection rate in post-operative surveillance by two-fold in the top 30% high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Our model for early recurrence in CRLM patients after curative surgeries showed superior performance and could aid in the decision-making for selective follow-up strategies.","output":"A predictive model for early recurrence of colorectal-cancer liver metastases based on clinical parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody-based fusion molecules have now come of age as therapeutics.

METHODS: A questionnaire-based online survey was conducted in early 2021 at the Hannover Medical School, supported by the German Society of Rheumatology. Target groups were all rheumatology physicians and residents in Germany. The main areas of investigation included work hours, task delegation, and collaboration; workload and mental health issues; discrimination and sexual harassment experiences; and the impact of COVID-19. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed for the standardized items and qualitative content analysis for the free-text information. RESULTS: The respondents (n = 101) expressed positive attitudes towards cooperation and task delegation to medical assistants, especially those specialized in rheumatology, while attitudes towards cooperation with GPs pointed to blockades. There was a strong mismatch between actual and desired work hours both in the group of women and in the group of men. 81% rated their workload as high or very high; every sixth rheumatologist has suffered from stress or burnout syndromes at least once in the past. Experiences of gender discrimination and sexual harassment/violence were frequently reported, mostly by women.

Methods CPE were isolated from clinical specimens and screening swabs from intensive care patients with COVID-19 disease and from environmental screening. Whole genome sequencing analysis was instrumental in informing phylogenetic relationships. Results Seven clinical isolates and one environmental carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate - all carrying OXA-48, CTX-M-15 and outer membrane porin mutations in ompK35/ompK36 - were identified with 1 single nucleotide polymorphism difference, indicative of clonality. A bundle of infection control interventions including careful adherence with contact precautions and hand hygiene, twice weekly screening for multidrug-resistant organisms, strict antimicrobial stewardship and enhanced cleaning protocols promptly terminated the outbreak. Discussion Wards caring for COVID-19 patients, including intensive care units, have an important focus on preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to other patients and health care workers. Prolonged use of personal protective equipment is common with donning and doffing stations at the ward entrance, leaving health care workers prone to reduced hand hygiene practices between patients. Minimising transmission of other pathogens by careful adherence to normal contact precautions including hand hygiene, even during high patient contact manoeuvres, is critical to prevent outbreaks of multi-drug resistant organisms. Appropriate antimicrobial stewardship and screening for multi-drug resistant organisms must also be maintained throughout surge periods to prevent medium-term escalation in antimicrobial resistance rates.

Although meat means an important source of nutrients, it is also evident that a great consumption of this source of proteins has also a negative environmental impact. Livestock production does not only have a negative influence on GHG emissions, but also on the water footprint, water pollution, and water scarcity. With respect to human health, in 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) stated that red meat was a probable carcinogen to humans (Group 2A), while consumption of processed meat was carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). Most environmental contaminants (PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs, PCNs, etc.) that are frequently found in meats are highly soluble in fats. Therefore, avoiding ingesting fats from red meats and meat products, doubtless would help in the prevention, not only of the well-known cardiovascular diseases derived of fats consumption, but also of certain kinds of cancers, mainly colorectal cancer. On the other hand, consumption of meat - especially wild meat - is related to virus infections, as many viruses have been found in wild meat trade markets. Based on the scientific literature here reviewed, we have noted that the results of the investigations conducted after the statement of the IARC, have corroborated the recommendation of reducing significantly the consumption of red meats and meat products. In turn, the reduction of meat consumption should contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and their considerable impact on global warming and climate change.

METHOD AND MATERIALS Nine periodontally healthy nonsmoking patients (seven women, 37.5  7.36 years old) with a total of 41 adjacent RT I (n = 23) and RT II (n = 18) gingival recessions exhibiting a minimum depth of 2 mm were treated by means of MCAT+PADM. Recession depth and width, width of attached and keratinized tissue, probing depths, and clinical attachment level were measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 years postsurgically. The primary outcome variable was complete root coverage (ie 100% root coverage), while secondary outcomes were mean root coverage and increase in keratinized tissue and attached gingiva widths. RESULTS At 1 and 4 years, statistically highly significant (P < .001) root coverage was obtained in all nine patients compared to baseline. Mean root coverage decreased in these nine patients from 72.05  30.18% at 1 year to 56.79  27.53% at 4 years. Complete root coverage was obtained in 18 gingival recessions at 1 year (baseline RT: 12 RT I, 6 RT II) and in seven gingival recessions (5 RT I, 2 RT II) at 4 years. Most root coverage occurred in the first year postsurgically, showing a statistically significant decrease between the first and fourth year (P = .003). Mean width of attached gingiva increased statistically significantly (P < .05) from 2.85  1.08 mm to 3.14  1.08 mm at 1 year with a statistically significant decrease at 4 years. At 1 year, 78.05% of gingival recessions showed a root coverage > 50%, and 68.29% still exhibited a root coverage > 50% at 4 years. CONCLUSION The use of MCAT+PADM represents a valuable treatment option for multiple adjacent maxillary and mandibular RT I and II gingival recessions on a long-term basis.","output":"Long-term results after treatment of multiple adjacent gingival recessions with the modified coronally advanced tunnel and a porcine acellular dermal matrix."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to develop more inclusive and sustainable waste management practices to be implemented in Bang Chalong Housing, a model community with unsatisfactory waste separation and recycling rate.

DPT aims to notify app users about proximity exposures to persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 so that they can self-quarantine. The success of DPT apps depends on user acceptance and the embedding of DPT into the pandemic mitigation strategy. OBJECTIVE: By searching for media articles published during the first 3 months after DPT launch, the implementation of DPT in Switzerland was evaluated to inform similar undertakings in other countries. The second aim of the study was to create a link between reported DPT implementation challenges and normalization process theory for planning and optimizing complex digital health interventions, which can provide useful guidance for decision-making in DPT design and implementation. METHODS: A Swiss media database was searched for articles on the Swiss DPT app (SwissCovid) published in German or French between July 4 and October 3, 2020. In a structured process, topics were extracted and clustered manually from articles that were deemed pertinent. Extracted topics were mapped to four NPT constructs, which reflected the flow of intervention development from planning, stakeholder onboarding, and execution to critical appraisal. Coherence constructs describe sense-making by stakeholders, cognitive participation constructs reflect participants' efforts to create engagement with the intervention, collective actions refer to intervention execution and joint stakeholder efforts to make the intervention work, and reflexive monitoring refers to collective risk-benefit appraisals to create improvements. RESULTS: Out of 94 articles deemed pertinent and selected for closer inspection, 38 provided unique information on implementation challenges. Five challenge areas were identified: communication challenges, challenges for DPT to interface with other processes, fear of resource competition with established pandemic mitigation measures, unclear DPT effectiveness, and obstacles to greater user coverage and compliance. Specifically, several articles mentioned unclear DPT benefits to affect commitment and to raise fears among different health system actors regarding resource competition. Moreover, media reports indicated process interface challenges such as delays or unclear responsibilities in the notification cascade, as well as misunderstandings and unmet communication needs from health system actors. Finally, reports suggested misaligned incentives, not only for app usage by the public but also for process engagement by other actors in the app notification cascade. NPT provided a well-fitting framework to contextualize the different DPT implementation challenges and to highlight improvement strategies, namely a better alignment of stakeholder incentives, or stakeholder-specific communication to address their concerns about DPT. CONCLUSIONS: Early experiences from one of the first adopters of DPT indicate that nontechnical implementation challenges may affect the effectiveness of DPT. The NPT analysis provides a novel perspective on DPT implementation and stresses the need for stakeholder inclusion in development and operationalization.","output":"Challenges for Nontechnical Implementation of Digital Proximity Tracing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Media Analysis of the SwissCovid App"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Gastric diverticula are a rare condition characterized by a pouch protruding from the gastric wall.

Some studies have investigated the use of stem cells to treat SSc. Herein, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of SSc. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, OVID, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases were searched up to February 1, 2021. Literature screening, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two researchers in according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The discrepancies were resolved by a third researcher. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies encompassing 133 SSc patients were included in the study. Compared to the baseline after treatment with MSCs: 1. The modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) was significantly reduced in patients with SSc (P < 0.00001). 2. MSCs decreased the number of digital ulcer, mouth handicap scale, and visual analog scale of hand pain in SSc patients (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.03, respectively). 3. No statistical differences were detected in Raynaud's condition score and Cochin hand function scale score at 6 months of MSCs therapy (P = 0.5 and P = 0.62). 4. After 12 months of follow-up, MSCs improve carbon monoxide diffusing capacity and forced vital capacity of SSc patients (P < 0.05). 5. Overall, MSCs application was safe; a few cases exhibited swelling at the injection site, diarrhea and arthralgia, which had self-recovery, and no severe adverse events occurred in the included trials. CONCLUSIONS: MSC therapy improves the degree of skin thickening, lung function, and mouth opening and relieves finger ulcers and pain in patients with SSc without severe adverse events. Thus, MSCs or MSCs combined with plasma and traditional medicine might be an effective and promising treatment of SSc patients.

COVID-19 is a highly contagious and fatal disease. Almost everyone in the population is susceptible, and the incubation period is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days. The clinical symptoms of the COVID-19 are fever, dry cough and fatigue. Some patients are accompanied by symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea. Severe patients could even develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shocks, metabolic acidosis and multifunctional organ failure, etc. Due to the relatively closed environment of dental clinics and the unique nature of dental procedures, both dental personnel and patients are easy to get infection through currently known respiratory droplet transmission, aerosol transmission, close contact transmission and other ways, inducing mutual cross-infection. Dental practitioners are facing unprecedented challenges due to the high risk of exposure to droplets and aerosols from saliva and other body fluids during dental procedures. Based on our experience and relevant research, this article introduces the basic knowledge about COVID-19 and the corresponding protective measures for dental practitioners, includes the risk of infection during dental procedures, the precautions related to the patients, infection control measures during dental treatment in clinics, protection measures at different levels for dental practitioners, and emergency dental treatment for confirmed COVID-19.

This includes the identification of vulnerable patients who should \\"shield\\" in order to reduce the likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV2. We used national specialty guidance and an adapted screening tool to risk stratify patients identified from our prescribing and monitoring databases, and identify those needing to shield (score &#8805; 3) using information from departmental letters, online general practice records and recent laboratory investigations. We collated underlying rheumatological conditions and risk factors. Two months into the shielding process, we examined the COVID-19 status of these patients using hospital laboratory records and compared to population level data. Of 887 patients assessed, 248 (28%) scored &#8805; 3 and were sent a standard shielding letter. The most common risk factor in the shielding letter group was age &#8805; 70 years and/or presence of a listed co-morbidity (199 patients). The most common rheumatology conditions were rheumatoid arthritis (69.4%), polymyalgia rheumatica (8.5%) and giant cell arteritis (8.5%). Coronavirus incidence rates were similar in the shielding letter group (0.403%) and in the UK population (0.397%).

The trend towards lower incidence in this cohort could be because of prior education regarding general infection risk and response to public health messages. While risk stratification and shielding could be effective, prior education regarding general infection risk and public health messages to enhance health protection behaviours during a pandemic may have equal or more important roles. Key Points a? Patients on treatment for rheumatic disorders showed a trend for lower incidence of COVID-19 transmission irrespective of shielding letter status a?

This article explores qualitative data from patients and TC instructors on their attitudes, acceptability and engagement with the two modes of TC delivery. METHODS: Qualitative data from CF patients (>6 years) were collected using Skype interviews/focus groups and written feedback. TC instructors provided weekly written feedback, and took part in interviews/ focus groups at the end of the study. Patients and instructors interviews explored their experiences and engagement with TC online delivery and ability to practice. RESULTS: Irrespective of the type of TC delivery, all CF participants interviewed (n=28) practiced between lessons and most wanted to continue TC. Teenagers were more likely to miss TC appointments. Internet delivery was well received by both patients and TC instructors. Two patients reported difficulties with screen size/camera and one with internet connectivity.

This study discusses a collaborative private-public partnership (PPP), supply chain advisory committee (SCAC), established during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to acquire personal protective equipment (PPE) and other critical supplies for a donation center in Toledo, Ohio, USA. This center serves the community and small businesses. This paper discusses the strategies, process and framework that were created to procure the needed items under a short lead time. The process of the partnership and outcomes are transferable and capable of being used by others to benefit society. Design/methodology/approach: The case study methodology was used to investigate and summarize the actions and events of the SCAC. The case presented was tracked from the initial call to action from a local emergency response organization, Lucas County Emergency Operation Center (EOC), through the first six months of the committees work. Data collection was completed through a triangulation of sources. Findings: The findings of this study reveal that public firms are vulnerable in a crisis. A crisis exposes the inequities in the supply chain and the need for public and private collaboration to use innovative procurement strategies. This study suggests that PPP procurement professionals benefit from working together. Both can learn from the limitations and benefits of collaborating. Practical implications: This study offers a framework on how PPPs can be established to procure PPE during a crisis. This study has practical implications for private and public firms seeking to collaborate for the good of society. Social implications: The findings of the study reveal that public firms are vulnerable in a crisis, which exposes the inequities in their supply chains. Private-public partnership (PPP) procurement professionals mutually benefit from working together as both can learn from each whether it is procuring PPE during a crisis or seeking to team up for the good of society. Society benefits when these organizations share solutions to problems rather than compete against one another during a crisis-situation such as a global pandemic. Supplies get to those who need them the most and information flows amongst the organizations to ensure equity in the availability of the supplies. Originality/value: This study contributes to the growing body of literature that argues that public procurement must be innovative and strategic to contribute to socially responsible solutions. Government regulations require public procurement to use competitive bidding for accountability, cost reduction and to reduce fraud. However, emergency situations require innovative procurement strategies. The use of innovative procurement strategies is typical in private procurement. During a crisis, supplier relationships, lead-time management and shared and transfer of knowledge must be leveraged to acquire critical items in a timely manner. A lack of innovative public procurement strategies constrains the public and small under resourced businesses, rendering them inoperable. This paper provides a case study of an effective PPP during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We simulated SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing to estimate the frequency of testing needed to avert continued epidemic propagation as shelter-in-place orders are relaxed. We find that testing strategies less frequent than twice weekly (e.g. weekly testing or testing once prior to returning to work) are unlikely to prevent workforce outbreaks.

The implantation of a too-small stented pericardial valve, leading to an effective orifice area indexed to a body surface area less than 0.85 cm2/m2, is regarded as prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM). A PPM negatively affects the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and thus the normalization of left ventricular function and the alleviation of symptoms. Persistent left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In the case of predictable PPM, there are three options: 1) accept the PPM resulting from the implantation of a stented pericardial valve when comorbidities of the patient forbid the more technically demanding operative technique of implanting a larger prosthesis, 2) enlarge the aortic root to accommodate a larger stented valve substitute, or 3) implant a stentless biological valve or a homograft. Compared to classical aortic valve replacement with stented pericardial valves, the full-root implantation of stentless aortic xenografts offers the possibility of implanting a 3-4 mm larger valve in a given patient, thus allowing significant reduction in transvalvular gradients. However, a number of cardiac surgeons are reluctant to transform a classical aortic valve replacement with stented pericardial valves into the more technically challenging full-root implantation of stentless aortic xenografts. Given the potential hemodynamic advantages of stentless aortic xenografts, we have adopted full-root implantation to avoid PPM in patients with small aortic roots necessitating an aortic valve replacement.

We investigate the impact of different testing strategies on the SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in a primary school environment, using an individual-based modelling approach. Specifically, we consider three testing strategies: 1) symptomatic isolation, where we test symptomatic individuals and isolate them when they test positive, 2) reactive screening, where a class is screened once one symptomatic individual was identified, and 3) repetitive screening, where the school in its entirety is screened on regular time intervals. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that repetitive testing strategies can significantly reduce the attack rate in schools, contrary to a reactive screening approach. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of these testing strategies on the average number of school days lost per child.","output":"Controlling SARS-CoV-2 in schools using repetitive testing strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid introduction of new information and communication technologies into medical practice has prompted Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic SurgeryR to publish a position paper on sleep-disordered breathing, especially in relation to positive pressure treatment. It should be pointed out that the scientific literature is to some extent controversial due to a paucity of large randomized multicenter studies with long-term follow-up. Moreover, the telematics devices and systems on the market vary widely. As a result, the recommendations are based primarily on a consensus of expert professionals. Another very important aspect addressed extensively in this document is the obvious lack of regulations on legal matters and the operations of commercial companies. The most important recommendations included in this position paper are that telemedicine is primarily advocated in subjects with travel problems or who live far from the hospital, in patients with poor CPAP compliance, and in most cases treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation. A key element is patient individualization. It is imperative that the relevant technical, legal and ethical requirements (medical device regulations, data protection, and informed consent) are met.

The objective of the literature review was to study the research on patient satisfaction with remote healthcare services prior to and during the pandemic. The study featured a literature review of electronic databases, such as: Medline, ProQuest, PubMED, Ebsco, Google Scholar, WoS. The identified empirical papers were classified in two groups concerning the research on patient satisfaction prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and were divided and descriptively synthesised. Certain limitations to the methodical quality of the research were demonstrated as result of the conducted analyses.

Building on the theoretical frame of authoritarian environmentalism, it peruses fieldwork material collected during 2009C2019 to determine the most prominent features of recent collaborative governance efforts in the field of water management in Vietnam, a historically seasonal flooding-dependent country. A key feature is technocratisation, where top-down management structures and practices prioritise technocratic solutions to environmental challenges over deliberation, awareness raising, and integration of local knowledge. Another equally important feature is authoritarian intensification, by which increasingly complex environmental management functions, coupled with the states determination to retain political control, reinforce authoritarian governance. We jointly refer to these features as captured collaboration, signifying a strong authoritarian regime dominance in both vertical and horizontal relations of environmental governance. However, while captured collaboration still appears to be a defining collaborative characteristic, the article acknowledges rising calls for deliberative government in Vietnamese society. This is particularly outspoken in relation to the highly contested issues of hydropower construction and enhanced floods, debates that simultaneously have paved the way for a burgeoning, though much delayed, paradigm shift.","output":"Authoritarian EnvironmentalismCaptured Collaboration in Vietnamese Water Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adapting in-person learning activities such as labs for online courses presents many challenges for educators and is of particular interest during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indiscriminate suppression is unsustainable long term and presupposes that all interactions carry equal importance.

In this paper, we deploy simulations to understand and quantify the impact on disease transmission of a set of topological network features, building a dataset of 9000 interaction graphs using generators of different types of synthetic social networks. Independently of the topology of the network, we maintain constant the total volume of social interactions in our simulations, to show how even with the same social contact some network structures are more or less resilient to the spread. We find a suitable intervention to be specific suppression of unfamiliar and casual interactions that contribute to the networks global efficiency. This is, pathogen spread is significantly reduced by limiting specific kinds of contact rather than their global number.

With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreading around the world, this rapid review aims to answer that question and thus to promote evidence-based decision making in health education policy and practice. Methods: We systematically searched the literature on health education during COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics in Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data from their inception until March 31, 2020. The potential bias of the studies was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool. Results: Of 1,067 papers found, 24 cross-sectional studies with a total of 35,967 participants were included in this review. The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious diseases. Health information from nonprofit, government and academic websites was more accurate than privately owned commercial websites and media websites. Conclusions: For educating and cultivating children, parents should obtain information from the official websites of authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and national Centers for Disease Control, or from other sources endorsed by these authorities, rather than from a general search of the internet or social media.","output":"Public health education for parents during the outbreak of COVID-19: A rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) are two arthropod-borne phleboviruses in the Bunyaviridae family, which cause severe illness in humans and animals. Glycoprotein N (Gn) is one of the envelope proteins on the virus surface and is a major antigenic component. Despite its importance for virus entry and fusion, the molecular features of the phleboviruse Gn were unknown. Here, we present the crystal structures of the Gn head domain from both SFTSV and RVFV, which display a similar compact triangular shape overall, while the three subdomains (domains I, II, and III) making up the Gn head display different arrangements. Ten cysteines in the Gn stem region are conserved among phleboviruses, four of which are responsible for Gn dimerization, as revealed in this study, and they are highly conserved for all members in Bunyaviridae Therefore, we propose an anchoring mode on the viral surface. The complex structure of the SFTSV Gn head and human neutralizing antibody MAb 4-5 reveals that helices 6 in subdomain III is the key component for neutralization. Importantly, the structure indicates that domain III is an ideal region recognized by specific neutralizing antibodies, while domain II is probably recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, Gn is a desirable vaccine target, and our data provide a molecular basis for the rational design of vaccines against the diseases caused by phleboviruses and a model for bunyavirus Gn embedding on the viral surface.","output":"Structures of phlebovirus glycoprotein Gn and identification of a neutralizing antibody epitope."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To gain a better understanding of decisions around adherence to self-isolation advice during the first phase of the COVID-19 response in England. Design: A mixed-methods cross sectional study. Setting: England Participants COVID-19 cases and contacts who were contacted by Public Health England (PHE) during the first phase of the response in England (January-March 2020). Results: Of 250 respondents who were advised to self-isolate, 63% reported not leaving home at all during their isolation period, 20% reported leaving only for lower risk activities (dog walking or exercise) and 16% reported leaving for potentially higher risk, reasons (shopping, medical appointments, childcare, meeting family or friends). Factors associated with adherence to never going out included: the belief that following isolation advice would save lives, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, being advised to stay in their room (rather than just inside), having help from outside and having regular contact by text message from PHE. Factors associated with non-adherence included being angry about the advice to isolate, being unable to get groceries delivered and concerns about losing touch with friends and family. Interviews highlighted that a sense of duty motivated people to adhere to isolation guidance and where people did leave their homes, these decisions were based on rational calculations of the risk of transmission; people would only leave their homes when they thought they were unlikely to come into contact with others. Conclusions: Measures of adherence should be nuanced to allow for the adaptations people make to their behaviour during isolation.

Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional, mortality and seroprevalence survey was conducted in Omdurman, Sudan, from March 1, until April 10 2021. A two-stage cluster sampling method was used to investigate the death rate for the pre-pandemic (January 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1, 2020 - day of the survey) period using questionnaires. The seroprevalence survey was performed in a subset of households and all consenting members were tested with a rapid serological test (SD-Biosensor) and a subgroup additionally with ELISA (EUROIMMUN). Fisher's exact test was used to assess differences between the pre-and pandemic periods and a random effect and Bayesian latent class model to adjust for test performance. Findings Data from 27315 people (3716 households) for the entire recall period showed a 67% (95% CI 32-110) increase in death rate between the pre-pandemic (0.12 deaths/10000 people/day [95% CI 0.10-0.14]) and pandemic (0.20 [0.16-0.23]) periods.

Data on how sleep and daytime socioemotional functioning may be bidirectionally related to one another in the midst of an ongoing stressor are limited, particularly during adolescence, a developmental period when risk for the onset of mental health difficulties and sleep disturbances is high. METHODS Participants (N = 459, ages of 13-18 years) were recruited from across the United States and completed an intake survey and one week of daily reports beginning 2 weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency. Participants reported on their daily post-traumatic stress symptoms, positive and negative affect, loneliness, sleep onset difficulties, nightmares, sleep quality, and time in bed. RESULTS Lagged hierarchical linear models adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, medication use, medical conditions, and ongoing stressors were estimated to examine bidirectional associations between night-time sleep and next-day mental health. Poorer sleep quality and more nightmares at night predicted higher next-day negative affect, and greater daytime negative affect predicted lower sleep quality and a greater likelihood of having nightmares the following night. Poor sleep quality predicted greater next-day post-traumatic stress, which, in turn, predicted poorer sleep quality the following night and more difficulties falling asleep. Poor sleep quality and a longer time in bed also predicted greater next-day loneliness.

We characterize the emulsions by using optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and laser particle analysis, explore their rheological behavior through large-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments, and analyze the nonlinear viscoelasticities through Fourier transform (FT)-rheology and Lissajous-Bowditch plots. There is a great difference between GA and MC in the viscosity effect and the arrangement around emulsion droplets. GA is not an effective flocculation inhibitor due to a bridging flocculation mechanism rather than a direct viscosity effect.

These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020. RESULTS: Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged. Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P< 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P< 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death.

BACKGROUND: Lombardy was the Italian region with the highest coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) prevalence, at the end of March 2020 accounting for 20% of all worldwide deaths. Joint Gastro-Intestinal societies released recommendations for Endoscopy Units to reduce the risk of the contagion. However, there are few data from high-prevalence areas on adherence to these recommendations and on their efficacy. METHODS: A survey was designed by the Lombardy section of SIED to analyze (a) changes in activity and organization, (b) adherence to recommendations, (c) rate of health care professionals' (HCP) infection during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: In total, 35/61 invited centers (57.4%) participated; most modified activities were according to recommendations and had filtering face piece 2/filtering face piece 3 and water-repellent gowns available, but few had negative-pressure rooms or provided telephonic follow-up; 15% of HCPs called in sick and 6% had confirmed COVID-19. There was a trend (P=0.07) toward different confirmed COVID-19 rates among endoscopists (7.9%), nurses (6.6%), intermediate-care technicians (3.4%), and administrative personnel (2.2%). There was no correlation between the rate of sick HCPs and COVID-19 incidence in the provinces and personal protective equipment availability and use, whereas an inverse correlation with hospital volume was found. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to recommendations was rather good, though a minority were able to follow all recommendations. Confirmed COVID-19 seemed higher among endoscopists and nurses, suggesting that activities in the endoscopy rooms are at considerable viral spread risk.","output":"Infection Control Practices and Outcomes of Endoscopy Units in the Lombardy Region of Italy: A Survey From the Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy During COVID-19 Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Adult scoliosis (AS) is the most common spine deformity in adults. Back pain is the main symptom leading patients to seek medical consultation. Stabilization exercise has been shown effective for reducing back pain. No literature review has examined the effects of such exercises in adults with scoliosis. The objective was to systematically review the effects of stabilization exercises on back pain, disability and quality of life in adults with scoliosis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We systematically searched the following databases from inception to March 2017: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, SportDiscus and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. Selection criteria included: controlled clinical trials that compare core stabilization exercise to placebo, no treatment or another treatment in participants diagnosed with AS over 18 years old. Studies with participants presenting torso or lower extremity surgery, injection in the last six months, comorbidity that could affect the spine, red flags signs or with a history of spine trauma were excluded. We extracted information about participants, treatments, and results on pain, function and quality of life. We appraised quality using Cochrane risk of bias. We formulated level of evidence summary statements using a priori rules based on quality and consistency of results. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS We found 630 unique articles and screened the full-text of 98 articles retrieved. Only one article met all selection criteria and was included in this review. Studies were mainly excluded for study design and patient population. The included study presented a low risk of bias for all criteria except for blinding and reporting if the timing of assessments was similar between groups. The literature provides limited evidence from one study with high risk of bias that stabilization exercises in the form of 20 weeks of active self-correction, task-oriented exercises and cognitive-behavioral therapy significantly improves pain, disability and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Despite the high prevalence of AS, there is an important gap in the literature with limited evidence reporting the effect of exercise on back pain in adults with scoliosis. This review suggest further experimental research is needed and formulates research recommendations.","output":"Effect of stabilization exercise on back pain, disability and quality of life in adults with scoliosis: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: : To update our previously reported systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies on cardiovascular drug exposure and COVID-19 clinical outcomes by focusing on newly published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: More than 500 databases were searched between 1-Nov-2020 and 2-Oct-2021 to identify RCTs that were published after our baseline review. One reviewer extracted data with other reviewers verifying the extracted data for accuracy and completeness. Results: After screening 22,414 records, we included 24 and 21 RCTs in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses, respectively. The most investigated drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) and anticoagulants, investigated by 10 and 11 studies respectively. In meta-analyses, ACEI/ARBs did not affect hospitalization length (mean difference/MD -0.42, 95% CI -1.83;0.98 days, n=1183), COVID-19 severity (risk ratio/RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.71;1.15, n=1661) and mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.58;1.47, n=1646). Therapeutic anticoagulation also had no effect (hospitalization length MD -0.29, 95% CI -1.13 to 0.56 days, n=1449;severity RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70;1.04, n=2696;and, mortality RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77;1.13, n=5689). Other investigated drug classes were antiplatelets (aspirin, 2 trials), antithrombotics (sulodexide, 1 trial), calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, 1 trial) and lipid modifying drugs (atorvastatin, 1 trial). Conclusion: Moderate- to high-certainty RCT evidence suggests that cardiovascular drugs such as ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes, and should therefore not be discontinued. These cardiovascular drugs should also not be initiated to treat or prevent COVID-19 unless they are needed for an underlying currently approved therapeutic indication.","output":"Cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A wide range of mortality rates has been reported in COVID-19 patients on the intensive care unit. We wanted to describe the clinical course and determine the mortality rate in our institutions intensive care units. METHODS: To this end, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 50 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at a large German tertiary university hospital. Clinical features are reported with a focus on ICU interventions, such as mechanical ventilation, prone positioning and extracorporeal organ support. Outcome is presented using a 7-point ordinal scale on day 28 and 60 following ICU admission. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years, 78% were male. LDH and D-Dimers were elevated, and patients were low on Vitamin D. ARDS incidence was 75%, and 43/50 patients needed invasive ventilation. 22/50 patients intermittently needed prone positioning, and 7/50 required ECMO. The interval from onset of the first symptoms to admission to the hospital and to the ICU was shorter in non-survivors than in survivors. By day 60 after ICU admission, 52% of the patients had been discharged. 60-day mortality rate was 32%; 37% for ventilated patients, and 42% for those requiring both: ventilation and renal replacement therapy.

High speed machining can excite the higher frequency modes and in addition, run-out is also amplified. These effects in high speed micromachining induces the uncertainty in cutting forces. The estimation of cutting coefficients without inclusion of uncertainty cannot give accurate values and hence, the predicted cutting force and machining stability using these cutting coefficient may not be accurate. In the present work, cutting coefficients have been determined using the Bayesian inference which includes the uncertainty in estimated cutting coefficients. Note that, estimated cutting coefficient independent of chip load and cutting velocity does not include the high speed micromachining mechanics like size effect. The cutting coefficients have been estimated as a function of cutting velocity and chip load in the present work. The segmented cutting coefficients for different ranges of cutting speed varying from 10000 rpm to 110000 rpm has been obtained as a non-liner function of chip load. Bayesian inference modelling for cutting coefficients has been carried out using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The convergence of prior and posterior distribution has been verified using correlation and trace of samples used for sampling. The posterior distribution shows that there is a good fitting, which accurately predicts the mean of the cutting coefficients. Finally, predicted cutting coefficients have been compared with cutting coefficients obtained from the deterministic approach using least square method. The experimentally estimated cutting coefficients are found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting coefficients with Bayesian inference approach. The predicted cutting coefficients using Bayesian inference shows the deviation of 0.89% and 8.4% at 40000 rpm from experimentally obtained cutting coefficients for tangential and radial cutting coefficients, respectively. The experimental cutting force is found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting force with Bayesian inference based cutting coefficients fitting at 105000 rpm.","output":"Process Mechanics Based Uncertainty Modeling for Cutting Force Prediction in High Speed Micromilling of Ti6Al4V"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in different countries in a short time while and the significant economic damage caused by it were important reasons for conducting long-term monitoring studies in Ukraine PED monitoring researches conduct carry out during 2014-2018 using RT-PCR and ELISA showed the presence of infection in 14 (66 67%) of 21 examined regions of Ukraine For the period 2014- 2018, the proportion of PED cases rate was the lowest in 2017 (1 76%) and the highest in 2016 (48 03%) Over the entire period, the percentage seropositive animals progressively decreased to a seronegative status indicator defined in sows in 2018 The results of determination of the virulence of 40 strains of PED virus from different regions of Ukraine using the RT-PCR method proved the circulation of highly virulent strains The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the endemic strain of PED virus is included in the cluster of North American strains and the Chinese strains Important is the fact that it is not included in the group of European low-virulent S-INDEL strains Thus, the obtained data indicate a high probability that the PED virus was introduced into Ukraine from the territory of the Asian continent or the United States of America - (a high probability that the PED virus was translocated from the territory of the Asian continent or the United States of America into Ukraine)","output":"The monitoring and molecular epizootiology of porcine epidemic diarrhea in Ukraine during 2014-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: As COVID-19 transmission continues despite vaccination programs, healthcare workers (HCWs) face an ongoing pandemic response.

(2) Methods: Qualitative e-diary entries were shared by HCWs during the early phases of the outbreak in Singapore from June to August 2020. Data were collected via an online survey of n = 3616 HCWs of all cadres. Nine institutionsrestructured hospitals (n = 5), affiliated primary partners (n = 2) and hospices (n = 2)participated. Applied thematic analysis was undertaken and organized according to Heartware and Hardware. Major themes are in italics (3) Results: n = 663 (18%) HCWs submitted a qualitative entry. Dominant themes undermining (1) Heartware consisted of burnout from being overworked and emotional exhaustion and at times feeling a lack of appreciation or support at work. The most common themes overriding morale breakers were a stoic acceptance to fight, adjust and hold the line, coupled with motivation from engaging leadership and supportive colleagues. The biggest barrier in (2) Hardware analysis related to sub-optimal segregation strategies within wards and designing better protocols for case detection, triage, and admissions criteria. Overall, the most cited enabler was the timely and well-planned provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for front-liners, though scope for scale-up was called for by those not considered frontline. Analysis maps internal organizational functioning to wider external public and policy-related narratives. (4) Conclusions: COVID-19 surges are becoming endemic rather than exceptional events. System elasticity needs to build on known pillars coupling improving safety and care delivery with improving HCW morale. Accordingly, a model capturing such facets of Adaptive Pandemic Response derived from our data analyses is described.

We performed a comparative evaluation of two SARS vaccines for their ability to protect against live SARS-CoV intranasal challenge in ferrets. Both the whole killed SARS-CoV vaccine (with and without alum) and adenovirus-based vectors encoding the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein induced neutralizing antibody responses and reduced viral replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract and progression of virus to the lower respiratory tract. The vaccines also diminished haemorrhage in the thymus and reduced the severity and extent of pneumonia and damage to lung epithelium. However, despite high neutralizing antibody titres, protection was incomplete for all vaccine preparations and administration routes. Our data suggest that a combination of vaccine strategies may be required for effective protection from this pathogen. The ferret may be a good model for SARS-CoV infection because it is the only model that replicates the fever seen in human patients, as well as replicating other SARS disease features including infection by the respiratory route, clinical signs, viral replication in upper and lower respiratory tract and lung damage.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine efficacy in ferrets: whole killed virus and adenovirus-vectored vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article critically examines how solidarity has been enacted in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly, but not exclusively, from a United Kingdom perspective.(1) Solidaristic strategies are framed in two ways: aspirations to overcome COVID-19 (utopian anthropocentric solidarity); and those that are illusory, incompatible, contradictory, and disrupting of solidaristic ideals (heterotopian solidarity).

In addition, non-falciparum species including vivax and knowlesi cause significant morbidity and mortality. Vascular dysfunction is a key feature in malaria pathogenesis leading to impaired blood perfusion, vascular obstruction, and tissue hypoxia. Contributing factors include adhesion of infected RBC to endothelium, endothelial activation, and reduced nitric oxide formation. Endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) protects the vasculature by maintaining vessel integrity and regulating cellular adhesion and nitric oxide signaling pathways. Breakdown of eGC is known to occur in infectious diseases such as bacterial sepsis and dengue and is associated with adverse outcomes. Emerging studies using biochemical markers and in vivo imaging suggest that eGC breakdown occurs during Plasmodium infection and is associated with markers of malaria disease severity, endothelial activation, and vascular function. In this review, we describe characteristics of eGC breakdown in malaria and discuss how these relate to vascular dysfunction and adverse outcomes. Further understanding of this process may lead to adjunctive therapy to preserve or restore damaged eGC and reduce microvascular dysfunction and the morbidity/mortality of malaria.","output":"Vascular Dysfunction in Malaria: Understanding the Role of the Endothelial Glycocalyx"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of chloroprocaine for activating labor analgesia and the optimal concentration compared to lidocaine. Patients and Methods Ninety-six nulliparous parturients were randomly assigned to three groups: LD group, patients received the conventional initial dose of 6 mL of 1% lidocaine; CP1.5 group, patients received 6 mL of 1.5% chloroprocaine as the initial dose; and CP1.2 group, patients received 7.5 mL of 1.2% chloroprocaine as initial dose. Labor analgesia was maintained in all patients via a programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB). The primary outcome was the analgesia onset time. Secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale (VAS) scores, the interval and duration of uterine contractions during the first 12 contractions, failure to reach adequate analgesia, labor and neonatal outcomes, maternal satisfaction and adverse effects. Results Parturients in the CP1.5 and CP1.2 groups achieved a shorter onset time than those in the LD group (hazard ratio (HR) = 6.540; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.503-12.210; P < 0.001 and HR = 3.460; 95% CI, 1.905-6.282; P < 0.001, respectively). The median time (95% CIs) to adequate analgesia was 12.0 (10.9-13.1), 7.0 (6.2-7.8) and 8.0 (7.5-8.5) minutes in the LD, CP1.5 and CP1.2 groups, respectively. PIEB in the CP1.5 group was associated with lower VAS scores, patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) boluses, and analgesic consumption; a shorter time from epidural initiation to the first PCEA demand; and higher maternal satisfaction scores than the other two groups (P < 0.01). The interval and duration of uterine contractions, labor and newborn outcomes and adverse effects were comparable among the three groups. Conclusion Chloroprocaine provided a faster onset of labor analgesia than lidocaine.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between preoperative magnetic resonance imaging findings and intradiscal cement leakage after percutaneous vertebral augmentation, and to analyze whether endplate fractures and adjacent intervertebral disc injuries affect the incidence of intradiscal cement leakage. METHODS: Totally 182 patients with single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from September 2018 to December 2019 were selected, of which 110 received percutaneous kyphoplasty treatment, 72 cases received percutaneous vertebroplasty treatment. According to the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging images, the condition of the adjacent intervertebral disc injury and endplate fracture of the fractured vertebral body was evaluated. According to whether there is intradiscal cement leakage after the operation, the patients were divided into a leakage group (n=32) and a non-leakage group (n=150). A univariate analysis was performed on the correlation between the patients age, gender, surgical spinal level, surgical method, endplate fracture, adjacent intervertebral disc injury and intradiscal cement leakage, and then a multivariate binary logistics regression model analysis was performed. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Of the 182 patients, 63 had endplate fractures and 98 had adjacent intervertebral disc injuries. In all patients, 32 cases of intradiscal cement leakage occurred after percutaneous vertebral augmentation;the leakage rate of the endplate fracture group was higher than that of the non-endplate fracture group (P < 0.05), and the leakage rate of the intervertebral disc injury group was higher than that of the non-intervertebral disc injury group (P < 0.05). (2) The results of univariate analysis showed that intradiscal cement leakage was related to surgical method (P < 0.05), which was not related to age, gender, and surgical spinal level (P > 0.05). (3) The binary logistics regression analysis showed that the endplate fracture was the independent risk factor for intradiscal cement leakage after percutaneous vertebral augmentation;adjacent intervertebral disc injury, age, gender, surgical method, and surgical spinal level were not the risk factors for intradiscal cement leakage. (4) Related analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between the endplate fracture and the intervertebral disc injury (r=0.47, P=0.000). (5) The results showed that the endplate fracture found in the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging was a risk factor for intradiscal cement leakage, and the intervertebral disc injury was not the influence factor of intradiscal cement leakage;the intervertebral disc injury was significantly related to the endplate fracture in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures patients.

The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004) Methods: The study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 microgram, 7.5 microgram, and 15 microgram) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion assay and interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and 42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0, 21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We performed a primary analysis at day 42. Results: A total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFN-gamma and IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses, both IFN-gamma and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after the first dose while IFN-gamma and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03 has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 microgram CoVLP dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were ~10-times higher than those observed in individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN-gamma and IL-4 responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 microgram)+AS03 has a good benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded populations and to efficacy evaluations","output":"Phase 1 trial of a Candidate Recombinant Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for Covid-19 Disease Produced in Plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, with 19% of total confirmed patients classified as severe or critical experiencing complications such as dyspnea, hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or multiorgan failure.

CASE DESCRIPTION: This case discusses the Baylor Scott and White Institute for Rehab (BSWIR) Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) department COVID-19 acute care therapy team's creation of a telehealth strategy to provide early rehabilitative intervention without increasing the odds of disease transmission. OUTCOMES: The COVID-19 therapy team created a simple process for identifying and triaging care for patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19.

COVID-19 is not only an aggressive respiratory illness similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome but also highly contagious and a risk for health care providers. Telehealth strategies allow therapists to intervene early, opening the possibility to maximize recovery and prevent harm or decompensation. Telehealth strategies can be more prevention-focused while the patient is experiencing relatively good health with goals to maximize strength and endurance before the disease process evolves to critical illness.

The linear stapler was closed and fired to attach the posterior walls of the remnant stomach and the duodenum together. After creating a good view of the greater curvature side of the entry hole for the stapler by retracting the knotted suture on the lesser curvature side toward the ventral side, we performed single-layer entire-thickness continuous suturing of this hole using a 15-cm-long barbed suture running from the greater curvature side to the lesser curvature side. We placed the second and third stitches between the seromuscular layer of the remnant stomach and the entire-thickness layer of the duodenum while suturing the duodenal mucosa as minutely as possible. In addition, we routinely added one or two entire-thickness knotted sutures at the site near the greater curvature side. We placed similar additional knotted sutures at the site with a broad pitch. TLDG with this reconstruction technique was successfully performed in all patients with no occurrences of anastomotic leakage or intraabdominal abscess around the anastomosis. It is suggested that this method can be one option for delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in TLDG due to its cost-effectiveness and feasibility.","output":"An option for delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer: A single-layer suturing technique for the stapler entry hole using knotless barbed sutures combined with the application of additional knotted sutures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given COVID-19 pandemic periodic outpatient assessment of otitis-prone children regularly followed at our tertiary outpatient clinic of upper respiratory tract infections was discontinued since 9 March.

Considering the widely spread COVID-19, it is of great benefit to develop an automated and accurate system for quantification of COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities using thick-section chest CT images. Purpose: To develop a fully automated AI system to quantitatively assess the disease severity and disease progression using thick-section chest CT images. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a deep learning based system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19 infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. 531 thick-section CT scans from 204 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital from 23 January 2020 to 12 February 2020. The lung abnormalities were first segmented by a deep learning model. To assess the disease severity (non-severe or severe) and the progression, two imaging bio-markers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU). The performance of lung abnormality segmentation was examined using Dice coefficient, while the assessment of disease severity and the disease progression were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Cohen's kappa statistic, respectively. Results: Dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and the manual delineations of two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19 infected lung abnormalities were 0.74 {+/-} 0.28 and 0.76 {+/-} 0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement, i.e., 0.79 {+/-} 0.25. The computed two imaging bio-markers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.9680 (p-value < 0.001). Very good agreement ({kappa} = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists were achieved on evaluating the changes of infection volumes. Conclusions: A deep learning based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities, assess the disease severity and its progressions.","output":"From Community Acquired Pneumonia to COVID-19: A Deep Learning Based Method for Quantitative Analysis of COVID-19 on thick-section CT Scans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social and economic consequences among the global public. Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps in knowledge and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire that took place in April 2020, which targeted people residing in Jordan, aged 18 and above. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, males, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety levels. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic. The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact of the disease.","output":"COVID-19 misinformation: Mere harmless delusions or much more?

Transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) under the cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2) represent a lethal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The precise mechanisms of lethality in this mouse model remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection for up to 14 days post-infection. Despite infection and moderate pneumonia, rapid clinical decline or death of mice was invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion and direct neuronal injury (including brain and spinal neurons). Neuroinvasion was observed as early as 4 dpi, with virus initially restricted to the olfactory bulb supporting axonal transport via the olfactory neuroepithelium as the earliest portal of entry. No evidence of viremia was detected suggesting neuroinvasion occurs independently of entry across the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 tropism was not restricted to ACE2-expressing cells (e.g., AT1 pneumocytes), and some ACE2-positive lineages were not associated with the presence of viral antigen (e.g., bronchiolar epithelium and brain capillaries). Detectable ACE2 expression was not observed in neurons, supporting overexpression of ACE2 in the nasal passages and neuroepithelium as more likely determinants of neuroinvasion in the K18-hACE2 model. Although our work incites caution in the utility of the K18-hACE2 model to study global aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, it underscores this model as a unique platform for exploring the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis that may have clinical relevance acknowledging the growing body of evidence that suggests COVID-19 may result in long-standing neurologic consequences. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than 191 million people with over 4 million fatalities (2021-07-20). The development of animal models recapitulating distinctive features of severe COVID-19 is critical to enhancing our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and in the evaluation of vaccine and therapeutic efficacy. Transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) under the cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2) represent a lethal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show lethality of this model is invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion linked with viral replication and assembly. Importantly, pneumonia albeit invariably present was generally moderate with the absence of culturable infectious virus at peak neuroinvasion. The dynamics of viral neuroinvasion and pneumonia were only partially dependent on hACE2. Overall, this study provides an in-depth sequential characterization of the K18-hACE2 model following SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting its significance to further study the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis.","output":"Fatal neuroinvasion and SARS-CoV-2 tropism in K18-hACE2 mice is partially independent on hACE2 expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viruses are known to be the most frequent causative mediators of lung infections in humans, bearing significant impact on the host cell signaling machinery due to their host-dependency for efficient replication.

The sample consisted of 23 schools, with 69 observations at different times of the school day. The COVID-19 outbreak made it necessary to extend the present study to identify changes in school recess forced by the pandemic. In this second phase, 34 school schoolteachers were interviewed. The results show little or no adult involvement during recess, beyond mere supervision, and the need for training to improve school recess management. Regarding the changes made during the pandemic, it is concluded that there was a good implementation of protocols, an increase in organization and a reduction in conflicts. The design of school recesses with the participation of schoolteachers and students is important, although during the pandemic, this idea has taken a back seat, with schoolteachers assuming the role of dividing groups and spaces, and supervising transitions.

We developed and validated some modifications of the IFN- ELISPOT assay to optimize immunological monitoring of various cancer vaccine trials. Taking into consideration that the main mechanism of cell-mediated cytotoxicity is the release of cytolytic granules that contain, among others, cytolytic protein Granzyme B (GrB), we developed the GrB ELISPOT assay. Extensive studies demonstrated that the GrB ELISPOT assay is specific, accurately measures the rapid release of GrB, is more sensitive than the 51Cr-release assay, and that it may be successfully applied to measuring CTL precursory frequency in PBMC from cancer patients. Assuming that immunological assays that demonstrate recognition of native tumor cells (tumor-specific) may be more clinically relevant than assays that demonstrate recognition of tumor protein or peptide (antigen-specific), we developed and validated the Autologous Tumor IFN- ELISPOT assay using PBMC from idiotype vaccinated lymphoma patients as effectors and autologous B cell lymphoma tumor cells as targets. The precursor frequency of tumor-reactive T cells was significantly higher in the postvaccine PBMC, compared with prevaccine samples in all patients tested. Furthermore, the specificity of these T cells was established by the lack of reactivity against autologous normal B cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility of evaluating tumor-specific T cell responses when autologous, primary tumor cells are available as targets. Modifications of ELISPOT assay described in this chapter allow more comprehensive assessment of low frequency tumor-specific CTL and their specific effector functions and can provide valuable insight with regards to immune responses in cancer vaccine trials.","output":"Modified ELISPOT: Modifications of the Elispot Assay for T Cell Monitoring in Cancer Vaccine Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The knowledge-based economy has drawn increasing attention recently, particularly in online shopping applications where all the transactions and consumer opinions are logged.

The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has a great impact on the different aspects of our daily life, in particular, on our shopping behaviour. To predict electronic consumer behaviour could be of valuable help for managers in government, supply chain and retail industry. Although, before coronavirus pandemic we have experienced online shopping, during the disease the number of online shopping increased dramatically. Due to high speed transmission of COVID-19, we have to observe personal and social health issues such as social distancing and staying at home. These issues have direct effect on consumer behaviour in online shopping. In this paper, a prediction model is proposed to anticipate the consumers behaviour using machine learning methods. Five individual classifiers, and their ensembles with Bagging and Boosting are examined on the dataset collected from an online shopping site.

Although extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is sometimes used in critically patients with COVID-19, ECMO is only an adjunct, not the main treatment. If the patient's condition deteriorates and it is determined to be irreversible, it is necessary to decide to stop ECMO. A 54-year-old man was admitted on day 6 of onset with a chief complaint of high fever and cough. Computed tomography (CT) showed a ground glass opacity in both lungs, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosed COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital and started to receive oxygen and favipiravir. After that, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and he was intubated and ventilated on day 9 of onset, and ECMO was introduced on day 12. Two days after the introduction of ECMO, C-reactive protein (CRP) increased, chest X-p showed no improvement in pneumonia, and PaO2/FiO2 decreased again. As D-dimer rose and found a blood clot in the ECMO circuit, we had to decide whether to replace the circuit and continue with ECMO or stop ECMO. At this time, the viral load by RT-PCR was drastically reduced to about 1/1750. We decided to continue ECMO therapy and replaced the circuit. The patient's respiratory status subsequently improved and ECMO was stopped on day 21 of onset.

Affected countries have responded with more effective surveillance strategies to detect outbreaks early, monitor the trends, and implement prevention and control measures. We have applied newly developed machine learning approaches to identify laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from 4,894 emergency department patients with dengue-like illness (DLI) who received laboratory tests. Among them, 60.11% (2942 cases) were confirmed to have dengue. Using just four input variables [age, body temperature, white blood cells counts (WBCs) and platelets], not only the state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) prediction models but also the conventional decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR) models delivered performances with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves areas under curves (AUCs) of the ranging from 83.75% to 85.87% [for DT, DNN and LR: 84.60%  0.03%, 85.87%  0.54%, 83.75%  0.17%, respectively]. Subgroup analyses found all the models were very sensitive particularly in the pre-epidemic period. Pre-peak sensitivities (<35 weeks) were 92.6%, 92.9%, and 93.1% in DT, DNN, and LR respectively. Adjusted odds ratios examined with LR for low WBCs [ 3.2 (x10(3)/L)], fever (38C), low platelet counts [< 100 (x10(3)/L)], and elderly ( 65 years) were 5.17 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.96C6.76], 3.17 [95%CI: 2.74C3.66], 3.10 [95%CI: 2.44C3.94], and 1.77 [95%CI: 1.50C2.10], respectively. Our prediction models can readily be used in resource-poor countries where viral/serologic tests are inconvenient and can also be applied for real-time syndromic surveillance to monitor trends of dengue cases and even be integrated with mosquito/environment surveillance for early warning and immediate prevention/control measures. In other words, a local community hospital/clinic with an instrument of complete blood counts (including platelets) can provide a sentinel screening during outbreaks.

Objective To develop the STROBE-MR Statement as a stand-alone extension to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guideline for the reporting of MR studies. Design, Setting, and Participants The development of the STROBE-MR Statement followed the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) framework guidance and used the STROBE Statement as a starting point to draft a checklist tailored to MR studies. The project was initiated in 2018 by reviewing the literature on the reporting of instrumental variable and MR studies. A group of 17 experts, including MR methodologists, MR study design users, developers of previous reporting guidelines, and journal editors, participated in a workshop in May 2019 to define the scope of the Statement and draft the checklist. The draft checklist was published as a preprint in July 2019 and discussed on the preprint platform, in social media, and at the 4th Mendelian Randomization Conference. The checklist was then revised based on comments, further refined through 2020, and finalized in July 2021. Findings The STROBE-MR checklist is organized into 6 sections (Title and Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Other Information) and includes 20 main items and 30 subitems. It covers both 1-sample and 2-sample MR studies that assess 1 or multiple exposures and outcomes, and addresses MR studies that follow a genome-wide association study and are reported in the same article. The checklist asks authors to justify why MR is a helpful method to address the study question and state prespecified causal hypotheses. The measurement, quality, and selection of genetic variants must be described and attempts to assess validity of MR-specific assumptions should be well reported. An item on data sharing includes reporting when the data and statistical code required to replicate the analyses can be accessed. Conclusions and Relevance STROBE-MR provides guidelines for reporting MR studies. Improved reporting of these studies could facilitate their evaluation by editors, peer reviewers, researchers, clinicians, and other readers, and enhance the interpretation of their results.","output":"Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Using Mendelian Randomization: The STROBE-MR Statement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeA number of food poverty definitions have been identified by academics and various government organisations globally;however, there exists no government-endorsed definition of food poverty in the United Kingdom (UK), and there remains a gap regarding how relevant current food poverty definitions are in the Northern Ireland (NI)/UK contexts Design/methodology/approachInterviews (n = 19) with a range of stakeholders (e g policymakers, politicians, community advice centre workers, consumer sub-group representatives, food bank and food redistribution organisation representatives) were conducted to examine (1) the usefulness of a food poverty definition, (2) what a food poverty definition should include and (3) the applicability of an existing definition (Radimer et al , 1992) in the NI/UK context Data was thematically analysed using QSR NVivo (v 12) FindingsDefinition was considered important to increase awareness and understanding Any consideration of revising the Radimer et al (1992) definition, or of establishing a new standardised definition, should seek to reduce/remove ambiguity and subjectivity of terminology used (i e more clearly defining what the terms adequate, sufficient, quality and socially acceptable ways mean in this context) Practical implicationsThis research emphasises the importance of appropriately conceptually defining social phenomena such as food poverty, as a first step to constructing and reviewing measurement approaches and ultimately assessing predictors and recommending solutions Originality/valueThis research addresses the gap relating to stakeholders opinion on food poverty definition and contributes recommendations for modifying the Radimer et al (1992) definition in the NI/UK and present-day contexts","output":"Stakeholder-informed considerations for a food poverty definition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cities increasingly face flood risk primarily due to extensive changes of the natural land cover to built-up areas with impervious surfaces.

COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure. Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death. To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease. Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body. The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects. Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD. This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-dependent mechanisms and the potential interaction with ACE2 expression and cell surface localization. We aim to provide a list of potential treatment options and a better understanding of why CVD is a high risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and further discuss the acute as well as long-term cardiac consequences.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2-dependent implications on the cardiovascular system: From basic science to clinical implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postconcussion syndrome (PCS) is a term attributed to the constellation of symptoms that fail to recover after a concussion. PCS is associated with a variety of symptoms such as headaches, concentration deficits, fatigue, depression and anxiety that have an enormous impact on patients' lives. There is currently no diagnostic biomarker for PCS. There have been attempts at identifying structural and functional brain changes in patients with PCS, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), respectively, and relate them to specific PCS symptoms. In this scoping review, we appraised, synthesised and summarised all empirical studies that (1) investigated structural or functional brain changes in PCS using DTI or fMRI, respectively, and (2) assessed behavioural alterations in patients with PCS. We performed a literature search in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and PsycINFO (Ovid) for primary research articles published up to February 2020. We identified 8306 articles and included 45 articles that investigated the relationship between DTI and fMRI parameters and behavioural changes in patients with PCS: 20 diffusion, 20 fMRI studies and 5 papers with both modalities. Most frequently studied structures were the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus in diffusion and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and default mode network in the fMRI literature. Although some white matter and fMRI changes were correlated with cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms, there were no consistent, converging findings on the relationship between neuroimaging abnormalities and behavioural changes which could be largely due to the complex and heterogeneous presentation of PCS. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of symptoms in PCS may preclude discovery of one biomarker for all patients. Further research should take advantage of multimodal neuroimaging to better understand the brain-behaviour relationship, with a focus on individual differences rather than on group comparisons.","output":"Diffusion and functional MRI findings and their relationship to behaviour in postconcussion syndrome: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of translation theory in translator education seems to be undergoing a crisis as universities struggle to provide graduates with practical, market-driven skills that will increase their employability. The overnight transition to online delivery in the time of educational disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened the challenges in making theoretical courses relevant for students. This paper explores the application of the flipped classroom model in a translation theory course on the graduate (MA) level, delivered in the context of emergency remote teaching. The course is described and evaluated with the help of student feedback (N=30) elicited via an online questionnaire. The main source of data are responses to open-ended questions, which are analysed qualitatively. The data are coded for general perceptions of the flipped classroom and its four course components (videos, experimental translation assignments, forum discussion assignments, synchronous Zoom discussions), as well as for perceptions of teacher support. Lessons are drawn for emergency remote teaching but also for future face-to-face teaching of theory-oriented translation courses.","output":"'it Felt like We Were All Hanging out While Talking about Translation Theory': Lessons Learned from a Flipped Translation Theory Course in Emergency Remote Teaching during the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, there are no treatment options available for the deadly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a process of identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs and it is considered as a very effective strategy for drug discovery as it involves less time and cost to find a therapeutic agent in comparison to the de novo drug discovery process. The present review will focus on the repurposing efficacy of the currently used drugs against COVID-19 and their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and their future perspective. Relevant articles with experimental studies conducted in-silico, in-vitro, in-vivo, clinical trials in humans, case reports, and news archives were selected for the review. Number of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and interferons have shown inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV2 in-vitro as well as in clinical conditions. These drugs either act through virus-related targets such as RNA genome, polypeptide packing and uptake pathways or target host-related pathways involving angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors and inflammatory pathways.

Specifically we aim to connect discoveries from disparate laboratory experimentation in the area of trauma, blood loss and blood clotting using data science methods in a collaborative ensemble setting. Trauma related grave injuries cause exsanguination and death, constituting up to 50% of deaths especially in the armed forces. Restricting blood loss in such scenarios usually requires the presence of first responders, which is not feasible in certain cases. Moreover, a traumatic event may lead to a cytokine storm, reflected in the cytokine variables. Hemostatic nanoparticles have been developed to tackle these kinds of situations of trauma and blood loss. This paper highlights a collaborative effort of using data science methods in evaluating the outcomes from a lab study to further understand the efficacy of the nanoparticles. An intravenous administration of hemostatic nanoparticles was executed in pigs that had to undergo hemorrhagic shock and blood loss and other immune response variables, cytokine response variables are measured. Thus, through various hemostatic nanoparticles used in the intervention, multiple data outcomes are produced and it becomes critical to understand which nanoparticles are critical and what variables are key to study further variations in the lab. We propose a collaborative data mining framework which combines the results from multiple data mining methods to discover impactful features. We used frequent patterns observed in the data from these experiments. We further validate the connections between these frequent rules by comparing the results with decision trees and feature ranking. Both the frequent patterns and the decision trees help us identify the critical variables that stand out in the lab studies and need further validation and follow up in future studies. The outcomes from the data mining methods help produce a computational design map of the experimental results.

Therefore, a multi-methods approach is used. First we use a systematic literature review for reviewing the state of the art of digital health applications in healthcare. Furthermore, the usage of digital health applications is mapped to the different processes in care delivery. Here we provide an exemplary process model of oncological care delivery. The analysis shows that including digital health solutions may be helpful for care delivery in most processes of medical care provisioning. However, research on digital health solutions focuses strongly on some few processes and specific disciplines while other processes and medical disciplines are underrepresented in literature.

The encounter between thought and practice may be lasting;beliefs may affect training and practice. Leaders in organizations may play a more active role than the one often depicted in management fashion theory. The ideas represent a trade-off between business strategy, leadership, and employees. We keep acceptable and adequate ideas while we drop unacceptable and inadequate plans. The ideas work like a sensitizing concept of directions along which to look for temporary order and stability. Adopting a business idea is like a virus spreading worldwide, leaving an enormous strength through global corporations and societies. The study methodology is built upon a total of 20 in depth interviews in Telia and Telenor done in 2019 and 2020. We also analyzed the annual reports for 2020 for the 20 largest corporations at the stock markets in Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen (N=60) to compare the results. We developed seven hypotheses from the literature foundation for empirical testing. We identified the following ideas at Telia (Sweden) and Telenor (Norway): Globalization, digitalization, sustainability, trust-based leadership, value-based leadership, virtual teams, project management agility, and flexible workplaces. The ideas came up both top-down as strategic intentions and bottom-up as the direction of work or by the COVID-19 crisis. We found that most of the 60 largest corporations at the Scandinavian stock market practice the same ideas. We have thus concluded that strategic and leadership concepts work as traveling ideas. These buzz words go to almost any private business forming the way of thinking and working as a traveling virus. We argue that this article's empirical test supports our belief that a virus-inspired theory gives a more vibrant picture than the fashion theory. Our analysis shows that four of our six hypotheses, derived from the virus-inspired theory, are strengthened by Telia and Telenor's empirical explorative story.

Virtual reality (VR) paradigms are successful in eliciting cue-induced subjective craving and may even elicit stronger craving than traditional picture-cue methods. However, few studies have leveraged the advances of this technology to improve the assessment of craving. OBJECTIVE: This report details the development of a novel, translatable VR paradigm designed to both elicit nicotine craving and assess multiple eye-related characteristics as potential objective correlates of craving. METHODS: A VR paradigm was developed, which includes three Active scenes with nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) cues present, and three Neutral scenes devoid of NTP cues. A pilot sample (N=31) of NTP users underwent the paradigm and completed subjective measures of nicotine craving, sense of presence in the VR paradigm, and VR-related sickness. Eye-gaze fixation time (attentional bias) and pupil diameter toward Active versus Neutral cues, as well as spontaneous blink rate during the Active and Neutral scenes, were recorded. RESULTS: The NTP Cue VR paradigm was found to elicit a moderate sense of presence (mean Igroup Presence Questionnaire score 60.05, SD 9.66) and low VR-related sickness (mean Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire score 16.25, SD 13.94). Scene-specific effects on attentional bias and pupil diameter were observed, with two of the three Active scenes eliciting greater NTP versus control cue attentional bias and pupil diameter (Cohen d=0.30-0.92). The spontaneous blink rate metrics did not differ across Active and Neutral scenes. CONCLUSIONS: This report outlines the development of the NTP Cue VR paradigm. Our results support the potential of this paradigm as an effective laboratory-based cue-exposure task and provide early evidence of the utility of attentional bias and pupillometry, as measured during VR, as useful markers for nicotine addiction.","output":"Using Virtual Reality to Induce and Assess Objective Correlates of Nicotine Craving: Paradigm Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a method of controlling the arterial carbon dioxide tension of patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

In reflecting on how intersectionality has advanced feminist research in psychology, this paper provides a critical analysis of potential novel research avenues for neurofeminism. We identify three main research themes guided by intersectionality. The first theme involves research centered on understanding the socio-structural causes of health inequalities experienced by individuals with intersecting marginalized social identities; the second concerns research addressing the psychological processing of social group memberships that underlies the enactment of systemic discriminatory practices; and the third theme comprises intersectionality research that aims to challenge psychological epistemology.

However, there remain gaps in our understanding of how clinicians have adapted to telehealth. This study aims to explore the telehealth experiences of specialists, based at a tertiary hospital in the Hunter Region, and general practitioners (GP), including barriers, enablers and opportunities. METHODS: An interpretative qualitative study involving in-depth interviews explored the telehealth experiences of specialists, based at a tertiary hospital in the Hunter Region of Australia, and GPs, including barriers, enablers and opportunities. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach with constant comparison. RESULTS: Individual interviews were conducted with 10 specialists and five GPs. Key themes were identified: (1) transition to telehealth has been valuable but challenging; (2) persisting telehealth process barriers need to be addressed; (3) establishing when face-to-face consults are essential; (4) changes in workload pressures and potential for double-up; (5) essential modification of work practices; and (6) exploring what is needed going forward.

Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations: No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918.

Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and transmission in domestic cats. Cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel cats were introduced. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats. Serology showed that both, principals and sentinels, developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was performed at a large paediatric academic institution to identify patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a screening electrocardiogram by their primary care providers and were subsequently referred for outpatient cardiology consultation due to an abnormal electrocardiogram. The outcomes were the results from their cardiology evaluations, including testing and final diagnoses. RESULTS: Among 46 patients, during their preceding COVID-19 illness, the majority had mild symptoms, 4 were asymptomatic, and 1 had moderate symptoms. The median length of time from positive SARS-CoV-2 test to screening electrocardiogram was 22 days, and many electrocardiogram findings that prompted cardiology consultation were normal variants in asymptomatic adolescent athletes. Patients underwent frequent additional testing at their cardiology appointments: repeat electrocardiogram (72%), echocardiogram (59%), Holter monitor (11%), exercise stress test (7%), and cardiac MRI (2%). Five patients were incidentally diagnosed with CHD or structural cardiac abnormalities, and three patients had conduction abnormalities (pre-mature atrial contractions, pre-mature ventricular contractions, borderline prolonged QTc), although potentially incidental to COVID-19. No patients were diagnosed with myocarditis or ventricular dysfunction. CONCLUSION: In a small cohort of children with prior COVID-19, who were primarily either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, subsequent screening electrocardiograms identified various potential abnormalities prompting cardiology consultation, but no patient was diagnosed with myocarditis.

However, little is known about parent and clinician perspectives about the acceptability of GSH for adolescents with eating disorders. METHODS: This study utilized a mixed methods approach to obtain qualitative and quantitative data regarding clinician and participants experiences with GSH. Parent participants were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing GSH family-based treatment (GSH-FBT) to family-based treatment delivered via videoconferencing (FBT-V) for adolescents (12C18 years old) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN). Parent participants provided qualitative feedback using the Helping Alliances Questionnaire about their experience of treatment. Clinician participants were six masters or PhD-level therapists. These clinicians were trained in and provided both treatments (GSH-FBT and FBT-V). They provided responses to questionnaires and participated in a 1-h focus group about their experience as treatment providers. RESULTS: Regardless of treatment condition, parents listed more improvement than worsening of symptoms in their child with AN. Clinicians reported lower scores on competency and comfort metrics with GSH-FBT compared to FBT-V. Qualitatively, clinicians reported both advantages and disadvantages of delivering GSH-FBT.

Early adolescence is a time of transition and reorientation. This study considers the impact of the first UK Covid-19 lockdown on early adolescents. Methods The study topic was identified through a consultation process which aimed to provide appropriate evidence to local decision makers in Bradford, UK and plan for future interventions. Children and their parents were sampled from the Born in Bradford cohort. 41 interviews (with 20 families: 20 parents and 21 children) were carried out between August and September 2020. Interview data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results The transitional age of the children interviewed had an important influence on their experience Covid-19 and the first UK lockdown. Their age combined with lockdown and school closures meant that they missed out on key learning and social opportunities at a crucial time in their lives. Covid-19 and lockdown also disrupted their daily mental wellbeing and led to increased anxiety, lethargy and low moods, during a period of personal change and social transition. Conclusion For children at the start of their adolescence undergoing change and formation, the experiences and feelings Covid-19 has set in motion will likely have an impact on their mental and cognitive functioning as they develop further.

Globally, several vaccines have been produced to be effective against COVID-19. This survey aimed to assess the demand and intent towards the COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Ethiopia. Also, factors influencing their demand, intention, and willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine were described, which is poorly understood in resource-limited settings. METHODS: Subjects were 1160 individuals who completed an online questionnaire from February to March 2021. The study used the health belief model (HBM) to evaluate participants intention to receive and willingness to pay (WTP) regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Chi-square and binary logistic regression were conducted to identify the prevalence and associated factors of demand and WTP. Multinomial regression was done to examine the intent to receive a vaccine. RESULTS: In total 1116 responses were collected. The results indicated a moderate level of demand and WTP among participants (64.7% and 56.0%, respectively). Further, the researchers examined participants readiness towards COVID-19 vaccination, where 46.6% of participants had a definite intent, and close to half of the participants are unsure (32.8%) or unwilling (20.7%) to get vaccinated. Among other factors, items under perceived susceptibility and perceived benefits constructs in the HBM have been associated with participants demand, willingness to vaccinate, and WTP. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the usefulness of the HBM model in evaluating the demand, intention, and willingness of participants to pay for COVID-19. Improving public awareness of the vulnerability should be a major point of attention to reduce the barriers, and improve demand and intention for COVID-19. Moreover, public health messages should be tailored to enhance vaccine literacy.","output":"Factors Influencing COVID-19 Vaccination Demand and Intent in Resource-Limited Settings: Based on Health Belief Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We will understand this pandemic only when we have more data","output":"Testing times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines whether character strengths predict resilience (operationalized as stable or higher mental health and subjective well-being despite an adverse event) over a period of approximately 1 month during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Spain. Using a longitudinal design, participants (N = 348 adults) completed online measures of sociodemographic data, information regarding their situation in relation to the COVID-19, character strengths, general mental health, life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect. All variables were measured at Time 1 and Time 2, except for sociodemographic and most COVID-related information (Time 1 only). Time 1 data collection was conducted between March 21, 2020 and April 2, 2020, i.e., approximately the second week of lockdown in Spain. Time 2 data collection was conducted between April 24, 2020 and May 18, 2020, after the Spanish government announced its intention to progressively release the lockdown. A principal component analysis of character strengths was conducted. Five character strength factors were extracted: fortitude, goodness, intellectual, interpersonal, and restraint. Factor structures at Times 1 and 2 were highly consistent. All character strength factors at Time 1 correlated positively with life satisfaction and positive affect, and negatively with negative affect and mental health at T2 (higher scores in the mental health measure indicate poorer mental health). Fortitude strengths showed the highest correlations. We conducted a series of regression analyses with strength factors at Time 1 as predictors, and mental health, life satisfaction, and positive and negative affect as dependent variables, controlling for their baseline levels. To test the directionality of the relationship between strengths and the dependent variables, all analyses were reversed. All character strength factors predicted an increase in mental health. They also predicted positive affect, with the exception of strengths of restraint. Fortitude, intellectual, and interpersonal strengths predicted an increase in life satisfaction. Finally, fortitude strengths, interpersonal strengths, and strengths of restraint, predicted a decrease in negative affect. None of the reversed analyses yielded significant effects. Limitations, implications, and possible character strengths-based interventions aimed at promoting mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","output":"Character Strengths Predict an Increase in Mental Health and Subjective Well-Being Over a One-Month Period During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral pathogens are a common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in adults.

METHODS Sources for this review included searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, and international government/major association websites using terms including adiposity, adiposopathy, epigenetics, genetics, and obesity. RESULTS Excessive energy storage in adipose tissue often results in fat cell and fat organ dysfunction, which may cause metabolic and fat mass disorders. The adverse clinical manifestations of obesity are not solely due to the amount of body fat (adiposity), but are also dependent on anatomical and functional perturbations (adiposopathy or 'sick fat'). This review describes extragenetic factors and genetic conditions that promote obesity. It also serves as an introduction to epigenetic dysregulation (i.e., abnormalities in gene expression that occur without alteration in the genetic code itself), which may contribute to obesity and adiposopathic metabolic health outcomes in offspring. Within the epigenetic paradigm, obesity is a transgenerational disease, with weight lost or gained by either parent potentially impacting generational risk for obesity and its complications.

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are erasing gains in poverty reduction achieved over the past several decades. At the same time, climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, especially in poor rural communities. In this paper, we review approaches to measuring poverty and well-being finding that standard approaches to measuring poverty and poverty dynamics typically do not adequately consider environmental goods and services, leading to an incompelete understanding of poverty dynamics among policy makers and practitioners. We identify four archetypal poverty trajectories and discuss how subsistence and cash income, assets, and non-material benefits from forests and tree-based systems influence each of them. We draw on the broad literature on forests and livelihoods, acknowledging that the majority of the literature on the topic of forests and poverty relies on static, micro-level, and highly contextualized analyses. Our review suggest that forests and tree-based systems provide a pathway out of poverty only under very specific conditions, when high value goods are accessible and marketed, or when ecosystem services can be monetized for the benefit of people living in or near forests. However, the role that forests play in supporting and maintaining current consumption, diversifying incomes, and meeting basic needs may be extremely important, particularly for those experiencing transient poverty. We discuss negative externalities associated with living proximate to forests, including the special case of geographic poverty traps, which can occur in remote forested areas. To build a strong evidence base for policy makers we recommend that research on forest-poverty dynamics address longer time-frames (up to decades), larger and/or nested spatial scales, and are contextualized within the landscape, region, or national setting where it is conducted. Advancing our understanding of forest-poverty dynamics is critical, particularly in low and middle-income countries where large numbers of people live in or near forests or in landscapes with forest-agriculture mosaics.

Data concerning optimal anticoagulation are anecdotal, and so far, there are scattered reports of danaparoid use in VITT management. Danaparoid has good efficacy and safety in treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We report here our experience of the administration and monitoring danaparoid in VITT. METHODS: We diagnosed a series of six hospitalized cases of VITT, based on the international diagnostic guidance. All VITT-related data were from the local electronic medical and laboratory record system and were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics. RESULTS: Predominately women in their late 40s developed VITT on average 24 days (range 9C59) after the first ChAdOx1 dose. Clinical presentation included single or multiple venous and/or arterial thrombosis, moderate thrombocytopenia and high D-dimer levels. After detecting PF4 antibodies subcutaneous danaparoid was our first-line antithrombotic treatment with an average duration of three weeks.

To ascertain whether it is necessary to treat these patients in hospitals, especially in asymptomatic cases, we summarize and analyze the clinical and treatment characteristics of patients re-admitted to hospital with a second COVID-19 infection. Methods: Of the 141 COVID-19 cases admitted to the Wenzhou Central Hospital between January 17, 2020, to March 5, 2020, which were followed until March 30, 2020, 12 patients were re-admitted with a second COVID-19 infection. Data was collected and analyzed from their clinical records, lab indexes, commuted tomography (CT), and treatment strategies. Results: Most of the 141 patients had positive outcomes from treatment, with only 12 (8.5%) being re-admitted. In this sub-group: one (8.3%) had a fever, a high white blood cell count (WBC), and progressive CT changes; and one (8.3%) had increased transaminase. The PCR tests of these two patients returned negative results. Another 10 patients were admitted due to a positive PCR test result, seven of which were clinically asymptomatic. Compared to the CT imaging following their initial discharge, the CT imaging of all patients was significantly improved, and none required additional oxygen or mechanical ventilation during their second course of treatment. Conclusions: The prognoses of the re-admitted patients were good with no serious cases. We conclude that home treatment with concentrated medical observation is a safe and feasible course of treatment if the patient returns a positive PCR test result but does not display serious clinical symptoms.

Results: COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs 66.8 pmol/L, -52.7% (95%CI: -68.5% to -36.9%); angiotensin II: 37.7 vs 92.5 pmol/L, -59.2% (95%CI: -72.1% to -46.3%); angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs 6.6 pmol/L, -49.7% (95%CI: -59.2% to -40.2%); angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs 7.6 pmol/L, -64.9% (95%CI: -84.5% to -45.3%)). While the plasma renin activity was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs 207.9 pmol/L, -58.5% (95%CI: -71.4% to -45.6%)), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions: As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether the lower levels of the protective angiotensin (1-5) and (1-7) are linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","output":"Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system peptide profiles in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Plantar pressure distribution after the first metatarsal proximal crescentic osteotomy (FMPCO) with lesser metatarsal proximal shortening osteotomy (LMPSO) for hallux valgus with metatarsalgia has not been previously described.

So far, data on the impact of the pandemic on gastroenterological facilities are lacking, especially on a temporal course. A database is lacking, especially for the outpatient care sector. University Hospital of Augsburg was commissioned to generate data on this as a part of the collaborative project B-FAST of the Network of University Medicine (NUM). METHODS Gastroenterological institutions nationwide were surveyed by an online questionnaire. Recruitment was carried out via the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) and the Professional Association of Gastroenterologists in Private Practice (bng). This manuscript provides an overview of data on the use of protective equipment, pre-interventional testing of patients, staff screening and economic impact over the course of the pandemic. RESULTS 429 facilities answered the questionnaire. Practices tested their patients pre-interventionally significantly less often than clinics (7.8% vs. 82.6%). In clinics, inpatients (93.1%) were tested significantly more often than outpatients (72.2%). The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) increased significantly during the pandemic. It was shown that over 70% of facilities screened their staff for SARS-CoV-2 without cause. Clinics cancelled elective procedures significantly more often than practices in quarter 4/2020. Procedures and turnover decreased in 2020 compared to the previous year. However, fewer facilities were affected by a loss of revenue than expected in previous studies. CONCLUSION Our data demonstrate the variable implementation of pre-interventional SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatient and inpatient care.

The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively. For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day. But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment. The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions [Formula: see text] since in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic. Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase. The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial. In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions [Formula: see text] could satisfy the aforementioned properties. By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results. They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually. Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to [Formula: see text] , in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to [Formula: see text] and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of [Formula: see text] 0.195% in the short-term period of infection. In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February. In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained. A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented. This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China. Based on the presented results, I suggest that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed regularly during daily life and work duties. Moreover, as many as possible the confirmed and suspected cases should be collected to diagnose or treat.","output":"Prediction of numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients (NACP) and the plateau phase of 2019-nCoV in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Similar to other countries, the government of Germany has implemented various restrictions of social life in March 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This results in millions of people being isolated for long periods, which may increase feelings of worry and anxiety. As the consumption of alcohol and tobacco is an often used dysfunctional strategy to cope with such feelings, these restrictions might cause an increase of consumption. Already at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown can increase the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in the future. However, up to now little is known about the changes in alcohol-drinking behavior and tobacco smoking in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To address this theme, we investigated the changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption in the German population aged between 18 and 80 years via an online survey. RESULTS: In total, 3,245 persons participated in the survey; 35.5% of them reported an increase in drinking during the lockdown (42.9% did not change their drinking behavior, 21.3% drank less, and 0.3% started drinking). The odds of consuming more alcohol during lockdown were associated with middle age, higher subjective stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a lower agreement with the importance of the restrictions, and consuming alcohol more than once per week before the lockdown. Also, 45.8% of the participants increased their smoking during the lockdown. The odds of smoking more during lockdown were associated with higher subjective stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that it is important to start campaigns to inform the general population about potential long-term effects of increased alcohol and tobacco consumption and to raise the health-care professionals' awareness of this topic.","output":"The Effects of the Lockdown during the COVID-19 Pandemic on Alcohol and Tobacco Consumption Behavior in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amidst COVID-19, teacher education has shifted to online learning.

Many countries of the world, including Ireland, closed their borders and imposed nationwide lockdown. During this period, all major anthropogenic transport activities, which contribute to atmospheric pollution, were restricted. The current study examines the impact of the transport restrictions on ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and hospital admissions for asthma across Ireland. Methods This is a retrospective population-based cohort study. National ambient air quality monitoring network data were analysed to investigation variations in NO2 concentrations. Asthma hospital admissions data were collected from the HSE Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE) for Cork, Dublin, and Meath. Results During the period of transport restrictions, there were reductions in the annual mean NO2 for Cork, Dublin and Meath (i.e. 12g/m3 to 11g/m3 (p = 1);25g/m3 to 17g/m3 (p < 0.001);and 23g/m3 to 21g/m3 (p = 1)).

Methods: We included for this study all the Mexican patients with RDs and COVID-19 registered from April 17th to October 30th, 2020 in the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry. We compare clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with RDs and COVID-19 to patients with COVID-19 that were selected randomly from the Mexican Epidemiology database (1:3). A logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for confusion variables. Results: We included 322 patients with COVID-19 and RDs and 969 controls without RDs. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics and comorbidities of both groups. Bivariate analysis showed that patients with RDs had higher mortality, were older, and were more frequently hospitalized. Comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and renal diseases were also more frequent in patients with RDs. In the multivariate analysis, having a RD was no longer associated with mortality (Figure 1). Conclusion: Patients with RDs had higher comorbidities, hospitalizations, and mortality than the general population in the bivariate analysis. However, adjusted multivariate analysis showed that the odds for mortality were not increased because of having a RD.

A total of 820 sera and 823 nasal swabs from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, buffaloes, mules, and horses were collected. Swabs were tested using RT-PCR and virus RNA-positive samples were genetically sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. Sera were screened using virus microneutralization tests and positive sera (where available) were confirmed using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). We detected 90% PRNT confirmed MERS-CoV antibody in 35 (55.6%) of 63 sera from sheep collected from Senegal, two sheep (1.8%) of 114 in Tunisia and a goat (0.9%) of 107 in Egypt, with titres ranging from 1:80 to 1:320.

In rare cases, the underlying pathology is a high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery. We report on a series of seven cases with occluded high-grade basilar artery stenosis who received endovascular therapy at our center. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our prospective database since October 2009 until September 2013 was screened for patients with acute basilar artery occlusion and underlying high-grade stenosis who underwent endovascular therapy. Case files were retrospectively reviewed for clinical, outcome, and technical data. RESULTS Seven patients were identified who suffered from an acute basilar artery occlusion based on a high-grade stenosis between October 2009 and September 2013. These patients were treated with an acute stenting of the basilar artery with or without a preceding mechanical thrombectomy. Median age was 75 (53-83) years; median prethrombectomy National Institute of Health Stroke scale score was 19 (7-28). A successful recanalization result defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction grade 2b or higher was achieved in all cases. Two of the seven patients had a procedural complication consisting of a vessel dissection after angioplasty. A good clinical outcome according to the Solitaire flow restoration device versus the Merci Retriever in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (SWIFT) study criteria was achieved in three of the seven patients.

Small social networks are associated with poor quality of life. Preliminary evidence suggests that coaching patients to increase their social contacts may be effective. In this study, we assessed whether structured social coaching improves the quality of life of patients with psychosis (primary outcome) compared with an active control group, receiving information on local social activities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A structured social coaching intervention was developed based on the literature and refined through stakeholder involvement. It draws on principles from motivational interviewing, solution focused therapy and structured information giving. It is provided over a 6-month period and can be delivered by a range of different mental health professionals. Its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are assessed in a randomised controlled trial, compared with an active control group, in which participants are given an information booklet on local social activities. Participants are aged 18 or over, have a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (International Classification of Disease: F20C29) and capacity to provide informed consent. Participants are assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months after individual randomisation. The primary outcome is quality of life at 6 months (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life). We hypothesise that the effects on quality of life are mediated by an increase in social contacts. Secondary outcomes are symptoms, social situation and time spent in social activities. Costs and cost-effectiveness analyses will consider service use and health-related quality of life.

The growing evidence base demonstrating excess female morbidity and mortality reflects the necessity of evaluating the role of women in leadership driving health research, policy and programmatic interventions in conflict-related humanitarian contexts. Despite global commitments to improving gender equality, the issue of women leaders in conflict and humanitarian health has been given little or no attention. The aim of this paper focuses on three domains: importance, barriers and opportunities for women leaders in conflict and humanitarian health. Following thematic analysis of the material collected, we discuss the following themes: barriers of womens leadership domain at societal level, and organisational level, which is subcategorized into culture and strategy. Building on the available opportunities and initiatives and on inspirational experiences of the limited number of women leaders in this field, recommendations for empowering and supporting womens leadership in conflict health are presented. METHODS: A desk-based literature review of academic and grey sources was conducted followed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: There is very limited evidence on women leaders in conflict and humanitarian health. Some data shows that women have leadership skills that help to support more inclusive solutions which are incredibly important in this sector. However, deeply imbedded discrimination against women at the organisational, cultural, social, financial and political levels is exacerbated in conflict which makes it more challenging for women to progress in such settings. CONCLUSION: Advocating for women leaders in conflict and health in the humanitarian sector, governmental bodies, academia and the global health community is crucial to increasing effective interventions that adequately address the complexity and diversity of humanitarian crises.","output":"Having more women humanitarian leaders will help transform the humanitarian system: challenges and opportunities for women leaders in conflict and humanitarian health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the liberalization of energy markets (especially electricity) by many countries has led to much attention being paid to their modeling. The energy market modeling under the framework of probability theory is valuable when the distribution function is close enough to the actual frequency. However, due to the complexity and variability of the world, economic reasons and changing government policies, this assumption is not applicable in some cases. Under such circumstances, we propose an uncertain two-factor model based on uncertain differential equations to evaluate the electricity spot price dynamics. Then, several essential indicators of electricity are investigated and generalized moment estimation for unknown parameters is also provided. Two case studies by using electricity data from the Oslo and Stockholm regions illustrate our approach. We also compare the proposed model with one-factor uncertain model driven by Liu process and the electricity stochastic model. A detailed numerical study illustrates the efficiency of the proposed model to evaluate electricity spot prices.","output":"Electricity spot price modeling by multi-factor uncertain process: a case study from the Nordic region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the status quo of engineering education, especially in highly interactive, hands-on design classes.

METHODS: We compared coronial autopsies (n=263) performed by one pathologist at a central London mortuary in the 1 year before and after 23 March 2020 by analysing their autopsy reports and coronial documentation. RESULTS: We have shown that there has been a significant increase of 70.5% (p=0.001) in the frequency of markedly decomposed bodies having coronial autopsies since the first lockdown. This is associated with a 38% increase (p=0.0001) in the rate of those dying at home and a 52.4% decrease (p=0.00003) in the rate of those dying in hospital who go on to have a coronial autopsy in our facility. Our results suggest that the most significant factor behind the increased frequency in advanced decomposition change since the first lockdown is this increase in coronial autopsies for deaths at home relative to deaths in hospital. CONCLUSION: Our results support the idea that perimortem social isolation will lead to an increased frequency of advanced decomposition changes seen at autopsy. We suggest that it could be possible to use the frequency of advanced postmortem decomposition change in a population as a surrogate marker for social isolation in future studies. Our study also illustrates a changing environment where the increasing prevalence of postmortem decomposition changes could affect the accuracy of autopsy reports and the medicolegal consequences thereof.","output":"Putrefaction in the pandemic: a comparative study of the frequency of advanced decomposition change in coronial autopsies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with dysphagia do not always present with subjective symptoms. However, asymptomatic dysphagia can also cause clinical issues, especially in those with respiratory conditions. Therefore, adequate screening is an essential beginning to their care. The repetitive saliva swallowing test (RSST) is one of the safest screening methods for dysphagia; it can be easily performed by nonprofessionals in any setting. There is evidence of its predictive values in aspiration pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), artificial ventilation, and other conditions. Additionaly, it has recently been found to be a strong predictor of the risk of future COPD exacerbation. The cost-effectiveness, harmlessness, and simplicity make it an optimal screening method for the large population of patients with respiratory conditions, although different cutoff values may be useful in different populations. It also takes into account multiple aspects of the swallowing ability, such as respiration, musculature, cognition, and general well-being.","output":"Predictive Roles of the Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST) in Aspiration Pneumonia and Other Respiratory Diseases: Does the RSST Have a Predictive Role in Aspiration Pneumonia and Other Respiratory Diseases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Compare a telephone version and full version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). METHODS Cross-sectional analysis of a prospective study. A 20-point telephone version of MoCA (Tele-MoCA) was compared to the Full-MoCA and Mini Mental State Examination. RESULTS Total of 140 participants enrolled. Mean scores for language were significantly lower with Tele-MoCA than with Full-MoCA (P = .003). Mean Tele-MoCA scores were significantly higher for participants with over 12 years of education (P < .001). Cutoff score of 17 for the Tele-MoCA yielded good specificity (82.2%) and negative predictive value (84.4%), while sensitivity was low (18.2%). CONCLUSIONS Remote screening of cognition with a 20-point Tele-MoCA is as specific for defining normal cognition as the Full-MoCA. This study shows that telephone evaluation is adequate for virtual cognitive screening. Our sample did not allow accurate assessment of sensitivity for Tele-MoCA in detecting MCI or dementia.

This health crisis has put an enormous amount of pressure on the global community, and this is especially true for our clients who are new immigrants. This pressure has manifested in mental health challenges. Social workers have reported that for many clients the uncertainty and pressure are becoming too much to handle. Typically, clients are experiencing anxiety, depression, substance use disorder, and in some cases interpersonal violence (Brodhead, 2020;Endale et al. 2020;Saltzman et al.,2020). Now imagine the impact on unaccompanied minors arriving at our borders. Prior to the pandemic, the unaccompanied children were dealing with three crises simultaneously: 1) parental and home country separation;2) trauma from a harsh journey;and 3) language barrier and cultural shock. These issues alone are overwhelming and cause powerful emotions such as anxiety in these children. So how can these emotions be managed, coupled with the dangers of COVID-19? How can social workers provide comfort and support when they may be experiencing the same emotions?

Three experimental studies were conducted using online consumer samples. The studies found that low levels of expected interaction through technology-mediated systems lead to low levels of perceived health risk. Perceived health risk mediates the relationship between expected interaction and hotel booking intention. In addition, high levels of expected cleanliness through advanced cleaning technologies moderate the impacts of expected interaction on perceived health risk. Importantly, the proposed perceived risk mechanism was effective in post-pandemic scenarios.

Some faced severe respiratory failure but were not eligible for invasive mechanical ventilation, due to frailty, functional status, comorbidity or wish of the patient. Our main objective was to investigate whether High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) treatment on the wards could be an effective alternative treatment for these patients. Methods: : A retrospective cohort study amongst COVID-19 adult patients with respiratory failure defined as persisting hypoxemia despite maximum conventional oxygen administration requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) but being treated with HFNC as they were non-eligible due to frailty or wish of the patient. Results: : The study included 32 patients between March 9 th and May 1 st , 2020. The median age was 79.0 years (74.5-83.0) with a median of three comorbidities (3-4) and a median Clinical Frailty Score of 4 out of 9 (3-6). The median SpO2/FiO2 Ratio was 157.5 indicating moderate ARDS. Overall survival rate in the HFNC cohort was 25%.

Only alpha- and betacoronaviruses have been observed to infect humans. Past outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both betacoronavirus, are the result of a spillover from animals. Recently, a new strain termed SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Severe cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). One contributor to the development of ARDS is cytokine storm, an overwhelming inflammatory immune response. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are genetic regulatory elements that, among many functions, alter gene expression and cellular processes. lncRNAs identified to be pertinent in COVID-19 cytokine storm have the potential to serve as disease markers or drug targets. This project aims to computationally identify conserved lncRNAs potentially regulating gene expression in cytokine storm during COVID-19. We found 22 lncRNAs that can target 10 cytokines overexpressed in COVID-19 cytokine storm, 8 of which targeted two or more cytokine storm cytokines. In particular, the lncRNA non-coding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD), targeted five out of the ten identified cytokine storm cytokines, and is evolutionarily conserved across multiple species. These lncRNAs are ideal candidates for further in vitro and in vivo analysis.","output":"Evolutionarily Conserved Long Non-coding RNA Regulates Gene Expression in Cytokine Storm During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: World Health Organisation (WHO) has approved and recommended several public health measures to halt the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The study aimed to identify the workable community-based interventions being utilised in LMICs. Main body We applied systematic review approach for this study. Included articles were searched in eight online databases. The analysis was guided by the acceptable of best practice developed by the PROSPERO and COCHRANE for systematic search and selection of articles using pre-defined search terms. Furthermore, a PRISMA flow diagram was used to show the number of articles retrieved, retained, excluded with rationales given for every action. Studies conducted on community-based intervention for preventing COVID-19 and levels of knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) on community-based intervention for preventing COVID-19 regardless of the design were included. A mixed method appraisal tool (MMAT) was used to appraise studies.Six studies from LMICs were included for detail analysis after the systematic review screening process from 10,100 articles. The quality assessment using MMAT tool appraised these articles were all in highest quality. Among the six articles, 10 community-based interventions were implemented in LMICs. The three key workable and implemented interventions are: use of masks, social distance and hand wash. The review identified varying levels of KAP between LMICs and social-demographical factors affecting KAP in these settings. Conclusion: This systematic review has identified the community-based interventions implemented in LMICs to prevent COVID-19 during the pandemic and key factors affecting the level of KAP among the population. This study re-affirms the importance of effective and suitable implementation of the identified interventions.

TNF stimulation leads to the formation of two distinct signalling complexes, a well-defined membrane bound complex (complex 1), and a less well characterised cytosolic death inducing complex (complex 2). Using mass spectrometry, we identified the ADP-ribosyltransferase, tankyrase-1 (TNKS1/TNKS/ARTD5/PARP5a) as a novel native complex 2 component. Following a TNF-induced death stimulus TNKS1 is recruited to complex 2, resulting in complex 2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). Tankyrase inhibitors sensitise cells to TNF-induced death, which is correlated with increased complex 2 assembly. Tankyrase-mediated PARylation promotes recruitment of the E3 ligase RNF146 and RNF146 deficiency or proteasome inhibition results in increased levels of complex 2, suggesting that RNF146 causes proteasomal degradation of complex 2. Several viruses express ADP-ribose binding macrodomain proteins, and expression of the SARS-CoV-2 or VEEV macrodomain markedly sensitises cells to TNF-induced death. This suggests that ADP-ribosylation serves as yet another mechanism to detect pathogenic interference of TNF signalling and retaliate with an inflammatory cell death.","output":"Tankyrase-mediated ADP-ribosylation is a novel regulator of TNF-induced death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies of proteinaceous cysteine protease inhibitors originated with the discovery of cystatins in the 1960s.

SARS-CoV-2 has been found to cause multiple organ damage; however, little attention has been paid to the damage to the endocrine system caused by this virus, and the subsequent impact on prognosis. This may be the first research on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, 235 patients were admitted to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 22 January to 17 March 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and treatments were obtained from electronic medical records with standard data collection forms and compared among patients with different thyroid function status. RESULTS: Among 235 patients, 17 (7.23%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 11 (4.68%) severe non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), and 23 (9.79%) mild to moderate NTIS. Composite endpoint events of each group, including mortality, admission to the ICU, and using IMV were observed. Compared with normal thyroid function, the hazard ratios (HRs) of composite endpoint events for mild to moderate NTIS, severe NTIS, subclinical hypothyroidism were 27.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.07C105.7), 23.1 (95% CI 5.75C92.8), and 4.04 (95% CI 0.69C23.8) respectively.

The numbers of cases and deaths have increased on a daily basis on the scale of a global pandemic. Chest X-ray images have proven useful for monitoring various lung diseases and have recently been used to monitor the COVID-19 disease. In this paper, deep-learning-based approaches, namely deep feature extraction, fine-tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN), and end-to-end training of a developed CNN model, have been used in order to classify COVID-19 and normal (healthy) chest X-ray images. For deep feature extraction, pretrained deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19) were used. For classification of the deep features, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier was used with various kernel functions, namely Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and Gaussian. The aforementioned pretrained deep CNN models were also used for the fine-tuning procedure. A new CNN model is proposed in this study with end-to-end training. A dataset containing 180 COVID-19 and 200 normal (healthy) chest X-ray images was used in the study's experimentation. Classification accuracy was used as the performance measurement of the study. The experimental works reveal that deep learning shows potential in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images. The deep features extracted from the ResNet50 model and SVM classifier with the Linear kernel function produced a 94.7% accuracy score, which was the highest among all the obtained results. The achievement of the fine-tuned ResNet50 model was found to be 92.6%, whilst end-to-end training of the developed CNN model produced a 91.6% result.

METHODS Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection were identified at two affiliated hospitals in New York City from March 13 to April 19, 2020, for this case series study. Women were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection based on either universal testing on admission or testing because of COVID-19-related symptoms. Disease was classified as either 1) asymptomatic or mild or 2) moderate or severe based on dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxia. Clinical and demographic risk factors for moderate or severe disease were analyzed and calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Laboratory findings and associated symptoms were compared between those with mild or asymptomatic and moderate or severe disease. The clinical courses and associated complications of women hospitalized with moderate and severe disease are described. RESULTS Of 158 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, 124 (78%) had mild or asymptomatic disease and 34 (22%) had moderate or severe disease. Of 15 hospitalized women with moderate or severe disease, 10 received respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and one required intubation. Women with moderate or severe disease had a higher likelihood of having an underlying medical comorbidity (50% vs 27%, OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26-6.02). Asthma was more common among those with moderate or severe disease (24% vs 8%, OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.26-9.75). Women with moderate or severe disease were significantly more likely to have leukopenia and elevated aspartate transaminase and ferritin. Women with moderate or severe disease were at significantly higher risk for cough and chest pain and pressure. Nine women received ICU or step-down-level care, including four for 9 days or longer. Two women underwent preterm delivery because their clinical status deteriorated. CONCLUSION One in five pregnant women who contracted COVID-19 infection developed moderate or severe disease, including a small proportion with prolonged critical illness who received ICU or step-down-level care.","output":"Symptoms and Critical Illness Among Obstetric Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: One of the clear effects of the spread of the Covid-19 virus on educational work is the shift to remote teaching and assessment. Since the switch to remote exams, it became clear that the biggest challenge facing electronic exams is the spread of academic dishonesty to the extent that it has become a concern for teachers, educators, officials and parents. The preoccupation of these individuals became the need to search for what would put an end to this problem.Objective: This research aims to shed light on the open book exams that can contribute to reducing this problem. It also aims to show the role of the open book exam in reducing academic dishonesty in electronic exams.Methodology: In the methodology, the rapid review method was done for collecting data. Papers were then categorized and analyzed to realize the goals of this research.Results: It has been found that electronic exams suffer from an outbreak of academic dishonesty. And the use of the open book exam, especially the one that is built in a sound way, reduces the phenomenon of academic dishonesty.Conclusion: The use of open book exams contributes positively to the reduction of academic dishonesty provided that the exam is designed and built appropriately and both the lecturer and the student are well trained to use this type of exam. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Combating Academic Dishonesty in Higher Education Exams during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Open Book Exams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic forced most countries to put in place lockdown measures to slow down the transmission of the virus. These lockdowns have led to temporal improvements in air quality. Here, we evaluate the changes in NO2 and O3 levels along with the associated impact upon premature mortality during the COVID-19 lockdown and deconfinement periods along the first epidemic wave across the provincial capital cities of Spain. We first quantify the change in pollutants solely due to the lockdown as the difference between business-as-usual (BAU) pollution levels, estimated with a machine learning-based meteorological normalization technique, and observed concentrations. Second, instead of using exposure-response functions between the pollutants and mortality reported in the literature, we fit conditional quasi-Poisson regression models to estimate city-specific associations between daily pollutant levels and non-accidental mortality during the period 2010-2018. Significant relative risk values are observed at lag 1 for NO2 (1.0047 [95% CI: 1.0014 to 1.0081]) and at lag 0 for O3 (1.0039 [1.0013 to 1.0065]). On average NO2 changed by -51% (intercity range -65.7 to -30.9%) and -36.4% (-53.7 to -11.6%), and O3 by -1.1% (-20.2 to 23.8%) and 0.6% (-12.4 to 23.0%), during the lockdown (57 days) and deconfinement (42 days) periods, respectively. We obtain a reduction in attributable mortality associated with NO2 changes of -119 (95% CI: -273 to -24) deaths over the lockdown, and of -53 (-114 to -10) deaths over the deconfinement. This was partially compensated by an increase in the attributable number of deaths, 14 (-72 to 99) during the lockdown, and 8 (-27 to 50) during the deconfinement, associated with the rise in O3 levels in the most populous cities during the analysed period, despite the overall small average reductions.

This peculiarity of the algorithm means that even in the early stages of an epidemic process, when the data are too few to have sufficient statistics, it is possible to obtain important information. To prove our theory, we addressed one of the most central issues at the moment: the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the cases recorded in Italy have been selected. Italy seems to have a central role in this epidemic because of the high number of measured infections. Through this innovative artificial intelligence algorithm, we have tried to analyze the evolution of the phenomenon and to predict its future steps using a dataset that contained only geospatial coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the first recorded cases. Once the coordinates of the places where at least one case of contagion had been officially diagnosed until February 26th, 2020 had been collected, research and analysis was carried out on: outbreak point and related heat map (TWC alpha); probability distribution of the contagion on February 26th (TWC beta); possible spread of the phenomenon in the immediate future and then in the future of the future (TWC gamma and TWC theta); how this passage occurred in terms of paths and mutual influence (Theta paths and Markov Machine).

In order to keep education running, educational institutions have had to quickly adapt to the situation. This has resulted in an unprecedented push to online learning. Many, including commercial digital learning platform providers, have rushed to provide their support and solutions, sometimes for free. The Covid-19 pandemic has therefore also created a sellers market in ed-tech. This paper employs a critical lens to reflect on the possible problems arising from hasty adoption of commercial digital learning solutions whose design might not always be driven by best pedagogical practices but their business model that leverages user data for profit-making. Moreover, already before Covid-19, there has been increasing critique of how ed-tech is redefining and reducing concepts of teaching and learning. The paper also challenges the narrative that claims, education is broken, and it should and can be fixed with technology. Such technologization, often seen as neutral, is closely related to educationalization, i.e. imposing growing societal problems for education to resolve. Therefore, this is a critical moment to reflect how the current choices educational institutions are making might affect with Covid-19 education and online learning: Will they reinforce capitalist instrumental view of education or promote holistic human growth?

This study aimed to explore the prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 and to examine whether cancer patients with COVID-19 may be at an increased risk of severe illness and mortality. Methods: A comprehensive electronic search in seven databases was performed, to identified studies reporting the prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients, or providing data of cancer between patients with severe or non-severe illness or between non-survivors and survivors. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled prevalence and odds risk (OR) using the inverse variance method with the random-effects model. Results: Thirty-four studies with 8080 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 was 2.0% (95% CI: 2.0% to 3.0%). The prevalence in Italy (5.0%), France (6.0%), and Korea (4.0%) were higher than that in China (2.0%).

In light of social distancing measures, and in particular physical distancing because of lockdown policies, the use of digital technologies has been regarded as the alternative to maintain economic and social activities. This paper aims to describe the design and implementation of an online survey created as an urgent, international response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The online survey described here responds to the need of understanding the effects of the pandemic on social interactions/relations and to provide findings on the extent to which digital technology is being utilized by citizens across different communities and countries around the world. It also aims to analyze the association of use of digital technologies with psychological well-being and levels of loneliness. The data will be based on the ongoing survey (comprised of several existing and validated instruments on digital use, psychological well-being and loneliness), open for 3 months after roll out (ends September) across 11 countries (Austria, France, Germany, India, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Turkey, and UK).

STUDY DESIGN: Designed in conjunction with the local arts centre and the psychology team at the University of Dundee, the art boxes were a response to planned face-to-face art interventions with families being cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions. The aim of the art boxes is to encourage parents to make art together with their infants, fostering connection through playful, creative shared experiences. This research is currently being expanded to reach out to new families through referrals from health visitors, family nurses, and charity partners. METHODS: Data is being collected on how the art boxes are experienced by families using a mixed-methods approach. Families complete feedback cards (online, or using the stamped addressed card included in the box) rating their experience on quantitative scales and providing open comments. Visual data are gathered through parents sharing images with us on social media. An initial sample of 10 participants has been interviewed using semistructured interviews, allowing more in-depth qualitative understanding of their experiences. These preliminary findings are discussed here. RESULTS: The thematic analysis of initial interviews provided a rich picture of the disconnection families experienced during lockdown, why art boxes may be beneficial to parental well-being, and the mechanisms by which the boxes may help to develop connections for the parent and infant together. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings show parents reporting feeling more confident and undertaking new activities which they plan to continue. This was of particular importance during lockdown where parents report opportunities for different experiences being more limited. Parent's describe positive playful interactions and reported improvements to their own well-being from doing creative activities together with their child.

METHODS Randomized controlled trials of treatment-resistant pneumonia searched on PubMed, Embase, and other websites before December 31, 2020 were collected. Literature was selected by inclusion and exclusion criteria. Bias risk was assessed using Cochrane intervention system Review manual 5.0.2 and Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS A total of 6 articles meeting the requirements were included, comprising 796 participants. The results of meta-analysis showed that the clinical efficacy [odds ratio (OR) =3.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-12.99; Z=2.13; P =0.03] and white blood cell counts [mean difference (MD) =0.55; 95% CI: -0.57 to 1.67; Z=0.96; P=0.34] of patients both increased.

In particular, survivors of critical illness have significantly elevated risk of developing lasting cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we examine the role of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids in neuropsychiatric outcomes following critical illness. Illness is marked by acute elevation of free cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) suppression, which typically normalize after recovery; however, prolonged dysregulation can sometimes occur. High glucocorticoid levels can cause lasting alterations to the plasticity and structural integrity of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and this mechanism may plausibly contribute to impaired memory and cognition in critical illness survivors, though specific evidence is lacking. Glucocorticoids may also exacerbate inflammation-associated neural damage. Conversely, current evidence indicates that glucocorticoids during illness may protect against the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We propose future directions for research in this field, including determining the role of persistent glucocorticoid elevations after illness in neuropsychiatric outcomes, the role of systemic vs. neuroinflammation, and probing unexplored lines of investigation on the role of mineralocorticoid receptors and the gut-brain axis. Progress toward personalized medicine in this area has the potential to produce tangible improvements to the lives patients after a critical illness, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"Glucocorticoids and the brain after critical illness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online food delivery service (OFDS) has been widely utilized during the new normal of COVID-19 pandemic especially in a developing country such as Indonesia.

Of these, the COVID-19 pandemic has had by far the greatest health and economic consequences. During these emergencies, responses taken by one country often have an impact on other countries. The implication is that coordination between countries is likely to achieve better outcomes, individually and collectively, than each country independently pursuing its own self-interest. During the COVID-19 pandemic, gaps in multilateral cooperation on research and information sharing, vaccine development and deployment, and travel policies have hampered the speed and equity of global recovery.

We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes. Results: Four respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%). There were modest declines in self-reported physical and mental health, and 48.2% did less physical activity. In multivariable regression models, adherence to guidance by leaving the house less often associated with less professional occupational class (OR=0.71, 95%CI 0.51-0.98) and poorer self-rated general health (OR=0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92).

CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old man, after 13 days from the first administration of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca), presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomitus. Laboratory tests revealed a severe thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen serum levels and marked increase of D-dimer serum levels. The patient quickly developed a multiple organ failure, till death, three days after the hospital admission. RESULTS: At histology, in the lungs, interalveolar septa appeared thickened with microthrombi in the capillaries and veins. Interalveolar septa appeared thickened and showed vascular proliferation. Thrombi were detected in the capillaries of glomerular tufts. In the hearth, thrombi were observed in veins and capillaries. In the liver, voluminous fibrin thrombi were diffusely observed in the branches of the portal vein. Microthrombi were also found in the vasa vasorum of the wall of abdominal aorta.

The expansion of telehealth services is expected to deliver timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients while minimizing exposure in health care facilities, to protect health care providers and other patients. However, it is currently unknown whether US hospitals have the telehealth capacity to meet the increasing demand and needs of patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the population-level internet search volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new COVID-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in all US states. METHODS: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first COVID-19 case was reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on COVID-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center. We also used data from the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey to estimate the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (including telemedicine and electronic visits) and those with the capability of telemedicine intensive care unit (tele-ICU). Pearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States during the study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-ICU capabilities. RESULTS: We found that US population-level interest in telehealth increased as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, with a strong correlation (r=0.948, P<.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was higher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (r=0.055, P=.70) nor hospitals having tele-ICU capability (r=-0.073, P=.61). CONCLUSIONS: As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, so does the US population's interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals providing telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity. Telecommunication infrastructures in US hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing health care needs of patients with other health conditions. More practical investment is needed to deploy the telehealth system rapidly against the impending patient surge.","output":"Population-Level Interest and Telehealth Capacity of US Hospitals in Response to COVID-19: Cross-Sectional Analysis of Google Search and National Hospital Survey Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanomedicine is a speedily growing area of medical research that is focused on developing nanomaterials for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases.

In this study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the ureteral stone presentations in a high-volume university hospital during the COVID-19 restrictions order period. MATERIAL AND METHODS The data of 149 patients who were hospitalized due to ureteral stone both during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions period and the corresponding period (non-COVID-19) of the previous year were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Unpaired Student's t test was used to compare continuous variables. The categorical data were assessed using a chi-square test. RESULTS Of 149 patients, 35 were hospitalized in the COVID-19 period. While the mean age and the stone characteristics of the two groups did not differ significantly, serum creatinine levels (1.9?1.85 vs 1.15?0.64) and the white blood cell counts (12.45?6.54 vs 8.21?4.15) at hospital admission were significantly higher in the COVID-period group (p=0.034 and p=0.005, respectively). According to the priority classification of the European Urology Guidelines Office Rapid Reaction Group Urolithiasis Guidelines Panel applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant difference was observed between the two periods (X2=9.907, p=0.019). In particular, the rate of emergency cases was found more than 3-fold in the COVID-19 period.

These results are important indicators that can become decision drivers for future policies and strategies in industrial and logistics activities (including the mobility sector) aimed at their environmental sustainability. The scenario imposed by COVID-19 has supported the understanding of the link between the reduction of polluting emissions and the state of air quality and will be able to support strategic choices for the future sustainable growth of the industrial and logistics sector.","output":"How changes in human activities during the lockdown impacted air quality parameters: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunosuppressed patients like patients with leukemia or lymphoma, but also patients after autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation are at particular risk for an infection with COVID\\\\19.

Glucocorticoid use during pregnancy is a common treatment for asthma, allergies, and COVID-19. Several studies have reported adverse effects including intrauterine growth restriction as a result of glucocorticoid exposure, yet little is known about the mechanisms by which short and long-term maternal glucocorticoid exposures affect placental biology and fetal development. To better understand the role of glucocorticoids on placental and fetal outcomes, we used a mouse model exposed to the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex), prior to and throughout gestation. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in mice with a treatment arm of Dex exposure and water exposure as control. Virgin C57Bl/6J female mice were single-housed at 11 weeks of age, and Dex was introduced in the drinking water as a 1mg/kg/day dose. After one week of treatment, mice were bred with age-matched virgin males. Dam body composition, food, and water intake were monitored weekly. Maternal insulin sensitivity, pup survival rate, litter size, and pup birth weight at postnatal day (PND) 0.5 were also assessed. Dams treated with Dex lost significant lean mass after one week of treatment. Dex treatment did not appear to affect the dams ability to get pregnant, as both groups carried pups to term with similar lengths of gestation (p=0.838). Water and Dex-treated dams gained comparable weight during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, however, the Dex group gained less lean mass than the water group during the third trimester. At PND0.5, Dex dams had fewer pups with a 40% reduction in litter size (p=0.01) and lighter pups with a 37% reduction in offspring weight (p&amp;lt;0.001), indicating substantial intrauterine growth restriction. All pups of Dex-treated dams died by PND1. Attempts to rescue pups of Dex-dams by cross-fostering with water-treated nursing dams or by feeding the pups 10% glucose at PND0.5 failed by PND1. These results demonstrate a novel finding regarding the chronic use of glucocorticoids before and during conception and pregnancy. The reduction in both pup weight and late-pregnancy maternal weight gain suggests potential growth restriction or placental insufficiency. Further molecular studies during multiple time points of gestation will help elucidate the mechanisms at play.","output":"Effects of Dexamethasone on Offspring Survival and Intrauterine Growth Restriction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Many people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are expected to self-manage their condition. Patient activation is the term given to describe the knowledge, skills, and confidence a person has in managing their own health and is closely related to the engagement in preventive health behaviors. Self-management interventions have the potential to improve remote disease management and health outcomes. We are testing an evidence- and theory-based digital self-management structured 10-week programme developed for CKD patients called \\"My Kidneys & Me\\". The primary aim of the study (SMILE-K) is to assess the effect on patient activation levels. Methods and analysis A single-blind randomised control trial (RCT) with a nested pilot study will assess the feasibility of the intervention and study design before continuation to a full RCT. Individuals aged 18 years or older, with established CKD stage 3-4 (eGFR of 15-59 ml/min/1.73m2) will be recruited through both primary and secondary care pathways. Participants will be randomised into two groups: intervention group and control group. The primary outcome is the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13). The full RCT will assess the effect of the programme on online self-reported outcomes which will be assessed at baseline, after 10-weeks, and then after 20-weeks in both groups. A total sample size of n=432 participants are required based on a 2:1 randomisation.

As the prognosis of PCa continues to improve, the increasing follow-up requirements after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy puts significant pressure on health care systems. Follow-up is typically conducted by treating urologists, specialized nurses, or general practitioners. Despite the increase in patient numbers, resources are not likely to increase in proportion. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in our thinking towards telehealth solutions, primarily to avoid or limit physical contact and to spare resources. Here we report our novel telehealth solution for PCa follow-up, called Mobile PSA. Currently, more than 4500 PCa patients have been using Mobile PSA follow-up in our center. Mobile PSA can increase follow-up accuracy, as all biochemical relapses will be detected in a timely manner, can significantly reduce delays in reporting prostate-specific antigen results to patients, and can significantly reduce costs.

This article examines Poetry in Motion as a useful miniature portrait of recent evolutions in American poetic culture, focusing on its most long-standing instantiation in New York City and drawing on scholarship on American verse-reading practices and on interviews with program officials. By doing so, it argues that Poetry in Motion has since its origins served conflicting aims: in certain ways bolstering the authorizing force of official verse culture and subtly propagating conservative interpretative practices, yet also advocating ever more diverse poets and allowing readers to engage their work subversively. To attain those unstated goals that are sometimes in tension, the program overtly frames featured poems in ways that encourage old-fashioned lyric reading practices mirroring those still disseminated in many classrooms. However, Poetry in Motion also increasingly acknowledges readers' agency, which makes it unlikely those will be the only approaches applied. Its contours thereby elucidate how all institutions of verse culture have evolved in recent decades, whether willingly or begrudgingly.

METHOD: A multicentre prospective study on 138 coronavirus disease 2019 patients was conducted. Olfactory and gustatory functions were prospectively evaluated for 60 days. RESULTS: Within the first 4 days of coronavirus disease 2019, 84.8 per cent of patients had chemosensitive dysfunction that gradually improved over the observation period. The most significant increase in chemosensitive scores occurred in the first 10 days for taste and between 10 and 20 days for smell. At the end of the observation period (60 days after symptom onset), 7.2 per cent of the patients still had severe dysfunctions. The risk of developing a long-lasting disorder becomes significant at 10 days for taste (odds ratio = 40.2, 95 per cent confidence interval = 2.204C733.2, p = 0.013) and 20 days for smell (odds ratio = 58.5, 95 per cent confidence interval = 3.278C1043.5, p = 0.005).

The concomitant presence of co-morbidities like chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, chronic heart disease etc. makes the task of patient management difficult. AIMS AND OBJECTIVESTo assess the patterns of liver test abnormalities in patients of COVID-19 infection with and without CKD and evaluate the probable outcomes. MATERIALs and METHODSA cross-sectional retrospective observational study done on 600 patient samples (Group 1 COVID-19 without CKD, Group 2 COVID-19 with CKD and Group 3 non COVID-19 with CKD) which were processed for Liver function test (AST, ALT and ALP) and Renal function test (Urea and Creatinine) in the Department of Biochemistry, Dr. RML Hospital New Delhi. RESULTSAST and ALT levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in all COVID-19 positive patients - group 1 mean {+/-} 2 SD, (63.63 {+/-} 42.89 U/L & 50.25 {+/-} 46.53 U/L respectively) and group 2 (90.59 {+/-} 62.51 U/L & 72.09 {+/-} 67.24 U/L respectively) as compared to Group 3 (25.24 {+/-} 7.47 U/L & 24.93 {+/-} 11.44 U/L respectively) and also a statistically significant elevation is seen in these two parameters (AST & ALT) in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (P < 0.05). There was a negative significant correlation between eGFR and AST/ALT levels in Group 1 (p < 0.05). In Group 2, a weak positive correlation was seen with ALT (p < 0.01). No significant correlation existed between eGFR and ALP in groups 1 and 2. In Group 3, eGFRs showed strong correlations with AST and ALT levels (p < 0.01) and reduction in kidney function correlated well with increase in serum ALP levels, (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONSThis study most comprehensively describes that SARS-CoV-2 positive CKD patients show more elevations in serum aminotransferase levels as compared to their non-CKD counterparts, in contrast to non-COVID-19 CKD cases. Serum ALT values in SARS-CoV-2 patients show significant correlation with calculated eGFR values. Elevated ALP values in CKD patients may be used as an indicator of declining kidney function.

METHODS After composition of the research group, a Delphi consensus was initiated to identify and rate all features, which may be relevant to assess UIAs and their treatment by using ranking scales and analysis of inter-rater agreement (IRA) for each factor. IRA was categorized as very high, high, moderate, or low. RESULTS Ultimately, 39 specialists from 4 specialties agreed (high or very high IRAs) on the following key factors for or against UIA treatment decisions: (1) patient age, life expectancy, and comorbid diseases; (2) previous subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm, family history for UIA or subarachnoid hemorrhage, nicotine use; (3) UIA size, location, and lobulation; (4) UIA growth or de novo formation on serial imaging; (5) clinical symptoms (cranial nerve deficit, mass effect, and thromboembolic events from UIAs); and (6) risk factors for UIA treatment (patient age and life expectancy, UIA size, and estimated risk of treatment). However, IRAs for features rated with low relevance were also generally low, which underlined the existing controversy about the natural history of UIAs. CONCLUSIONS Our results highlight that neurovascular specialists currently consider many features as important when evaluating UIAs but also highlight that the appreciation of natural history of UIAs remains uncertain, even within a group of highly informed individuals.","output":"Multidisciplinary consensus on assessment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: proposal of an international research group."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed routine care practice for older persons, especially in those with frailty living in long term care (LTC) facilities.

The identification of novel spike gene mutations appearing in minks has raised major concerns about potential immune evasion and challenges for the global vaccine strategy.

However, biolayer interferometry analysis demonstrates that it binds the human ACE-2 receptor with a four-fold higher affinity compared to the original strain suggesting an enhanced transmission capacity and a possible challenge for viral control. These results also indicate that the rise in frequency of the cluster-five variant in mink farms might be a result of the fitness advantage conferred by the receptor adaptation rather than evading immune responses.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Y453F mink variant displays a pronounced increase in ACE-2 affinity but does not challenge antibody neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Well-established mortality ratio methodology can contribute to a fuller picture of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 burden of disease by revealing trends and informing mitigation strategies.

We analysed standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) comparing 2020 with 2016-2019 as reference years with a focus on trend detection. RESULTS In Germany as a whole, elevated mortality in April (most pronounced for Bavaria) declined in May. The states of Hamburg and Bremen had increased SMRs in all months under study. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, decreased SMRs in January turned monotonically to increased SMRs by June. Irrespective of age group, this trend was pronounced and significant. CONCLUSIONS Increased SMRs in Hamburg and Bremen must be interpreted with caution because of potential upward distortions due to a \\"catchment bias\\". A pronounced excess mortality in April across Germany was confirmed and a hitherto undetected trend of increasing SMRs for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania was revealed. To meet the pandemic challenge and to benefit from research based on data collected in standardized ways, national authorities should regularly conduct SMR analyses.

This systematic review aimed to examine best practices, identify common pitfalls in tobacco control PSMs and propose a modelling quality assessment framework. METHODS We searched five databases to identify eligible publications from July 2013 to August 2019. We additionally included papers from Feirman et al for studies before July 2013. Tobacco control PSMs that project tobacco use and tobacco-related outcomes from smoking policies were included. We extracted model inputs, structure and outputs data for models used in two or more included papers. Using our proposed quality assessment framework, we scored these models on population representativeness, policy effectiveness evidence, simulated smoking histories, included smoking-related diseases, exposure-outcome lag time, transparency, sensitivity analysis, validation and equity. FINDINGS We found 146 eligible papers and 25 distinct models. Most models used population data from public or administrative registries, and all performed sensitivity analysis. However, smoking behaviour was commonly modelled into crude categories of smoking status. Eight models only presented overall changes in mortality rather than explicitly considering smoking-related diseases. Only four models reported impacts on health inequalities, and none offered the source code. Overall, the higher scored models achieved higher citation rates. CONCLUSIONS While fragments of good practices were widespread across the reviewed PSMs, only a few included a 'critical mass' of the good practices specified in our quality assessment framework.

Yet, in contrast to studies of single substances, little is known about patterns of polysubstance use in this population. Moreover, other risk factors (e.g., financial hardship, incarceration, homelessness, and mental health distress) are also prevalent and complicate HIV management. The present study drew on a cross-sectional survey with African American/Black and Latino (AABL) adult PLWH from low socioeconomic status backgrounds in New York City who were insufficiently engaged in HIV care and evidenced detectable HIV viral load (N = 512). We used latent class analysis (LCA) to explore patterns of polysubstance use and their relationships to financial hardship, incarceration, homelessness, and mental health. LCA yielded three substance use classes: Class 1, a high polysubstance use/high-risk substance use class (9%); Class 2, a polysubstance use/moderate substance use risk class (18%); and Class 3, a moderate polysubstance use/moderate-to-low-risk substance use class (74%). Mental health symptoms were prevalent in all classes, but Class 1 had greater mental health distress than the other two classes. Current homelessness was more prevalent in Classes 1 and 2.

The underlying mechanism of COVAN is unknown. We hypothesized that cytokines induced by COVID-19 trigger expression of pathogenic APOL1 via JAK-STAT signaling, resulting in podocyte loss and COVAN phenotype. Here, based on nine biopsy-proven COVAN cases, we demonstrated for the first time that APOL1 protein is abundantly expressed in podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) of COVAN kidneys but not in controls. Moreover, a majority (77.8%) of COVAN patients carried two APOL1 risk alleles. We showed that recombinant cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 act synergistically to drive APOL1 expression through the JAK-STAT pathway in primary human podocytes, GECs, and kidney micro-organoids derived from a carrier of two APOL1 risk alleles but was blocked by JAK1/2-inhibitor, baricitinib.

Rapidly designing, manufacturing and distributing nAbs requires significant planning across the product value chain and an understanding of the opportunities, challenges and risks throughout. Methods: A systems framework comprised of four critical components is presented to aid in developing effective end-to-end nAbs strategies in the context of a pandemic: (1) product design and optimization, (2) epidemiology, (3) demand and (4) supply. Quantitative models are used to estimate product demand using available epidemiological data, simulate biomanufacturing operations from typical bioprocess parameters and calculate antibody production costs to meet clinical needs under various realistic scenarios. Results: In a US-based case study during the 9-month period from March 15 to December 15, 2020, the projected number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 15.73 million. The estimated product volume needed to meet therapeutic demand for the maximum number of clinically eligible patients ranged between 6.3 and 31.5 tons for 0.5 and 2.5 g dose sizes, respectively. The relative production scale and cost needed to meet demand are calculated for different centralized and distributed manufacturing scenarios. Conclusions: Meeting demand for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs requires significant manufacturing capacity and planning for appropriate administration in clinical settings.

We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged &#8805;20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 57% (95% CI 51-64) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 149% (132-169) by Jan 15, 2021. With 265% (234-298) of adult residents having been infected in ?le-de-France (Paris region) compared with 51% (45-58) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 050) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 074). The proportion infected was twice as high (204%, 156-263) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (97%, 69-141). 402% (343-463) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 493% (429-559) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 089).

The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be the major inhibitor of interferon production in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with the host mRNA export factors Rae1 and Nup98. Here, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 strongly represses protein expression of co-transfected reporter constructs and imprisons host mRNA in the nucleus, which is associated with its ability to co-purify with Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C-terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. We further identify an ORF6 mutant containing a 9-amino acid deletion, ORF6 {Delta}22-30, in multiple SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates that can still downregulate the expression of a co-transfected reporter and interact with Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and pre-symptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. ImportanceSARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. One of SARS-CoV-2s accessory proteins, ORF6, was recently shown to co-purify with two host proteins, Rae1 and Nup98, involved in mRNA nuclear export. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 interaction with these proteins is associated with reduced expression of a reporter protein and accumulation of poly-A mRNA within the nucleus. SARS-CoV ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 to more strongly disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport than SARS-CoV ORF6 may partially explain critical differences in clinical presentation between the two viruses.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport through interactions with Rae1 and Nup98"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the article is to understand the need and importance of risk communication and community engagement in containing the COVID-19 outbreak.

A general consensus is that all sources of data should be embraced to improve epidemic preparedness. As a disease transmission is inherently governed by individual-level responses, pathogen dynamics within infected hosts posit high potentials to inform population-level phenomena. We propose a multiscale approach showing that individual dynamics were able to reproduce population-level observations. METHODS: Using experimental data, we formulated mathematical models of pathogen infection dynamics from which we simulated mechanistically its transmission parameters. The models were then embedded in our implementation of an age-specific contact network that allows to express individual differences relevant to the transmission processes. This approach is illustrated with an example of Ebola virus (EBOV). RESULTS: The results showed that a within-host infection model can reproduce EBOVs transmission parameters obtained from population data. At the same time, population age-structure, contact distribution and patterns can be expressed using network generating algorithm. This framework opens a vast opportunity to investigate individual roles of factors involved in the epidemic processes. Estimating EBOVs reproduction number revealed a heterogeneous pattern among age-groups, prompting cautions on estimates unadjusted for contact pattern. Assessments of mass vaccination strategies showed that vaccination conducted in a time window from five months before to one week after the start of an epidemic appeared to strongly reduce epidemic size. Noticeably, compared to a non-intervention scenario, a low critical vaccination coverage of 33% cannot ensure epidemic extinction but could reduce the number of cases by ten to hundred times as well as lessen the case-fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental data on the within-host infection have been able to capture upfront key transmission parameters of a pathogen; the applications of this approach will give us more time to prepare for potential epidemics. The population of interest in epidemic assessments could be modelled with an age-specific contact network without exhaustive amount of data. Further assessments and adaptations for different pathogens and scenarios to explore multilevel aspects in infectious diseases epidemics are underway.

However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. FINDINGS: The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 28 (95% HPDI 15-44) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. INTERPRETATION: Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

A well-known strategy to identify molecules with inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 proteins is repurposing clinically developed drugs, e.g., antiparasitic drugs. The results described in this study demonstrated the inhibitory potential of quinacrine and suramin against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro). Quinacrine and suramin molecules presented a competitive and noncompetitive inhibition mode, respectively, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrated that quinacrine and suramin alone possessed a moderate or weak affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro but suramin binding increased quinacrine interaction by around a factor of eight. Using docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we identified a possible binding mode and the amino acids involved in these interactions. Our results suggested that suramin, in combination with quinacrine, showed promising synergistic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. We suppose that the identification of effective, synergistic drug combinations could lead to the design of better treatments for the COVID-19 disease and repurposable drug candidates offer fast therapeutic breakthroughs, mainly in a pandemic moment.","output":"The Repurposed Drugs Suramin and Quinacrine Cooperatively Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurovirulent coronavirus that invades the central nervous system (CNS) in piglets. Although important progress has been made toward understanding the biology of PHEV, many aspects of its life cycle remain obscure. Here we dissected the molecular mechanism underlying cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of PHEV in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. We first performed a thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to characterize the kinetics of PHEV, and we found that viral entry and transfer occur via membranous coating-mediated endo- and exocytosis. To verify the roles of distinct endocytic pathways, systematic approaches were used, including pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference, confocal microscopy analysis, use of fluorescently labeled virus particles, and overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant. Quantification of infected cells showed that PHEV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and that low pH, dynamin, cholesterol, and Eps15 are indispensably involved in this process. Intriguingly, PHEV invasion leads to rapid actin rearrangement, suggesting that the intactness and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are positively correlated with viral endocytosis. We next investigated the trafficking of internalized PHEV and found that Rab5- and Rab7-dependent pathways are required for the initiation of a productive infection. Furthermore, a GTPase activation assay suggested that endogenous Rab5 is activated by PHEV and is crucial for viral progression. Our findings demonstrate that PHEV hijacks the CME and endosomal system of the host to enter and traffic within neural cells, providing new insights into PHEV pathogenesis and guidance for antiviral drug design. IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus, invades the central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological dysfunction. Neural cells are its targets for viral progression. However, the detailed mechanism underlying PHEV entry and trafficking remains unknown. PHEV is the etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis, which is an acute and highly contagious disease that causes numerous deaths in suckling piglets and enormous economic losses in China. Understanding the viral entry pathway will not only advance our knowledge of PHEV infection and pathogenesis but also open new approaches to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we employed systematic approaches to dissect the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV in Neuro-2a cells. This is the first report to describe the process of PHEV entry into nerve cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a dynamin-, cholesterol-, and pH-dependent manner that requires Rab5 and Rab7.","output":"Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus Enters Neuro-2a Cells via Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis in a Rab5-, Cholesterol-, and pH-Dependent Manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are on the frontline, struggling with the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To describe recent or past infections, the serological assays enabled the assessment of the immune response developed in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the period when testing was hardly available. In this study, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in HCWs in a Polish teaching hospital and the Regional Occupational Medicine Center after both the first and the second waves. ELISA-based tests for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were used to determine immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in volunteer HCWs who worked in those institutions in May 2020 (208 participants aged 47.1  12.5, 88% women) and in December 2020 (179 participants aged 45.2  12.4, 86% woman). Risk factors for seropositivity were also assessed using a questionnaire filled out by all participants. We reported a significant increase in seroprevalence after the second wave (22.9%) compared with the first outbreak (2.4%) (OR 12.1; 95%CI 4.6C31.3; p < 0.0001). An association between IgG seroprevalence and severity of infections was noted. Furthermore, we demonstrated that amongst medical personnel, nurses exhibited a proportionally higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Moreover, given the high seroprevalence in non-clinical group of HCWs, we suggest that community transmission can play a superior role to workplace exposure.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Healthcare Workers before the Vaccination in Poland: Evolution from the First to the Second Pandemic Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O contexto da atual pandemia tanto nos remete a pestes e pragas do passado quanto nos interroga acerca das possveis transformaes sociais que ser?o - ou n?o - produzidas.

Method: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients admitted from January 31st to February 5th at isolation ward of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were divided into non-survival group and survival group according to the clinical outcomes 5 weeks after admission. Data including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results were obtained. Cardiac injury was defined as serum concentration of high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) above 0.04 g/L. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze the prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to plotted survival curve and analyze the impact of myocardial injury on the survival outcome of COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 202 patients were included, the age was 63 (51, 70) years old, 88 (43.6%) of them were male, 85 (42.1%) of them had comorbidities, 125 (61.9%) of them were severely to critically ill. Till March 11, 33 patients died, all of them were critically ill patients. The age, proportion of males, comorbidities, respire rate, serum levels of hs-cTnI and incidence of heart failure in the non-survival group were significantly higher than those in the survival group (all P<0.05). The hospitalization time of non-survival group was significantly shorter than that of survival group (6(4, 9) vs. 32(23, 36), P<0.001). Myocardial injury was an important prognostic factor of COVID-19 (HR=5.382, 95%CI 2.404-12.05, P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the presence of myocardial injury was significantly associated with the reduced survival rate among COVID-19 patients (P<0.001).

METHODS: A mathematical model with a social network analysis (SNA) approach was used to simulate a COVID-19 outbreak. A discrete-time stochastic simulation model was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 within the Sarang Jeil church. A counterfactual experiment using a calibrated baseline model was conducted to examine the potential benefits of complying with a mask-wearing policy. RESULTS: Simulations estimated a mask-wearing ratio of 67% at the time of the outbreak, which yielded 953.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 937.3 to 970.4) cases and was most consistent with the confirmed data. The counterfactual experiment with 95% mask-wearing estimated an average of 45.6 (95% CI, 43.4 to 47.9) cases with a standard deviation of 20.1. The result indicated that if the church followed government mask-wearing guidelines properly, the outbreak might have been one-twentieth the size. CONCLUSIONS: SNA is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling outbreaks of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Although our results are based on simulations and are thus limited, the precautionary implications of social distancing and mask-wearing are still relevant. Since person-to-person contacts and interactions are unavoidable in social and economic life, it may be beneficial to develop precise measures and guidelines for particular organizations or places that are susceptible to cluster outbreaks.","output":"Reconstructing a COVID-19 outbreak within a religious group using social network analysis simulation in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents a model of pedestrian dynamics based on Cellular Automata, dedicated especially for high density conditions.

AIMS: To examine characteristics of NHs across three Irish Community Health Organisations (CHOs), proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident infection rates symptom-profile, and resident case-fatality. METHODS: Forty-five NHs surveyed requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, outbreak timing, total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases, and outcomes for residents from 29/02/2020-22/05/2020. RESULTS: Surveys were returned from 62.2% (28/45) of NHs (2043 residents, 2,303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1741 residents, 1972 beds). Median time from first COVID-19 case in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident incidence was 43.9% (764/1741): 40.8% (710/1741) laboratory-confirmed, with 27.2% (193/710) asymptomatic, and 3.1% (54/1741) clinically-suspected. Resident case-fatality was 27.6% (211/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed/clinically-suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NHs with \\"early-stage\\" (<28 days) versus \\"later-stage\\" outbreaks developed COVID-19. Lower proportions of residents in \\"early\\" outbreak NHs had recovered compared to those with \\"late\\" outbreaks (37.4% vs 61.7%; &#967;2 = 56.9, P < 0.001). Of 395 NH staff across twelve sites with confirmed COVID-19, 24.7% (99/398) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearman's rho = 0.81, P < 0.001).

Our methodology is based on the classic susceptibleCinfectedCremoved (SIR) model and can track the evolution of infections in communities, i.e., in countries, states or groups of individuals, where we (a) allow for the susceptible and infected populations to be reset at times where surges, outbreaks or secondary waves appear in the recorded data sets, (b) consider the parameters in the SIR model that represent the effective transmission and recovery rates to be functions of time and (c) estimate the number of deaths by combining the model solutions with the recorded data sets to approximate them between consecutive surges, outbreaks or secondary waves, providing a more accurate estimate. We report on the status of the current infections in these countries and states, and the infections and deaths in India and Japan.

Our aim was to identify and collate all the available data and to assess for statistical differences in patient outcomes between the two treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies with a randomised controlled design which utilised stentrievers and intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke. RESULTS Five randomised controlled studies published in 2015 were identified. Second-generation thrombectomy devices constituted at least 80% of thrombectomy devices in the included studies, namely MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, SWIFT PRIME and REVASCAT. No significant heterogeneity was seen in the included studies and the five trials were therefore included in the meta-analysis.A total of 46.10% of patients treated with stentrievers achieved an independent functional outcome (mRS < 2) at 90 days compared with 26.46% of those treated with intravenous thrombolysis with an odds ratio of 2.40 (p < 0.001). The weighted recanalisation mean in the thrombectomy arms was 76.02%.A lower mortality rate was observed with stentrievers compared to intravenous thrombolysis (15.33% vs 18.74%; OR 0.81, p = 0.15).

Literature on the impact on individuals with eating disorders is slowly emerging. While outpatient eating disorder services in Canada have attempted to transition to virtual care, guidelines related to optimal virtual care in this field are lacking. As such, the objective of our Canadian Consensus Panel was to develop clinical practice guidelines related to the provision of virtual care for children, adolescents, and emerging adults living with an eating disorder, as well as their caregivers, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. METHODS: Using scoping review methodology (with literature in databases from 2000 to 2020 and grey literature from 2010 to 2020), the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation tool, and a panel of diverse stakeholders from across Canada, we developed high quality treatment guidelines that are focused on virtual interventions for children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, and their caregivers. RESULTS: Strong recommendations were supported specifically in favour of in-person medical evaluation when necessary for children, adolescents, and emerging adults, and that equity-seeking groups and marginalized youth should be provided equal access to treatment. For children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for telehealth family-based treatment (FBT) and online guided parental self-help FBT. For emerging adults, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help was strongly recommended. Weak recommendations for emerging adults included CBT-based group internet interventions as treatment adjuncts, internet-based relapse prevention Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) guided self-help, telehealth relapse prevention using MANTRA, and guided CBT-based smartphone apps as treatment adjuncts. For caregivers of children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for virtual parent meal support training, and moderated online caregiver forums and support groups. For caregivers of emerging adults, guided parental self-help CBT was strongly recommended, and unguided caregiver psychoeducation self-help was weakly recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Several gaps for future work were identified including the impact of sex, gender, race, and socioeconomic status on virtual care among children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, as well as research on more intensive services, such as virtual day hospitals.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and eating disorders in children, adolescents, and emerging adults: virtual care recommendations from the Canadian consensus panel during COVID-19 and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the risk of infection by blood transfusion is relatively low, breakthrough infections still occur, Transfusion-related fatalities caused by infections continue to be reported, and blood is not tested for many potentially dangerous pathogens. The current paradigm for increasing the safety of the blood supply is the development and implementation of laboratory screening methods and restrictive donor criteria. When considering the large number of known pathogens and the fact that pathogens continue to emerge, it is clear that the utility of new tests and donor restrictions will continue to be a challenge when considering the cost of developing and implementing new screening assays, the loss of potential donors, and the risk of testing errors. Despite improving the safety of blood components, testing remains a reactive approach to blood safety. The contaminating organisms must be identified before sensitive tests can be developed. In contrast, pathogen inactivation is a proactive strategy designed to inactivate a pathogen before it enters the blood supply. Almost all pathogen inactivation technologies target nucleic acids, allowing for the inactivation of a variety of nucleic acidCcontaining pathogens within plasma, platelets, or red blood cells thus providing the potential to reduce transfusion-transmitted diseases.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of total and daily new COVID-19 infections; demographic characteristics and comorbidity burden and severity of infection; factors associated with severe or critical illness. RESULTS: Between 28 February and 18 April 2020, 5685 cases of COVID-19 were identified. Median age was 34 (IQR 28-43) years, 88.9% were male and 8.7% were Qatari nationals. Overall, 83.6% had no concomitant comorbidity, and 3.0% had three or more comorbidities. The overwhelming majority (90.9%) were asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, with 2.0% having severe or critical illness. Seven deaths were observed during the time interval studied. Presence of hypertension or diabetes was associated with a higher risk of severe or critical illness, but age was not. The epidemiological curve indicated two distinct patterns of infection, a larger cluster among expatriate craft and manual workers and a smaller one among Qatari nationals returning from abroad during the epidemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infections in Qatar started in two distinct clusters, but then became more widespread in the population through community transmission.

Predicting student academic performance is crucial to improving the value of education. Some research studies have been conducted which mainly focused on prediction of students performance at higher education. However, research related to performance prediction at the secondary level is scarce, whereas the secondary level tends to be a benchmark to describe students learning progress at further educational levels. Students failure or poor grades at lower secondary negatively impact them at the higher secondary level. Therefore, early prediction of performance is vital to keep students on a progressive track. This research intended to determine the critical factors that affect the performance of students at the secondary level and to build an efficient classification model through the fusion of single and ensemble-based classifiers for the prediction of academic performance. Firstly, three single classifiers including a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), J48, and PART were observed along with three well-established ensemble algorithms encompassing Bagging (BAG), MultiBoost (MB), and Voting (VT) independently. To further enhance the performance of the abovementioned classifiers, nine other models were developed by the fusion of single and ensemble-based classifiers. The evaluation results showed that MultiBoost with MLP outperformed the others by achieving 98.7% accuracy, 98.6% precision, recall, and F-score.

METHODS: We developed a multiplex serological test for measuring antibodies to 5 SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the spike proteins of seasonal coronaviruses. We measured antibody responses in cohorts of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers followed for up to 11 months after symptoms. A mathematical model of antibody kinetics was used to quantify the duration of antibody responses. Antibody response data were used to train algorithms for estimating time since infection. RESULTS: One year after symptoms, we estimate that 36% (95% range, 11%C94%) of anti-Spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) remains, 31% (95% range, 9%C89%) anti-RBD IgG remains, and 7% (1%C31%) of anti-nucleocapsid IgG remains. The multiplex assay classified previous infections into time intervals of 0C3 months, 3C6 months, and 6C12 months. This method was validated using data from a seroprevalence survey in France, demonstrating that historical SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be reconstructed using samples from a single survey.

A brief intervention involving a computer game as an imagery-competing task has shown promising results for reducing the number of intrusive memories of trauma-one of the core clinical symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. To date, the intervention has only been delivered face-to-face. To be tested and implemented on a wider scale, digital adaptation for remote delivery is crucial. An important first step is to develop digitalized intervention materials in a systematic way based on feedback from clinicians, researchers, and students in preparation for pilot testing with target users. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study is to obtain and analyze qualitative feedback on digital intervention materials, namely two animated videos and two quizzes that explain the target clinical symptoms and provide intervention instructions. The second aim is to refine the digitalized materials based on this feedback. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 12 participants who had delivered or had knowledge of the intervention when delivered face-to-face. We obtained in-depth feedback on the perceived feasibility of using the digitalized materials and suggestions for improvements. Interviews were assessed using qualitative content analysis, and suggested improvements were evaluated for implementation using a systematic method of prioritization. RESULTS: A total of three overarching themes were identified from the data. First, participants were highly positive about the potential benefits of using these digital materials for remote delivery, reporting that the videos effectively conveyed key concepts of the symptom and its treatment. Second, some modifications to the materials were suggested for improving clarity. On the basis of this feedback, we made nine specific changes. Finally, participants raised some key challenges for remote delivery, mainly in overcoming the lack of real-time communication during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians, researchers, and clinical psychology students were overall confident in the use of digitalized materials to remotely deliver a brief intervention to reduce intrusive memories of trauma. Guided by participant feedback, we identified and implemented changes to refine the intervention materials. This study lays the groundwork for the next step: pilot testing remote delivery of the full intervention to trauma survivors.","output":"Digitalizing a Brief Intervention to Reduce Intrusive Memories of Psychological Trauma: Qualitative Interview Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic gastrectomy is evolving.

R-VATS was initially developed to overcome the drawbacks of VATS by offering surgeons more flexibility and three-dimensional optics during thoracoscopic surgery. The effectiveness of R-VATS lobectomy regarding oncological outcomes, morbidity, mortality, and postoperative quality of life (QoL) has been shown in an increasing number of studies. More recently, these results have also been corroborated for sublobar resections, more specifically for segmentectomy. However, no well-powered, multicentre randomized trials have been performed to demonstrate the superiority of R-VATS compared with open surgery or conventional types of VATS (total VATS, uniportal VATS, etc.). The majority of the evidence currently available is based on non-randomized studies, and many studies report conflicting results when comparing R-VATS and conventional VATS. Moreover, there is a lack of data regarding the cost and the cost-efficiency of robotic surgery compared with VATS and open surgery. Current evidence suggests that R-VATS costs are higher than VATS and that a deficit can only be prevented when up to 150-300 thoracic surgery procedures are performed annually.

It has not been studied adequately whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LDRT provides additional benefit when used concurrently with steroids amongst other standard pharmacologic therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 51 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients were recruited between November 2020 and July 2021. 34 patients were allotted to receive 0.5Gy single session LDRT along with standard pharmacologic therapy while 17 patients received standard pharmacologic therapy alone. All had SpO2<94% on room air, respiratory frequency > 24/min and SpO2/FiO2 (SF) ratio between >89 but <357. All patients underwent a baseline CT scan. They were followed up for 28 days during when serial SF ratio, blood biomarkers (CRP, Serum ferritin, IL-6), Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), repeat CT scan were performed at pre-defined time points. RESULTS: LDRT showed a statistically significant early improvement in oxygenation, an early time to clinical recovery, early hospital discharge and better radiological resolution compared to control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to ALC or blood biomarkers at any of the measured time points.

METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, we did modelling using longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between March 24, and Sept 29, 2020. Beginning on April 28, in England, the Department of Health and Social Care allocated RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 to app users who logged themselves as healthy at least once in 9 days and then reported any symptom. We calculated incidence of COVID-19 using the invited swab (RT-PCR) tests reported in the app, and we estimated prevalence using a symptom-based method (using logistic regression) and a method based on both symptoms and swab test results. We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo. We used three datasets to validate our models: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey, the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) study, and UK Government testing data. We used geographically granular estimates to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots. FINDINGS: From March 24 to Sept 29, 2020, a total of 2 873 726 users living in England signed up to use the app, of whom 2 842 732 (989%) provided valid age information and daily assessments. These users provided a total of 120 192 306 daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 169 682 invited swab tests. On a national level, our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed a similar sensitivity to changes to those reported in the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On Sept 28, 2020, we estimated an incidence of 15 841 (95% CI 14 023C17 885) daily cases, a prevalence of 053% (045C060), and R(t) of 117 (115C119) in England. On a geographically granular level, on Sept 28, 2020, we detected 15 (75%) of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to government test data. INTERPRETATION: Our method could help to detect rapid case increases in regions where government testing provision is lower. Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policy makers during a quickly moving pandemic, serving as a complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.

The mouse disease is primarily immune-mediated because demyelination is not detected in JHM-infected mice lacking T or B cells but does occur after transfer of JHM-specific T cells. Although less is known about the ability of antibodies to mediate demyelination, the presence of oligoclonally expanded B cells and high concentrations of antibodies (against self or infectious agents) in the central nervous system of many multiple sclerosis patients suggests that antibodies may also contribute to myelin destruction. Here, we show that anti-JHM antibodies, in the absence of T or B cells, caused demyelination in JHM-infected mice. Anti-JHM antibody was detected adjacent to areas of demyelination, consistent with a direct interaction between antibody and infected cells. Demyelination was reduced by 85 to 90% in infected RAG1(-/-) mice lacking normal expression of activating Fc receptors (FcRgamma(-/-)) and by approximately 76% when complement was depleted by treatment with cobra venom factor. These data demonstrate that JHM-specific antibodies are sufficient to cause demyelination and that myelin destruction in the presence of anti-virus antibodies results from a combination of complement- and Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms.","output":"Virus-specific antibody, in the absence of T cells, mediates demyelination in mice infected with a neurotropic coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spillover of novel pathogens from wildlife to people, such as the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is increasing and this trend is most strongly associated with tropical deforestation driven by agricultural expansion.

Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this study, we have used a survey of 17,764 adults in the United States from different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis and Bayesian network inference, we have identified key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches led to effective modeling of the level of mental health prevalence. RESULTS: Overall, females were more stressed than males, and people in the age group 18-29 years were more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian network model, we found that people with a chronic mental illness were more prone to mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new realities of working from home; homeschooling; and lack of communication with family, friends, and neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during the COVID-19-generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised machine learning models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors such as social isolation, digital communication, and working and schooling from home were identified as factors of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular in-person communication with friends and family, a healthy social life, and social security were key factors, and taking care of people with a history of mental disease appears to be even more important during this time.","output":"Learning the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 in the United States With Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Mechanical stimulation can improve the structural properties of the fracture site and induce the differentiation of different cell types for bone regeneration.

We focused on small circulating RNAs from plasma of subjects with prodromal (pre-HD) and overt disease by a two-stage approach: an unbiased investigation by an array method and a validation study to quantify a significant small nucleolar RNA. Methods Through Affymetrix Gene-Chip-miRNA-Array we performed an exploratory study on 9 HD patients, 8 healthy subjects (HS) and 5 psychiatric patients (PP; who share drugs with HD patients, to control for iatrogenic effects). Through real time PCR we validated the results in an independent population of 24 HD patients, 15 pre-HD, 24 PP, 28 Alzheimers disease (AD) patients (added to control the disease-specificity of our finding) and 23 HS. A bioinformatic analysis was also performed to interpret our finding. Results The microarray results showed a significant signal for U13 small nucleolar RNA (SNORD13) that was increased in plasma of HD patients compared to controls (fold change, 1.54, p =0.003 HD vs. HS, and fold change 1.44 p = 0.0026 HD vs. PP). In the validation population the significant increase in HD patients was evident compared to both pre-HD and the three control groups (p<0.00001). The plasma levels of SNORD13 correlated with the status of mutant huntingtin carrier and the disease duration (respectively R=0.69; p<0.000001; R=0.49; p=0.015). Through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we showed high accuracy of plasmatic SNORD13 in discriminating HD patients from pre-HD and control groups (AUC=0.963), outperforming values reported in another study for intrathecal or plasmatic mutant huntingtin and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of overt HD. The bioinformatic analysis on SNORD13 interactome and pathway analysis showed enrichments for factors involved in nuclear functions beyond the ribosome biogenesis. Discussion We report the unprecedented finding of a potential role of small nucleolar RNAs in HD. Circulating SNORD13 seems a good biomarker for clinical purposes.

The sequences from different mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and the sequence from SARS-CoV-2 S protein were obtained from the GenBank. Comparisons of aligned sequences were made by selecting amino acids residues of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S protein; phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the same sequences. The species susceptibility was ranked by substituting the values of amino acid residues for both proteins. Our results ranked primates at the top, but surprisingly, just below are carnivores, cetaceans and wild rodents, showing a relatively high potential risk, as opposed to lab rodents that are typically mammals at lower risk. Most of the sequences from birds, reptiles and amphibians occupied the lowest ranges in the analyses.

RESULTS: The analysis showed that female ( = ?0.271, p < 0.01) healthcare professionals indirectly exposed to patients ( = ?0.336, p < 0.01) and those who reported lower levels of general self-efficacy ( = ?0.295, p < 0.01) have a stronger tendency to experience COVID-19 anxiety [R(2) = 0.301, F(3,89) = 12.34, p < 0.01]. CONCLUSION: The findings show the importance of self-efficacy for dealing with COVID-19 anxiety. The internal coping strategies should be introduced to healthcare workers.","output":"Does Self-Efficacy and Emotional Control Protect Hospital Staff From COVID-19 Anxiety and PTSD Symptoms?

DESIGN: Evidence-based perspective METHODS: Review and synthesis of pertinent literature RESULTS: Retrospective studies highlight that less than 1% of patients display COVID-19 related-conjunctivitis. However, prospective studies suggest the rate is higher, approximately 6%. Viral RNA has been identified in tears and conjunctival secretions in patients with active conjunctivitis as well as asymptomatic cases. Overall, conjunctival swabs are positive in 2.5%. Samples taken earlier in the disease course are more likely to demonstrate positive virus. Viral transmission through ocular tissues has not been substantiated. Ophthalmologists are in the high-risk category for COVID-19 infection for several reasons: high volume clinics, close proximity with patients, equipment intense clinics and direct contact with patients conjunctival mucosal surfaces. COVID-19 is predominantly contracted through direct or airborne transmission by inhalation of respiratory droplets. Evidence that aerosol transmission occurs is increasing in particularly prolonged exposure to high concentrations in a relatively closed environment. Based on the current evidence ophthalmologists should consider measures that include social distancing, wearing masks, sterilisation techniques and managing clinic volumes. CONCLUSIONS: A major challenge to containing COVID-19 is that many infected people are asymptomatic. Droplet spread, contaminated environmental surfaces and shared medical devices are particular areas that require management by ophthalmologists. More studies are required to explore the role of the conjunctiva and ocular tissues in the transmission of disease.","output":"Implications of COVID-19 for Ophthalmologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a major public health threat worldwide.

Caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, its high transmissibility required infected individuals to be placed in negative pressure isolation rooms when admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Studies have shown that limited social support can increase the risk of developing delirium during ICU stays. Minimal research exists on COVID-19-associated ICU delirium as hospitals and government organizations focus on combating equipment shortages and case surges. Here, we present the case of a 64-year-old Filipino male with COVID-19 ICU delirium status post-intubation and ventilation. His hospital course was complicated by the medical staff's assumption that the patient spoke Spanish and improved after being assigned a Tagalog-speaking nurse who facilitated family communication. This case highlights the importance of cultural competency and communication in the management of COVID-19 associated ICU delirium. In particular, Filipino cultural practices and their intersection with healthcare in the larger context of providing culturally competent care are highlighted. The use of culturally competent care serves to assure the use of appropriate services and reduces the occurrence of medical errors due to misunderstandings caused by differences in language or culture. Familial involvement is critical for ICU delirium; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has required healthcare providers to think beyond conventional means. The use of technology to virtually communicate with family also serves as a helpful tool to treat signs of delirium. As seen in this case, a lack of understanding of the Filipino culture resulted in assumptions on the part of the healthcare provider which led to the prolongation of delirium in a COVID-19 ICU patient, but the correct utilization of cultural competence helped the patient recover successfully.","output":"Providing Culturally Competent Care for COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit Delirium: A Case Report and Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Life changed from 1min to the next.

However, when the subject is rare metabolic diseases, there are not enough data in the literature. AIM: To investigate the course of COVID-19 among patients with Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disease. METHODS: Based on the National Health System data, a retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed (polymerase chain reactionpositive) COVID-19 infection (n = 149 618) was investigated. The adverse outcomes between patients with GD (n = 39) and those without GD (n = 149 579) were compared with crude and propensity score-matched (PSM) groups. The outcomes were hospitalisation, the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: The patients with GD were significantly older and had a higher frequency of hypertension (HT), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidaemia, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure and cancer. Although hospitalisation rates in Gaucher patients were found to be higher in crude analyses, the PSM models (model 1, age and gender matched; model 2, matched for age, gender, HT, T2DM and cancer) revealed no difference for the outcomes between patients with GD and the general population. According to multivariate regression analyses, having a diagnosis of GD was not a significant predictor for hospitalisation (P = 0.241), ICU admission/mechanical ventilation (P = 0.403) or mortality (P = 0.231).

Rapid identification of clusters of contemporaneous cases is essential, as these may be indicative of within-facility spread. Nevertheless, in a setting of high community COVID-19 prevalence, a series of ESRD patients may test positive at around the same time without their shared ESRD facility being the nexus for disease spread. Here we describe a series of five cases occurring within an eleven-day period in November 2020 in a hospital-based 32-station ESRD facility in southwest Wisconsin, the subsequent facility-wide testing, and the use of genetic sequence analysis of positive specimens to evaluate whether these cases were linked. Methods: Four patient cases and one staff case were identified in symptomatic individuals by RT-PCR. Facility-wide screening was initiated at the request of local public health and conducted using Abbot BinaxNOW antigen tests. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from residual diagnostic test specimens using an amplicon-based approach on an Ion Torrent S5 sequencer. Results: Residual specimens from 4 of 5 cases were available for sequence analysis. Each sequence was very clearly genetically distinct from the others, indicating that these contemporaneous cases were not linked. Facility-wide screening of 47 staff and 107 patients did not identify any additional cases. Conclusions: These data indicate that despite the outward appearance of a case cluster, the facility did not experience within-facility spread nor serve as the epicenter of a new outbreak, suggesting that the enacted rigorous infection control procedures (screening, masking, distancing) practiced stringently by patients and staff were sufficient to permit dialysis to proceed safely in a very high-risk population under pressure from increasing community spread. These data also demonstrate the utility of rapid turnaround SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in outbreak investigations in settings like ESRD facilities.","output":"Outbreak or pseudo-outbreak?

The present work focuses on the transmission through small droplets released by people from their mouth by breathing, speaking, coughing, sneering, and possibly aspirated by other people around through their respiration. An analysis of droplet evolution in simplified situations shows that the droplets reach very quickly a quasi-equilibrium temperature before encompassing an isothermal evaporation process. The removal of droplets from suspension is thus piloted by balance between evaporation and sedimentation. It is shown that ambient relative humidity is a major factor influencing the lifetime of droplets and the distance they may travel. As a consequence, and independently of any other health consideration linked to ambient humidity, it is seen that a dry air is a favourable factor for limiting risk of contamination from COVID19. Further investigation is made using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in a classroom geometry. Several ventilation strategies are investigated: classical regulatory mechanical ventilation, open window natural ventilation and displacement natural ventilation. Ventilation has several effects which influence contamination risk: by introducing fresh air, it reduces droplet concentration; humidity released by human occupants is also limited. However, these effects are not uniform in space, and depend on ventilation strategy. Application of a doseCeffect model calibrated for COVID19 to CFD results allows to estimate contamination risk. It is shown that contamination risk is higher for regulatory mechanical ventilation, and may be reduced, using natural ventilation in the absence of wind, by a factor 2.3 to nearly 3 when the teacher is sick, and by a factor 6 to 500 when a student is sick. In the presence of wind, the reduction factor is as high as 13 when the teacher is sick and 17 when a student is sick.","output":"Respiratory pandemic and indoor aeraulics of classrooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of literature on the relationship between pre-existing mental health conditions and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes.

METHODS: Electronic medical record data for 30 976 adults tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and 10th July 2020 was analyzed. COVID-19 outcomes included positive screen, hospitalization among screened positive, and mortality among screened positive and hospitalized. Primary independent variable, mental health disorders, was based on ICD-10 codes categorized as bipolar, internalizing, externalizing, and psychoses. Descriptive statistics were calculated, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the relationship between each mental health disorder and COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Adults with externalizing (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95%CI 0.57C0.79) and internalizing disorders (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70C0.88) had lower odds of having a positive COVID-19 test in fully adjusted models.

METHODS: We included consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the 21st COVID-19 Department of the east campus of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 6 to March 7, 2020. Clinical data were collected. Heart rate variability (HRV), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), D-dimer, and lymphocytes and subsets counts were analysed at two time points: nucleic-acid test positive and negative. Psychological symptoms were assessed after discharge. RESULTS: All patients were divided into a mild group (13) and a severe group (21). The latter was further divided into two categories according to the trend of HRV. Severe patients had a significantly lower standard deviation of the RR intervals (SDNN) (P < 0.001), standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals (SDANN) (P < 0.001), and a higher ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF) (P = 0.016). Linear correlations were shown among SDNN, SDANN, LF/HF, and laboratory indices (P < 0.05). Immune function, D-dimer, and NT-proBNP showed a consistent trend with HRV in severe patients (P < 0.05), and severe patients without improved HRV parameters needed a longer time to clear the virus and recover (P < 0.05).

Data from 2019 suggested there could be more than 210,000 homeless children in temporary accommodation (TA) or sofa surfing, and ~585,000 who are either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless in England.ObjectivesTo explore the housing environmental barriers to optimal health for children under the age of five (U5s) experiencing homelessness and living in TA.MethodsThe study employed a mixed-methods, participatory design integrating citizen science to identify housing-level barriers to achieving optimal health. Participants were mothers of U5s living in TA, and conveniently sampled at a local charity providing support to U5s experiencing homelessness in Newham, London. Newham has the highest number of children in TA in England (1 in 12 children are homeless) and 1 in 2 children live in poverty. The study had two parts(i) Housing Survey and (ii) House Visits.A housing survey utilised citizen science methodology to collect data including mobile phone images and free text captions to describe the TA housing conditions including those which participants considered as barriers to their childs health. The survey was first piloted over two weeks on five participants, following refinement based on collaborative feedback and dialogue between the doctoral researcher and study participants. To compliment the housing survey, the doctoral researcher visited the participants TA and took observational notes with an audio-recorder and digital photos.A thematic analysis was conducted to triangulate themes across the data. Kingfishers Unfit Housing UK Research Report guided the categories for the results. Specific factors explored within these data included ease of access to the property, safety risks, disrepairs, visible structural problems, poor ventilation, temperature control, space (e.g., for a baby to crawl).ResultsIn the Housing Survey, fifteen participants collected data over a period of one month at the end of 2019. In 2019C2020, four House Visits were completed (Pre-COVID), but further visits were cancelled due to the pandemic.Several themes were prominent and overlapped across the Housing Surveys and House Visits, which were noted as risks to child health and development. Thematic categories included (i) overcrowding, (ii) dampness/mould growth, (iii) poor/inadequate kitchen/toilet facilities, (iv) infestations/vermin, (v) structural problems/disrepair, (vi) unsafe electrics, (vii) excessively cold/warm due to inadequate temperature regulation and (viii) unsafe surfaces that risk causing trips or falls.ConclusionsThe Early Years is a short, yet vital period to ensure to the next generation have the best start in life, however U5s in TA face numerous barriers in the housing environment which have significant short- and long-term health impacts. Despite a small sample size, findings are consistent with the Childrens Commissioner Bleak houses report and likely to be generalisable across other similar families experiencing homelessness in England.Policy should be enacted to regulate the conditions of TA across England with greater monitoring of and accountability for the safety and regulations to ensure that these environments promote optimal growth and development for U5s.","output":"Identifying housing-level barriers to optimal health for Under5s experiencing homelessness: a citizen science approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Current data on the risk of transmission of 2009 H1N1 Influenza in public transportation systems (e.g., public trains, busses, airplanes) are conflicting. The main transmission route of this virus is thought to be via droplets, but airborne transmission has not been completely ruled out. METHODS: This is a contact tracing investigation of a young woman subsequently diagnosed with the 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus who was symptomatic during a long-distance bus trip from Spain to Switzerland. Fever and cough had begun 24 h earlier, 2 h before she stepped onto a bus for a long-distance trip. After the 2009 H1N1 virus had been confirmed in the patient, the other bus travellers were contacted by telephone on day 7 and 10 after the bus trip. RESULTS: Of the 72 individuals travelling on the bus with the H1N1-infected young woman, 52 (72%) could be contacted. Only one of these 52 developed fever, with onset of symptoms 3 days after the bus trip, and rRT-PCR analysis of the nasopharyngeal swab showed the infection to be caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus. One other person complained of coughing 1 day after the bus trip, but without fever, and no further investigation was carried out. All other passengers remained without fever, coughing, or arthralgia. The risk of transmission was calculated as 1.96% (95% confidence interval 0C5.76%). CONCLUSION: The transmission rate of 2009 H1N1 Influenza was low on a long-distance bus trip.

Recently, vitamin D deficiency was identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in healthy people, as it predisposes to different vascular dysfunctions that can result in plaque development and fragility. In this scenario, the fundamental aim of the study was to reproduce a disease model inducing vitamin D deficiency and atheromatosis in ApoE-/- mice and then to evaluate the impact of this vitamin D status on the onset/progression of atheromatosis, focusing on plaque formation and instability. METHODS AND RESULTS: In our murine disease model, vitamin D deficiency was achieved by 3 weeks of vitamin D deficient diet along with intraperitoneal paricalcitol injections, while atheromatosis by western-type diet administration. Under these experimental conditions, vitamin D deficient mice developed more unstable atheromatous plaques with reduced or absent fibrotic cap. Since calcium and phosphorus metabolism and also cholesterol and triglycerides systemic concentration were not affected by vitamin D level, our results highlighted the role of vitamin D deficiency in the formation/instability of atheromatous plaque and, although further studies are needed, suggested a possible intervention with vitamin D to prevent or delay the atheromatous disease.

(2) How does this differ in the hospital versus private practice setting? (3) If called on to operate on a patient with COVID-19, how do plastic surgeons protect themselves and still provide excellent medical care? METHODS: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic review of the literature on plastic surgery in the setting of a pandemic was performed on March 19, 2020. An ethical analysis was conducted using the four principles of medical ethics. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 118 articles. Eighteen articles were relevant and included for analysis. Only one editorial article was published in a plastic surgery journal. Accordingly, no peer-reviewed published COVID-19 guidelines exist for plastic surgery. Given that this pandemic may place health care systems under undue stress with an unpredictable trajectory, it is the responsibility of the plastic surgeon to assess and postpone cases whenever possible to properly contribute to adequate resource allocation and patient safety measures.

To assist in tracing infection pathways and design preventive strategies, a deep understanding of the viral genetic diversity landscape is needed. We present here a set of genomic surveillance tools from population genetics which can be used to better understand the evolution of this virus in humans. To illustrate the utility of this toolbox, we detail an in depth analysis of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed 329,854 high-quality consensus sequences published in the GISAID database during the pre-vaccination phase. We demonstrate that, compared to standard phylogenetic approaches, haplotype networks can be computed efficiently on much larger datasets. This approach enables real-time lineage identification, a clear description of the relationship between variants of concern, and efficient detection of recurrent mutations. Furthermore, time series change of Tajima's D by haplotype provides a powerful metric of lineage expansion. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) highlights key steps in variant emergence and facilitates the visualization of genomic variation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 diversity.

The resulting situation posed great challenges to teachers, guardians and students (Huber and Helm 2020). Research has shown that perceived competence (Deci and Ryan 2000) affects selfregulated learning (SRL), intrinsic motivation and procrastination, however few studies have considered these variables in context of distance learning among adolescents. This study investigated differences in students who perceived themselves as high vs. low in competence with respect to these constructs. In an online questionnaire, 2652 Austrian secondary school students answered closed questions regarding SRL, intrinsic motivation and procrastination as well as open-ended questions about challenges, successes and need for support in distance. Structural equation modeling was applied for the quantitative analysis which was complemented by thematic analysis for the qualitative questions (Braun and Clarke 2006). Results showed that students who experienced themselves as highly competent use SRL strategies (goal setting and planning, time management, metacognitive strategies) more often and are more intrinsically motivated than students with lower perceived competence. They also procrastinate less. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed that although all students face similar challenges (e.g., independent learning, time and task management, learning on the computer, lack of contact with teachers and peers), students who perceived themselves as highly competent seemed to cope better, and have less need for support.

However, poor hepatitis C knowledge among patients could impede the effectiveness of screening and treatment programs. OBJECTIVE: We assessed knowledge on hepatitis C among rural Rwandans initiating DAA treatment for hepatitis C in a prospective cohort. METHODS: We administered 15 true-false statements before treatment initiation and during one follow-up visit occurring either 1 or 2 months after treatment initiation. We assessed the average number of correct responses per patient, the proportion of correct responses to individual statements, pre-treatment predictors of knowledge, and whether post-initiation knowledge was associated with time since treatment initiation, quality of care, or adherence. RESULTS: Among 333 patients who answered knowledge questions before treatment initiation, 325 (97.6%) were re-assessed at a post-initiation visit. Pre-initiation, 72.1% knew hepatitis C was curable, 61.9% knew that hepatitis C could cause liver damage or cancer, and 42.3% knew that people with hepatitis C could look and feel fine. The average number of correct responses was 8.1 out of 15 (95% CI: 7.8C8.5), but was significantly lower among those with low educational attainment or with low literacy. Post-initiation, correct responses increased by an average of 2.0 statements (95% CI: 1.6, 2.4, p-value <0.001). Many patients still mistakenly believed that hepatitis C could be transmitted through kissing (66.5%), eating utensils (44.1%), handshakes (34.8%), and hugs (34.8%). Post-initiation knowledge is inversely associated with self-reported quality of care and unassociated with self-reported adherence. CONCLUSION: Although knowledge improved over time, key gaps persisted among patients. Accessible public education campaigns targeted to low-literacy populations emphasizing that hepatitis C can be asymptomatic, has severe consequences, and is curable could promote participation in mass screening campaigns and linkage to care. Visual tools could facilitate clinician-provided patient education.","output":"Knowledge among patients with Hepatitis C initiating on direct-acting antiviral treatment in rural Rwanda: A prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While programs and interventions intended to increase positive affect among people living with HIV (PLWH) and other chronic diseases have been associated with improved health outcomes, including decreased depression, programs have not been tailored specifically for Black women.

At present however, there are only three major classes of drugs for treating human nematode infections. Additionally the scientific knowledge on the mechanism of action and the reason for the resistance to these drugs is poorly understood. Commercial incentives to design drugs that are endemic to developing countries are limited therefore, virtual screening in academic settings can play a vital role is discovering novel drugs useful against neglected diseases. In this study we propose to build robust machine learning model to classify and screen compounds active against parasitic nematodes. RESULTS: A set of compounds active against parasitic nematodes were collated from various literature sources including PubChem while the inactive set was derived from DrugBank database. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used for model development, and stratified ten-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of each classifier. The best results were obtained using the radial basis function kernel. The SVM method achieved an accuracy of 81.79% on an independent test set. Using the model developed above, we were able to indentify novel compounds with potential anthelmintic activity. CONCLUSION: In this study, we successfully present the SVM approach for predicting compounds active against parasitic nematodes which suggests the effectiveness of computational approaches for antiparasitic drug discovery. Although, the accuracy obtained is lower than the previously reported in a similar study but we believe that our model is more robust because we intentionally employed stringent criteria to select inactive dataset thus making it difficult for the model to classify compounds.

The association of comorbidities and other variables with the risks were studied by fitting a spatial panel data linear model (splm). As results, we observed that on average the greatest risks were reached by July, and that highest risks were observed in some states, Baja California Norte, Chiapas, and Sonora; interestingly, some densely populated states, as Mexico City, had lower values.

SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS There has been a growing concern in the last few years with the exposure of children to environmental chemicals. Around 85,000 synthetic chemicals are produced today, and 2,800 of them are mass-produced. There is little knowledge regarding their effects on developing organisms. Children have a greater exposure to environmental pollutants than adults, because their metabolic needs and behaviors (e.g.: crawling, bringing objects to the mouth, playing closer to the ground) put them at special risk of contact with chemicals when they breathe, eat, drink or play. Heavy metals, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants and, at home, environmental tobacco smoke have been associated with the increasing number of diseases such as asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders and childhood cancer.

In the present study, we investigate the determinants of perceived threat and engagement in self-protective measures in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Austria during the first wave of the pandemic. The type of disease (coronavirus vs. seasonal flu) and the type of numerical information regarding the disease (number of recovered vs. number of dead) were manipulated. Participants cognitive and emotional risk assessment as well as self-reported engagement in protective behaviors were measured. Results show that worry was the best predictor of perceived threat in all countries. Moreover, a path analysis revealed that worry and perceived threat serially mediated the effect of type of disease on engagement in self-protective behaviors. The numerical framing manipulation did not significantly impact behavior but had a direct effect on worry and an indirect effect on perceived threat. These results are in line with theoretical accounts that identify emotions as a central determinant for risk perception. Moreover, our findings also suggest that effective risk communication during the COVID-19 pandemic should not stress comparisons to other, well-known viral diseases, as this can ultimately reduce self-protective behaviors.","output":"Worry, Perceived Threat and Media Communication as Predictors of Self-Protective Behaviors During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) confers elevated risk for automobile crashes, both as a clinical syndrome and continuously when examining risk as a function of symptom severity. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms and processes underlying this risk remain poorly understood. The current longitudinal study examined whether attention network components reflect neurocognitive pathways linking ADHD symptoms with adverse driving outcomes. Method: Drivers from six U.S. sites participating in the Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study (N=3,226) were prospectively monitored for objectively identified crashes, near-crashes, and crash/near-crash fault. At study entry, drivers were assessed for ADHD symptoms; completed the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, Second Edition; and were then followed continuously for 1-2 years of routine, on-road driving using technology-enhanced in-car monitoring. Bias-corrected, bootstrapped mediation models examined the extent to which attention network components mediated the association between ADHD symptoms and future driving risk, controlling for known risk factors. Results: As expected, self-reported ADHD symptoms predicted all markers of future driving risk. Higher ADHD symptoms were associated with reduced inhibitory control, lower levels of top-down attentional control (endogenous orienting), and greater arousal decrements (phasic alertness). Controlling for ADHD symptoms, top-down attentional control uniquely predicted future crashes, near-crashes, and culpability for future crashes/near-crashes; only arousal decrements portended future near-crashes. Only top-down attentional control significantly mediated the association between baseline ADHD symptoms and future driving risk. Conclusions: The driving risks associated with ADHD appear to be conveyed in part by impairments in the top-down, voluntary control of attention, rather than by difficulties sustaining attention over time or inhibiting impulses, as is often assumed.

Tremendous effort has been spent to investigate the effective way to prevent this \\"complication\\" including the modification of surgical technique, use of per-peritoneal drainage, etc. There were debates about the use of monopolar diathermy versus blunt dissection in laparoscopic TEP in the prevention of seroma formation. This randomized study aims to compare the effects of using 2 techniques in laparoscopic TEP on pre-peritoneal drain output and seroma formation. METHOD From 1.9.2018 to 30.9.2019, all male and female patients presented with the first occurrence, unilateral inguinal hernia anticipated for laparoscopic TEP were enrolled into the study after informed consent. Patients were randomized into \\"monopolar dissection preferred\\" (MDP) group and \\"blunt dissection-preferred\\" (BDP) group just before commencing of operation after general anesthesia. Surgeons were instructed to use monopolar energy as main dissection method for the whole operation if possible (MDP), whereas blunt dissection is the preferred choice in BDP group, but the use of monopolar energy was allowed if needed. Total energy time was measured by a specially designed homemade device attaching to the monopolar pedals as accurate as to millisecond (ms). Pre-peritoneal drains were inserted for drainage and removed 23 h after operation. Drainage output, total operating time, energy time, clinical and ultrasonic seroma sizes at day 1, day 6, 1-month post operations, recurrence are compared between 2 groups. RESULTS A total of 103 patients where included. There was no significant difference in age, gender, co-morbidities, side of hernia, mean defect size, operating time, fixation adjuncts, or postoperative stay. The drain volume in BDP group is 71.13  31.42 mL while it in MDP group is 56.36  21.46 mL. The MDP group had significantly fewer drain output at 23 h post operation (p = 0.007) and lower seroma incidence on days 6 (p = 0.036). Overall incidence of seroma formation was 12% on postoperative day 1, 11% on postoperative day 7. No statistically differences in postoperative pain score or complications were observed at the first week, 1- and 3-months' post operation. There was no correlation with energy time to the drain output. No recurrence was found in subsequent follow-up. CONCLUSION Pre-peritoneal drainage is clinically safe in laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal hernioplasty and can effectively reduce the size and incidence of seroma. The seroma formation can be further reduced by appropriate use of monopolar energy as preferred dissection approach in lap TEP. Due to limitation in measuring the actual energy time, the result should be further validated by randomized multi-centers trial on its potential benefit in hernia repair by a more accurate measuring device on energy used.","output":"Does the use of monopolar energy as the preferred mode of dissection effectively reduce seroma formation in laparoscopic total extra peritoneal hernioplasty?

We aim to identify the risk factors for the transmission of COVID-19 using data on mainland China. We estimated attack rate (AR) at county level. Logistic regression was used to explore the role of transportation in the nationwide spread. Generalized additive model and stratified linear mixed-effects model were developed to identify the effects of multiple meteorological factors on local transmission. The ARs in affected counties ranged from 0.6 to 9750.4 per million persons, with a median of 8.8. The counties being intersected by railways, freeways, national highways or having airports had significantly higher risk for COVID-19 with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.40 (p = 0.001), 2.07 (p < 0.001), 1.31 (p = 0.04), and 1.70 (p < 0.001), respectively. The higher AR of COVID-19 was significantly associated with lower average temperature, moderate cumulative precipitation and higher wind speed. Significant pairwise interactions were found among above three meteorological factors with higher risk of COVID-19 under low temperature and moderate precipitation. Warm areas can also be in higher risk of the disease with the increasing wind speed.

Participants performed 50 maximal effort concentric knee flexions on a dynamometer. Results Twenty-four hours after exercise, levels of serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and myoglobin increased in controls. In contrast, only myoglobin level increased in patients. All elevated serum markers declined by 48 hours after exercise in both groups. Mild soreness developed at 24 hours, which disappeared at 48 hours in both groups. In controls, MRI R2* relaxation rate reduced immediately and 24 hours after exercise, indicating increased water content and muscle perfusion. In patients, exercise had no effect on R2* values. The resistance exercise did not induce acute strength deficit in patients, rather, patients increased their strength by 24 hours.

Consequently, there are limited data in the literature on the delivery of inhaled medications administered with different aerosol devices in mechanically ventilated patients with a tracheostomy tube (TT). The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare the efficiency of aerosol devices in a lung model of an intubated and mechanically ventilated adult with a TT. METHODS An in vitro lung model was constructed to simulate a ventilator-dependent adult with a Portex TT and a Mallinckrodt ETT (8-mm inner diameter). Aerosol was collected distal to the bronchi of an adult mannikin on a filter attached to a passive test lung. A ventilator delivered adult breathing parameters (tidal volume 450 mL, breathing frequency 20 breaths/min, peak expiratory flow 40 L/min, and inspiratory-expiratory ratio 1:3) to the airway. A jet nebulizer and pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) were placed in the inspiratory limb of the circuit 15 cm from the Y-adapter. The jet nebulizer was operated at 8 L/min to deliver albuterol sulfate (2.5 mg/3 mL), whereas an albuterol pMDI was actuated 4 times with a spacer. Drug was eluted from the filter and analyzed by spectrophotometry. RESULTS Drug delivered via a TT was marginally greater compared with an ETT using the jet nebulizer and pMDI (P = .10 and .046, respectively). Although delivery efficiency with the pMDI was 3-fold greater than with the jet nebulizer with both a TT and an ETT (P = .001 and .002, respectively), the jet nebulizer delivered greater drug mass compared with the pMDI with either a TT (P = .01) or an ETT (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS Aerosol drug delivery via a TT was greater than with an ETT, whereas the delivery efficiency of a pMDI via either airway was greater than that of a jet nebulizer.","output":"Pressurized Metered-Dose Inhalers Versus Nebulizers in the Treatment of Mechanically Ventilated Subjects With Artificial Airways: An In Vitro Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implicit and explicit attitudes influence our behavior.

METHODS The paper analyzes a retrospective series of cytological specimens from cavities effusions (N = 605). Five HHV8-related lymphoproliferative processes were recruited. A combination of morphological criteria (enhanced with MGG staining), cell block-based immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry is required for the final characterization. RESULTS The identification of malignant cells may be insidious. Some specimens are particularly rich, easily leading to suspect a lymphoproliferative process, whereas in the other cases the presence of abundant reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, neutrophils, small reactive T and B lymphocytes may obscure the neoplastic process. The biological behaviour may be very heterogeneous and a standardized therapy for these cases is still lacking, although some patients may benefit from the antiretroviral therapy in HIV-setting.

Their offspring were meat and egg hybrids via Artificial insemination. We measured expression of MUSTN1, IGF-1, and PDK4 using qRT-PCR. We examined muscle fiber diameter using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that muscle development was two days slower in chicken, egg hybrid, and meat hybrid than in quail. Muscle fiber spacing was the largest in chicken, followed by meat hybrid, egg hybrid, and quail. A similar trend was obtained for muscle fiber diameter. Additionally, muscle fiber diameter increased with embryogenesis. The sarcomere was present on day 17 of incubation in quail, but not in the other species. MUSTN1 could up-regulated IGF-1 by activating PI3K/Akt. IGF-1 expression was consistent with myoblast proliferation and myotube fusion. PDK4 was expressed from E7 to E17.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a serious complication during antimicrobial treatment of CWD. The pathomechanisms of IRIS have not been identified and mucosal barrier integrity has not been studied in patients with IRIS CWD. METHODS: In 96 CWD patients (n = 23 IRIS, n = 73 non\\\\IRIS) and 30 control subjects, we analysed duodenal morphology by histology, measured serum markers of MT, and proinflammatory cytokines in biopsy supernatants, and correlated microbial translocation with T cell reconstitution and activation. RESULTS: Before treatment, duodenal specimens from patients who later developed IRIS exhibited a more pronounced morphological transformation that suggested a disturbed barrier integrity when compared with the non\\\\IRIS group. Villous atrophy was mediated by increased apoptosis of epithelial cells, which was insufficiently counterbalanced by regenerative proliferation of crypt cells. Pretreatment deficiencies in the mucosal secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL\\\\6, CCL2) in these patients markedly resolved after therapy induction. High serum levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), soluble CD14 (sCD14), and LPS\\\\binding protein (LBP) combined with low endotoxin core antibody (EndoCAb) titres suggested systemic MT in CWD patients developing IRIS. CD4(+) T cell count and activation in IRIS CWD patients correlated positively with sCD14 levels and negatively with EndoCAb titres. Furthermore, the degree of intestinal barrier dysfunction and MT was predictive for the onset of IRIS. CONCLUSION: Prolonged MT across a dysfunctional intestinal mucosal barrier due to severe tissue damage favors dysbalanced immune reconstitution and systemic immune activation in IRIS CWD. Therefore, the monitoring of inflammatory and MT markers in CWD patients might be helpful in identifying patients who are at risk of developing IRIS. Therapeutic strategies to reconstitute the mucosal barrier and control inflammation could assist in the prevention of IRIS.","output":"Intestinal barrier dysfunction mediates Whipple's disease immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study aimed to evaluate the current surgical techniques for anterior and posterior vaginal wall prolapse repair in South Korea.

Eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older; severe pneumonia with pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, a clinical history of severe shortness of breath within the past 14 days, or a need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation; severe disease defined as a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO2/FiO2) between 100 mm Hg and 250 mm Hg in the supine position; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IFX-1 (up to seven doses of 800 mg intravenously) plus best supportive care (IFX-1 group) or best supportive care only (control group). The primary outcome was the percentage change in PaO2/FiO2 in the supine position between baseline and day 5. Mortality at 28 days and treatment-emergent and serious adverse events were key secondary outcomes. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in all patients according to treatment received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04333420). Findings: Between March 31 and April 24, 2020, 30 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the IFX-1 group (n=15) or the control group (n=15). During the study it became clear that several patients could not be assessed regularly in the supine position because of severe hypoxaemia. It was therefore decided to focus on all PaO2/FiO2 assessments (irrespective of position). At day 5 after randomisation, the mean PaO2/FiO2 (irrespective of position) was 158 mm Hg (SD 63; range 84-265) in the IFX-1 group and 189 mm Hg (89; 71-329) in the control group. Analyses of the least squares mean relative change in PaO2/FiO2 at day 5 showed no differences between treatment groups (17% change in the IFX-1 group vs 41% in the control group; difference -24% [95% CI -58 to 9], p=015. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 28 days were 13% (95% CI 0-31) for the IFX-1 group and 27% (4-49) for the control group (adjusted hazard ratio for death 065 [95% CI 010-414]). The frequency of serious adverse events were similar between groups (nine [60%] in the IFX-1 group vs seven [47%] in the control group) and no deaths were considered related to treatment assignment. However, a smaller proportion of patients had pulmonary embolisms classed as serious in the IFX-1 group (two [13%]) than in the control group (six [40%]). Infections classed as serious were reported in three (20%) patients in the IFX-1 group versus five (33%) patients in the control group. Interpretation: In this small exploratory phase 2 part of the PANAMO trial, C5a inhibition with IFX-1 appears to be safe in patients with severe COVID-19. The secondary outcome results in favour of IFX-1 are preliminary because the study was not powered on these endpoints, but they support the investigation of C5a inhibition with IFX-1 in a phase 3 trial using 28-day mortality as the primary endpoint.

The study objective was to describe differences in time from injury to arrival for patients with traumatic hip fractures admitted during the pandemic to pre-pandemic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study at six level I trauma centers included patients with traumatic hip fractures. Patients with a non-fall mechanism and those who were transferred in were excluded. Patients admitted 16 March 2019-30 June 2019 were in the \\"pre-pandemic\\" group, patients were admitted 16 March 2020-30 June 2020 were in the \\"pandemic\\" group. The primary outcome was time from injury to arrival. Secondary outcomes were time from arrival to surgical intervention, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and mortality. RESULTS: There were 703 patients, 352 (50.1%) pre-pandemic and 351 (49.9%) during the pandemic. Overall, 66.5% were female and the median age was 82 years old. Patients were similar in age, race, gender, and injury severity score. The median time from injury to hospital arrival was statistically shorter for pre-pandemic patients when compared to pandemic patients, 79.5 (56, 194.5) min vs. 91 (59, 420), p = 0.04. The time from arrival to surgical intervention (p = 0.64) was statistically similar between groups. For both groups, the median HLOS was 5 days, p = 0.45. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher during the pandemic, 1.1% vs 3.4%, p = 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: While time from injury to hospital arrival was statistically longer during the pandemic, the difference may not be clinically important. Time from arrival to surgical intervention remained similar, despite changes made to prevent COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Delayed hospital admission for traumatic hip fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Reliable evidence suggests that anticipating humoral response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines is essential for predicting their clinical effectiveness. In this work, we sought to establish if and to what extent the response of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies BNT162b2 booster measured with four different commercial immunoassays could be predicted after initial homologous vaccination. METHODS: This observational study enrolled 181 SARS-CoV-2 baseline seronegative healthcare workers (mean age 4213 years; 59.7% females), who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. Antibodies levels were assessed with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S, ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG II, Snibe S-RBD IgG and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG. The correlation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies 21 days after the first vaccine dose and 30 days after the second was assessed with Pearson's test. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies levels after the first (T1) and second (T2) BNT162b2 vaccine doses with all immunoassays, though the strength of such association depended on the immunoassay. Briefly, the highest correlation was found for LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (r=0.71), followed by ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG II (r=0.65), Snibe S-RBD IgG (r=0.52), and then Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (r=0.40).

A total of 716 young adults participated in the study by completing the ad hoc online questionnaire (#YesWeHand), which analyzed, among other aspects, the age range, gender and field of study that they belonged to. From the total participants, 81.3% indicated knowing how to perform HH correctly, while 49.4% affirmed having received training.

Since ACE2 is a favorable enzyme, we were interested in finding a molecule capable of binding spike S1, but not ACE2, and inhibiting the interaction between spike S1 and ACE2. Holy basil (Tulsi) has a long history as a medicine for different human disorders. Therefore, we screened different components of Tulsi leaf and found that eugenol, but not other major components (e.g. ursolic acid, oleanolic acid and -caryophylline), inhibited the interaction between spike S1 and ACE2 in an AlphaScreen-based assay. By in silico analysis and thermal shift assay, we also observed that eugenol associated with spike S1, but not ACE2. Accordingly, eugenol strongly suppressed the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, but not vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), into human ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells. Eugenol also reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced activation of NF-B and the expression of IL-6, IL-1 and TNF in human A549 lung cells. Moreover, oral treatment with eugenol reduced lung inflammation, decreased fever, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice.

They rely on bidirectional neural interfaces, which represent the communication bridge between nervous system and neuroprosthetic device by controlling its movements and evoking sensory feedback. Compared to extraneural electrodes (i.e., epineural and perineural implants), intraneural electrodes, implanted within peripheral nerves, have higher selectivity and specificity of neural signal recording and nerve stimulation. However, being implanted in the nerve, their main limitation is represented by the significant inflammatory response that the body mounts around the probe, known as Foreign Body Reaction (FBR), which may hinder their rapid clinical translation. Furthermore, the mechanical mismatch between the consistency of the device and the surrounding neural tissue may contribute to exacerbate the inflammatory state. The FBR is a non-specific reaction of the host immune system to a foreign material. It is characterized by an early inflammatory phase eventually leading to the formation of a fibrotic capsule around intraneural interfaces, which increases the electrical impedance over time and reduces the chronic interface biocompatibility and functionality. Thus, the future in the reduction and control of the FBR relies on innovative biomedical strategies for the fabrication of next-generation neural interfaces, such as the development of more suitable designs of the device with smaller size, appropriate stiffness and novel conductive and biomimetic coatings for improving their long-term stability and performance.

OBJECTIVES To investigate how attitudes towards euthanasia differ among countries, how they change, and how economic, religious, and health-related factors affect these attitudes. METHODS We analyzed attitudes towards euthanasia and economic, religious, and health-related indicators using longitudinal (1981-2018) World Values Survey (WVS) data. They included 62 countries with at least a 15-year, three-wave, time series (total n=389,243 participants). Each national survey interviewed representative samples of adults (mean=1,405). RESULTS In the latest wave, The Netherlands had the most favorable views of euthanasia (10-point scale with 1=least justifiable: Mean=7.47) and Jordan the least (Mean=1.50). Residents of 23 of 24 high-income countries came to view euthanasia as more justifiable, while residents of 12 of 38 middle- and low-income countries came to view it as less justifiable over time. The higher GDP per-capita at the time of survey, the more euthanasia was accepted (r=0.703; p<0.0001); the more important respondents viewed religion as being, the less euthanasia was accepted (r= -0.834; p<0.0001); the higher life expectancy and the lower infant mortality were, the more euthanasia was accepted (r=0.669; p<0.0001/r=-0.716; p<0.0001). CONCLUSION Euthanasia-related attitudes differ widely depending on the cultural context; changes over time varied in both directions; euthanasia-related attitudes were associated with economic, religious and health-related factors.

With the outbreak of COVID-19, the education learners, practitioners, and other stakeholders were at the sake of a loss, as it causes the suspension of physical classes and physical interaction of the learners. In these circumstances, Electronic learning (E-learning), Online learning, and the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools came in handy. It helped the learners in the dissemination of ideas, conducting online classes, making online discussion forums, and taking online examinations. Like the government of each country, the Indian government was also caught off-guard but the existing E-learning infrastructure was able to leverage on while devising plans to tailor them to new situations and launching new ones. The initiatives at the forefront of this noble battle launched by the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD) includes Diksha, Swayam Prabha Channel, Shiksha Van, E-Pathshala, and National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER). It worth noting that apart from the Indian central government efforts, each state has various online education initiatives that are tailored to their needs. This research evaluated each of these initiatives commenced by central and state governments and present a detailed analysis of most of the relevant initiatives. Additionally, a survey is conducted to get insights of learners in concern to online learning.

The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. METHODS: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 g/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month.

This is a highly challenging task, since harsh measures may result in economic collapse while a relaxed strategy might lead to a high death toll. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of forming intervention strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that optimize the trade-off between the number of deceases and the socio-economic costs. We demonstrate that the healthcare capacity and the testing rate highly affect the optimal intervention strategies. Moreover, we propose an approach that enables practical strategies, with a small number of policies and policy changes, that are close to optimal. In particular, we provide tools to decide which policies should be implemented and when should a government change to a different policy. Finally, we consider how the presented results are affected by uncertainty in the initial reproduction number and infection fatality rate and demonstrate that parametric uncertainty has a more substantial effect when stricter strategies are adopted.","output":"Optimal intervention strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recent viral outbreak that has rapidly spread to multiple countries worldwide.

Therefore, we aimed to study if the aerosol properties related to the different sources and meteorological conditions we can observe in continental and coastal urbanized areas can have an influence on the atmospheric transport of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This paper focuses on the lockdown period to reduce the differences in the social behavior. As an example, we investigated the contamination cases during March 2020 in two specific French areas located in both continental and coastal areas with regard to the meteorological conditions and the corresponding aerosol properties. To this end, we used both the optical depth (AOD) and the Angstrom exponent provided by the AERONET network. The results show that the analysis of aerosol ground-based data can be of interest to assess a virus survey. In particular, our data show that moderate to strong onshore winds occurring in coastal regions, which allow large sea-spray production episodes, deal with smaller COVID-19 contamination rates. This suggests that the coagulation of SARS-Cov-2 viral particles with hygroscopic salty sea-spray aerosols would tend to inhibit its viral infectivity via possible reaction with NaCl, especially in high relative humidity environments.

This study measured antibodies against different antigen targets in healthcare workers (HCW) who have been fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccines, recovered from natural infection, or patients during active infection. All vaccinated individuals were positive for anti-RBD, anti-S1, and anti-S2 antibodies. The median index and interquartile range (IQR) by the Atellica IgG assay were 179 and 140-291 respectively. Among the different antigen targets within the Bioplex assay, the levels of anti-RBD were highest (median >3200 U/mL; IQR >3200 to >3200 U/mL), followed by anti-S1 (median 2132 U/mL; IQR 1649->3200 U/mL) and anti-S2 (median=42 U/mL; IQR=24-76 U/mL).

At the peak of the pandemic, trauma and orthopaedic services at our institutions undertook internal restructuring, diverting resources to frontline medical care. Consequently, we sought to assess the impact on the elderly and comorbid patients presenting with femoral neck fractures, with a particular focus on 30-day mortality, length of stay, multidisciplinary team involvement and departmental structuring. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of patients presenting with femoral neck fractures at three separate West London NHS Trusts was undertaken between March 11, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Length of stay, 30-day mortality and adherence to parameters constituting the best care evidence-based practice tariffs were compared between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and negative patients. A similar comparison was also conducted between our cohort and the equivalent period in 2018 using data from the National Hip Fracture Database. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients presenting with femoral neck fractures were identified, mean age 81 (range 38C98), 73% female. There were 10 confirmed/suspected cases of COVID-19 on admission and a further seven confirmed as inpatients. The 30-day mortality within our cohort was 11.76% compared to 6% nationally in 2018 (p = 0.045). Orthogeriatric reviews occurred within 72 h in 71% of cases compared to 88% in the equivalent 2018 period. Within the cohort, mean length of stay was 17.13 days (SD 5.6, range 8-27 days) for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients compared to 10 days (SD 8.7, range 1C53 days) for negative patients (p < 0.05). Thirty-two patients (47%) required increased packages of care on discharge or rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in 30-day mortality for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients presenting with femoral neck fractures is multifactorial, resulting from a combination of the direct effects of COVID-19 pneumonia as well as changes to the delivery of orthopaedic services. The provision of multidisciplinary care was directly affected by staff redeployment, particularly reorganisation of orthogeriatric services and lack of continuity of ward based clinical care. Our experiences have re-directed efforts towards the management of theatre teams, patient services and staffing, should we be faced with either a resurgence of COVID-19 or a future pandemic.","output":"Increased perioperative mortality for femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): experience from the United Kingdom during the first wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A field experiment, using a paired audit testing design with testers of different racial and language profiles, was conducted to document and evaluate individual encounters in inquiring about COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. states. Testers communicated with state health department and major vaccination site staff about obtaining the COVID-19 vaccine and assessed the extent to which evidence-informed communication tactics for encouraging take-up were employed. The audit testers included individuals representing Latinx identities, given research showing they face greater hardships in navigating vaccine infrastructure and place less trust in public immunization efforts. Data were collected in phone and electronic communications between mid-June and mid-August of 2021. Empirical analyses confirmed that states vary considerably in how clearly officials communicate vaccination requirements and procedures, and in what they ask of individuals before providing the opportunity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The Spanish-speaking tester was more likely to encounter negative or racialized languageprimarily implicit in naturesuch as calls abruptly ended (vs. attempting to secure language support) and requests for additional identification or personal information before continuing with vaccination registration. Examples of overtly negative or racist encounters included condescending comments about Latinx testers' identification (or perceived undocumented status) and the Spanish-speaking tester's communication in Spanish. Analysis of an index of good practices constructed from the audit data revealed that very few strategies for promoting vaccinations were regularly implemented. In regression analyses, an additional point on the good practices index predicted a 0.133 percentage point increase in the percent of the population receiving the first vaccine dose, suggesting the lack of implementation of these good practices may represent a missed opportunity to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates.

METHODS: Serial thin-section CT scans of 17 discharged patients with COVID-19 were obtained during recovery. Longitudinal changes of clinical parameters and a CT pattern were documented in all patients during the 4 weeks after admission. A CT score was used to evaluate the extent of the disease. RESULTS: There were marked improvements of fever, lymphocyte counts, C-reactive proteins, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates within the first 2 weeks after admission. However, the mean CT score rapidly increased from the first to the third week, with a top score of 8.2 obtained in the second week. During the first week, the main CT pattern was ground-glass opacities (GGO; 76.5%). The frequency of GGO (52.9%) decreased in the second week. Consolidation and mixed patterns (47.0%) were noted in the second week. Thereafter, consolidations generally dissipated into GGO, and the frequency of GGO increased in the third week (76.5%) and fourth week (71.4%). Opacities were mainly located in the peripheral (76.5%) and subpleural (47.1%) zones of the lungs; they presented as focal (35.3%) or multifocal (29.4%) in the first week and became more diffuse in the second (47.1%) and third weeks (58.8%), then showed a reduced extent in fourth week (50%).

We identified the following 4 themes: negative postpartum experience in hospital owing to the absence of a support person(s); poor postpartum mental health, especially in women with preexisting mental health conditions and those who had had medically complicated deliveries; asking for help despite public health regulations that prohibited doing so; and problems with breastfeeding owing to limited in-person follow-up care and lack of in-person breastfeeding support. INTERPRETATION: Policies that restrict the presence of support persons in hospital and at home during the postpartum period appear to be causing harm. Measures to mitigate the consequences of these policies could include encouraging pregnant people to plan for additional postpartum support, allowing a support person to remain for the entire hospital stay and offering additional breastfeeding support.","output":"Women's postpartum experiences in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring location updates from mobile users has important applications in many areas, ranging from public health (e.g., COVID-19 contact tracing) and national security to social networks and advertising. However, sensitive information can be derived from movement patterns, thus protecting the privacy of mobile users is a major concern. Users may only be willing to disclose their locations when some condition is met, for instance in proximity of a disaster area or an event of interest. Currently, such functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such cryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow decryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they rely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application to the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose secure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that complement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by reducing the amount of required pairing operations. We implement two optimizations that further improve performance: materialization of results to expensive mathematical operations, and parallelization. We also propose an heuristic that brings down the computational overhead through enlarging an alert zone by a small factor (given as system parameter), therefore trading off a small and controlled amount of privacy for significant performance gains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly improve performance compared to the baseline, and reduce the searchable encryption overhead to a level that is practical in a computing environment with reasonable resources, such as the cloud.","output":"A secure location-based alert system with tunable privacy-performance trade-off"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High frequency oscillations (HFO) are receiving increased attention for their role in health and disease. Ketamine-dependent HFO have been identified in cortical and subcortical regions in rodents, however, the mechanisms underlying their generation and whether they occur in higher mammals is unclear. Here, we show under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, classical gamma oscillations diminish and a prominent > 80 Hz oscillation emerges in the olfactory bulb of rats and cats. In cats negligible HFO was observed in the thamalus and visual cortex indicating the OB was a suitable site for further investigation. Simultaneous local field potential and thermocouple recordings demonstrated HFO was dependent on nasal airflow. Silicon probe mapping studies spanning almost the entire dorsal ventral aspect of the OB revealed this rhythm was strongest in ventral areas of the bulb and associated with microcurrent sources about the mitral layer. Pharmacological microinfusion studies revealed HFO was dependent on excitatory-inhibitory synaptic activity, but not gap junctions. Finally, we showed HFO was preserved despite surgical removal of the piriform cortex. We conclude that ketamine-dependent HFO in the OB are driven by nasal airflow and local dendrodendritic interactions.

BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China in December of 2019, several studies attempted to identify the epidemiological, viral and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. Given the rapid widespread transmission of the COVID-19 disease worldwide, a more comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of its features is needed to better inform nurses, clinicians and public health policy makers. METHODS: A rapid review and meta-analysis were carried out to identify the main diagnostic features of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients at the time of hospitalisation. All case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies published from 01/01/2020 till 30/06/2020 in English and Chinese that stated all or at least two of the outcomes of interest (clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings) were included. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals. Conduction of the review adheres to the PRISMA checklist. RESULTS: 21 studies involving 8837 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. Fever, cough and fatigue were the most common clinical features, while the most relevant laboratory abnormalities at the time of hospitalisation were lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase. CT images showed a bilateral lung involvement, with ground glass infiltrates and patchy shadows on most patients. CONCLUSION: This review provides an up-to-date synthesis of main diagnostic features of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients at the time of hospitalisation.

Students' ability to stay on track is measured by three data indicators: percentage of modules submitted before the due date, percentage of modules submitted early for extra credit, and percentage of modules properly engaged with. The student population is divided into two demographic groups according to each of the four demographic variables: Gender, Ethnicity, Transfer Status and First generation status. All three data indicators from both semesters are first compared between each pair of demographic groups within the same semester, and then compared within the same group between the two semesters. Exam and course scores are also compared between demographics groups in Fall 2020 and against scores from the Fall 2019 semester. The analysis revealed that remote learning significantly reduced on-time and early submission for first-generation students, but increased the frequency of early submission for transfer students. Under-represented minority students had higher percentage of engaged modules during the pandemic, while non-URM students had the same level of module engagement before and after the pandemic.

Individuals having sequential positive tests at least 90 days apart were considered to have suspected reinfections. Main outcome measuresIncidence of suspected reinfections through time; comparison of reinfection rates to the expectation under a null model (approach 1); empirical estimates of the time-varying hazards of infection and reinfection throughout the epidemic (approach 2) Results35,670 suspected reinfections were identified among 2,796,982 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a positive test result at least 90 days prior to 27 November 2021. The number of reinfections observed through the end of the third wave was consistent with the null model of no change in reinfection risk (approach 1). Although increases in the hazard of primary infection were observed following the introduction of both the Beta and Delta variants, no corresponding increase was observed in the reinfection hazard (approach 2). Contrary to expectation, the estimated hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection was lower during waves driven by the Beta and Delta variants than for the first wave (relative hazard ratio for wave 2 versus wave 1: 0.75 (CI95: 0.59-0.97); for wave 3 versus wave 1: 0.71 (CI95: 0.56-0.92)). In contrast, the recent spread of the Omicron variant has been associated with a decrease in the hazard coefficient for primary infection and an increase in reinfection hazard coefficient. The estimated hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection for the period from 1 November 2021 to 27 November 2021 versus wave 1 was 2.39 (CI95: 1.88-3.11). ConclusionPopulation-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta variants. This finding has important implications for public health planning, particularly in countries like South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection.

Although vaccines have been approved by the FDA for emergency use in the U.S., patients will continue to require pharmacologic intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality as vaccine availability remains limited. The rise of new variants makes the development of therapeutic strategies even more crucial to combat the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Evidence from several studies suggests the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Consequently, host immune factors are becoming more recognized as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. To develop therapeutic strategies to combat current and future coronavirus outbreaks, understanding how the coronavirus hijacks the host immune system during and after the infection is crucial. In this study, we investigated immunological patterns or characteristics of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed large bulk RNASeq and single cell RNAseq data from COVID-19 patient samples to immunoprofile differentially expressed gene sets and analyzed pathways to identify human host protein targets. We observed an immunological profile of severe COVID-19 patients characterized by upregulated cytokines, interferon-induced proteins, and pronounced T cell lymphopenia, supporting findings by previous studies. We identified a number of host immune targets including PERK, PKR, TNF, NF-kB, and other key genes that modulate the significant pathways and genes identified in COVID-19 patients.

Samples were collected from 77 individuals of which 75 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and classified as symptomatic (n = 29), asymptomatic (n = 31), or postsymptomatic (n = 15). Specimens were collected at one time point from each individual, between day 1 and 23 after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis, and included self-collected saliva (S), or sublingual (SL) swab, and bilateral anterior nares (AN) swab, followed by health care provider collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Sixty-three specimen sets were tested using five assay/platforms. The diagnostic sensitivity of each assay/platform and specimen type was determined. Of the 63 specimen sets, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 62 NP specimens, 52 AN specimens, 59 saliva specimens, and 31 SL specimens by at least one platform. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from 21 NP, 13 AN, 12 saliva, and one SL specimen out of 50 specimen sets. SARS-CoV-2 isolation was most successful up to 5 days after initial COVID-19 diagnosis using NP specimens from symptomatic patients (16 of 24 positives, 66.67%), followed by specimens from asymptomatic patients (5 of 17 positives, 29.41%), while it was not very successful with specimens from postsymptomatic patients.

OBJECTIVES To synthesize findings from clinical psychology and affective neuroscience related to the construct of emotional temperament; to examine the effects of antidepressants on the temperament dimensions of positive (PA) and negative affectivity (NA); and to propose a biobehavioral research paradigm for the treatment of MDD. METHODS We begin with an introduction to PA and NA, which emphasizes their construct development, historical context, and relevance to psychopathology. We then review studies of antidepressant effects on PA and NA, and explore two related hypotheses: (1) Cause-correction: The antidepressant response may fundamentally occur through changes in emotional temperament, with subsequent spread to syndrome or symptom changes; (2) preferential effects: Antidepressants with different mechanisms of action may have preferential effects on PA or NA. RESULTS Preliminary findings appear to support the cause-correction hypothesis; there is insufficient clinical evidence to support the preferential effects hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS PA and NA are biologically based temperament dimensions, which modulate emotional, motivational, and behavioral responses to positive and negative incentives. They can be altered by antidepressants, and may independently contribute to depression improvement. In addition, the distinct biobehavioral features of PA and NA suggest that combined pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments targeting these dimensions may have specific, and perhaps, synergistic antidepressant effects.","output":"Antidepressant effects on emotional temperament: toward a biobehavioral research paradigm for major depressive disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2021, the UK and devolved governments tried to avoid the school exams fiasco of 2020.

This reluctance is mainly due to anatomic factors, technical factors, and a long learning curve (relative to transfemoral access). We present here our experience of TRA transition for cerebral aneurysm embolization. Our aim was to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of radial access for consecutive embolizations of ruptured and unruptured cerebral aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of a prospective data base on cerebral aneurysm embolizations. Between April and December 2018, radial access was considered for all consecutive patients referred to our institution for cerebral aneurysm embolization. Technical success was defined as radial access with insertion of the sheath and completion of the intervention without a crossover to conventional femoral access. The primary safety end point was the in-hospital plus 30-day incidence of radial artery occlusion. Secondary end points included intraoperative complications and neurologic complications at discharge and in the following 30 days. RESULTS Seventy-one patients with a cerebral aneurysm underwent 73 embolization procedures at our institution. The first-choice access route was the radial artery in 62 patients (87.3%) and the femoral artery in 9 (12.6%). Thirty-four embolizations were performed using coils, 22 used a balloon-assisted coil technique, 6 used a stent-assisted coil technique, and 2 used a flow diverter. Crossover to femoral access was observed in 2 patients (3.1%). Four patients developed coil-induced thrombi requiring intra-arterial tirofiban injections. In 1 case, an aneurysm ruptured during the operation but did not have a clinical impact. No cases of radial artery occlusion or hand ischemia were observed.

We have demonstrated that COLC might exert protective cardiovascular effects by interfering with cytoskeleton rearrangement, a phenomenon involved in platelet aggregation. Here, we investigate in vitro the effects of colchicine on platelet aggregation of patients on DAPT with clopidogrel. Platelets obtained from 35 CCS patients on therapy with clopidogrel were pre-incubated with COLC 10 M before being stimulated with ADP (20 M), or TRAP (25 M) at 0, 30, 60 and 90 min to measure max aggregation by LTA. Platelets not COLC-preincubated served as controls. Seven patients were pre-selected as clopidogrel non-responders. COLC significantly reduced TRAP-induced platelet aggregation in clopidogrel responders and non-responders. Interestingly, COLC inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in clopidogrel non-responders in which ADP still caused activation despite DAPT. We demonstrate that COLC inhibits platelet aggregation in clopidogrel non-responders with HPR despite DAPT with this ADP receptor-inhibitor. Further in vivo studies should be designed to evaluate the opportunity to prescribe colchicine after ACS/CCS to overcome the clopidogrel limitations in the DAPT therapy.","output":"Effects of colchicine on platelet aggregation in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We performed a prospective survey on the adverse reactions following the first dose of two types of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare workers (HCWs) in South Korea. METHODS: HCWs at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea, received a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) or an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) between March 5 and March 26, 2021. The HCWs were asked to report adverse reactions through a mobile self-report questionnaire for three days after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 7,625 HCWs received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine during the study period. Of them, 5,866 (76.9%) HCWs (ChAdOx1, n = 5,589 [95.3%]; BNT162b2, n = 277 [4.7%]) participated at least once in the survey, of whom 77% were female and 86% were younger than 50 years. The overall adverse reaction rate was 93% in the ChAdOx1 group and 80% in the BNT162b2 group (P < 0.001). Both local and systemic reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group, and the difference was larger in systemic reactions such as fever and fatigue. In the ChAdOx1 group, the incidence of adverse reactions was significantly higher in females and those in the younger age groups, while the BNT162b2 group showed such difference according to age. CONCLUSION: In our prospective survey, vaccine-associated adverse reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group than in the BNT162b2 group. Females and younger age groups experienced vaccine-associated adverse reactions more frequently.","output":"Adverse Reactions Following the First Dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine and BNT162b2 Vaccine for Healthcare Workers in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is a clinical condition characterized by acute behavioral and mood changes, abnormal movements, autonomic instability, seizures, and encephalopathy.

However, efficacy of training hinges on questions such as accessibility and how intuitively the training can be translated into reality. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in particular relies on adequate training modalities in order to compensate for its additional psychomotor and visuospatial challenges. The increasing demand for MIS procedures longs for further enhancement of training and steep learning curves. We are investigating a nouveau training concept that continuously utilizes the first person view as addendum to laparoscopic view. We hypothesize this approach to be more intuitive thus faster and more naturally to apprehend than a laparoscopic view only and aim to establish a new standard to implement into training curricula. Methods and analysis The present study is conducted as a monocentric, two-arm randomized trial. Participants undergo a training curriculum in laparoscopic suturing and knot tying, using e-learning video material with either the first-person perspective of the surgeon or the laparoscopic view only. Primary endpoint is the total training time needed to reach a predefined proficiency level. Participants are evaluated by blinded raters using validated checklists. Number of attempts, procedure and knot quality subscore difference as well as metric parameter analysis from the first and last knots analyzed as secondary endpoints. Furthermore, trainees are assessed with regard to surgical background, basic skills level and spatial awareness. A total sample size of 80 participants for the analysis of the primary endpoint was determined, which will be performed as a two-sided t-test. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty at Heidelberg University (Code S-334/2011). This trial was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) in Freiburg, Germany, on May 6th (DRKS00009997).

In some instances, the subsets defined by phenotypic FACS separation are relatively homogeneous and so establishing the functions associated with them is straightforward. Other subsets, such as the Double negative (DN, CD19+CD27-IgD-) population, are more complex with reports of differing functionality which could indicate a heterogeneous population. Recent advances in single-cell techniques enable an alternative route to characterize cells based on their transcriptome. To maximize immunological insight, we need to match prior data from phenotype-based studies with the finer granularity of the single-cell transcriptomic signatures. We also need to be able to define meaningful B cell subsets from single cell analyses performed on PBMCs, where the relative paucity of a B cell signature means that defining B cell subsets within the whole is challenging. Here we provide a reference single-cell dataset based on phenotypically sorted B cells and an unbiased procedure to better classify functional B cell subsets in the peripheral blood, particularly useful in establishing a baseline cellular landscape and in extracting significant changes with respect to this baseline from single-cell datasets. We find 10 different clusters of B cells and applied a novel, geometry-inspired, method to RNA velocity estimates in order to evaluate the dynamic transitions between B cell clusters. This indicated the presence of two main developmental branches of memory B cells. A T-independent branch that involves IgM memory cells and two DN subpopulations, culminating in a population thought to be associated with Age related B cells and the extrafollicular response. The other, T-dependent, branch involves a third DN cluster which appears to be a precursor of classical memory cells. In addition, we identify a novel DN4 population, which is IgE rich and closely linked to the classical/precursor memory branch suggesting an IgE specific T-dependent cell population.","output":"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analyses Define Distinct Peripheral B Cell Subsets and Discrete Development Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the initial pandemic wave of COVID-19, apart from common presenting symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue), many countries have reported a sudden increase in the number of smell and taste dysfunction patients.

The pathophysiology of post-infectious olfactory loss was hypothesized that viruses may produce an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa or damage the olfactory neuroepithelium directly. However, loss of smell could be presented in COVID-19 patients without other rhinologic symptoms or significant nasal inflammation. This review aims to provide a brief overview of recent evidence for epidemiology, pathological mechanisms for the smell, and taste dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Between 2007 and 2009, 52 children hospitalised with a well-documented diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with or without parapneumonic empyema (PPE), were enrolled in the study. The patients were classified into 2 groups: CAP + PPE (n = 28) and CAP (n = 24). The identification of respiratory viruses and bacteria in nasopharyngeal aspirates and pleural effusion samples were performed using conventional bacterial techniques and molecular assays. Using real-time multiplex PCR and antigen detection, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the main agent identified in 76% of the cases by molecular tests and BinaxNOW? in pleural fluid. A total of 8% of pleural fluid samples remained undiagnosed. In nasopharyngeal aspirates, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were detected in both CAP and CAP + PPE populations; however, the percentage of viral co-detection was significantly higher in nasopharyngeal aspirates from CAP + PPE patients (35%) compared with CAP patients (5%). In conclusion, viral co-detection was observed mainly in patients with more severe pneumonia. Molecular biology assays improved the pathogens detection in pneumonia and confirmed the S. pneumoniae detection by BinaxNOW? in pleural effusion samples.

Methylene blue, instilled through a bronchoscope on top of the proximal cuff, was used as leakage tracer. Fiberoptic visualisation of the trachea was performed 1 h and 24 h thereafter. Leakage was confirmed if blue dye was detected on the tracheal mucosa beyond the tip of the ETT. In no patient, dye passed by the cuffs during the study period. Presence of the ETT did not interfere with ventilator settings, patient mobilization, physiotherapy, and technical acts. Overall, pressures in the intercuff space remained between 10 and 15 cmH(2)O.

We examine the contribution of drug resistance mutations for low viral suppression in HIV-positive participants in a population-based sero-prevalence survey in rural South Africa. METHODS: We conducted HIV drug resistance genotyping and ART analyte testing on dried blood spots (DBS) from HIV-positive adults participating in a 2014 survey in North West Province. Among those with virologic failure (> 5000 copies/mL), we describe frequency of DRM to protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), report association of resistance with antiretroviral therapy (ART) status, and assess resistance to first and second line therapy. Analyses are weighted to account for sampling design. RESULTS: Overall 170 DBS samples were assayed for viral load and ART analytes; 78.4% of men and 50.0% of women had evidence of virologic failure and were assessed for drug resistance, with successful sequencing of 76/107 samples. We found 1 DRM in 22% of participants; 47% were from samples with detectable analyte (efavirenz, nevirapine or lopinavir). Of those with DRM and detectable analyte, 60% showed highClevel resistance and reduced predicted virologic response to 1 NRTI/NNRTI typically used in first and second-line regimens. CONCLUSIONS: DRM and predicted reduced susceptibility to first and second-line regimens were common among adults with ART exposure in a rural South African population-based sample.

Studies to date are largely surveys and lack meaningful involvement from service users in their design, planning, and delivery. The study aimed to examine the mental health status and coping strategies of young people during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown using coproduction methodology. METHODS: The mental health status of young people (aged 16-24) in April 2020 was established utilizing a sequential explanatory coproduced mixed methods design. Factors associated with poor mental health status, including coping strategies, were also examined using an online survey and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Since the lockdown, 30.3% had poor mental health, and 10.8% had self-harmed. Young people identifying as Black/Black-British ethnicity had the highest increased odds of experiencing poor mental health (odds ratio [OR] 3.688, 95% CI .54-25.40). Behavioral disengagement (OR 1.462, 95% CI 1.22-1.76), self-blame (OR 1.307 95% CI 1.10-1.55), and substance use (OR 1.211 95% CI 1.02-1.44) coping strategies, negative affect (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.07-1.15), sleep problems (OR .915 95% CI .88-.95) and conscientiousness personality trait (OR .819 95% CI .69-.98) were significantly associated with poor mental health. Three qualitative themes were identified: (1) pre-existing/developed helpful coping strategies employed, (2) mental health difficulties worsened, and (3) mental health and nonmental health support needed during and after lockdown. CONCLUSION: Poor mental health is associated with dysfunctional coping strategies.

Conversely, silencing NRAV suppressed IAV replication and virus production, suggesting that reduction of NRAV is part of the host antiviral innate immune response to virus infection. NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3 and MxA, by affecting histone modification of these genes.

In the 1960s-1970s it became more usual to wear green and blue \`scrubs in order to look for a greater contrast in clothing with the all-white hospital environment. In contemporary times, some specialties even stopped using specific uniforms, while others still use them. At the same time, PPE became more and more important, up to nowadays \\"plague costume\\" in the combat of the COVID-19 epidemics.","output":"A brief history of medical uniforms: from ancient history to the COVID-19 time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Convalescent plasma from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and monoclonal antibodies were shown to potently neutralize viral and pseudoviral particles carrying the S glycoprotein. However, a non-negligent proportion of plasma samples from infected individuals, as well as S-specific monoclonal antibodies, were reported to be non-neutralizing despite efficient interaction with the S glycoprotein in different biochemical assays using soluble recombinant forms of S or when expressed at the cell surface. How neutralization relates to the binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here, we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA, ELISA, and neutralization assays, we observed a strong correlation between these parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of pseudoviral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Antibody Binding to SARS-CoV-2 S Glycoprotein Correlates with but Does Not Predict Neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of the research is to identify specific of AI in healthcare, its nature, and specifics and to establish complexities of AI implementation in healthcare and to propose ways to eliminate them. PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: This study was conducted during June-October of 2020. Through a broad literature review, analysis of EU, USA regulation acts, scientific researches and opinions of progressive-minded people in this sphere this paper provide a guide to understanding the essence of AI in healthcare and specifics of its regulation. It is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive methods. RESULTS Results: One of the first broad definitions of AI sounded like \\"Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things that make people seem intelligent ... The central goals of Artificial Intelligence are to make computers more useful and to understand the principles which make intelligence possible.\\" There are two approaches to name this technology - \\"Artificial intelligence\\" and \\"Augmented Intelligence.\\" We prefer to use a more common category of \\"Artificial intelligence\\" rather than \\"Augmented Intelligence\\" because the last one, from our point of view, leaves much space for \\"human supervision\\" meaning, and that will limit the sense of AI while it will undoubtedly develop in future. AI in current practice is interpreted in three forms, they are: AI as a simple electronic tool without any level of autonomy (like electronic assistant, \\"calculator\\"), AI as an entity with some level of autonomy, but under human control, and AI as an entity with broad autonomy, substituting human's activity wholly or partly, and we have to admit that the first one cannot be considered as AI at all in current conditions of science development. Description of AI often tends to operate with big technological products like DeepMind (by Google), Watson Health (by IBM), Healthcare's Edison (by General Electric), but in fact, a lot of smaller technologies also use AI in the healthcare field - smartphone applications, wearable health devices and other examples of the Internet of Things. At the current stage of development AI in medical practice is existing in three technical forms: software, hardware, and mixed forms using three main scientific-statistical approaches - flowchart method, database method, and decision-making method. All of them are useable, but they are differently suiting for AI implementation. The main issues of AI implementation in healthcare are connected with the nature of technology in itself, complexities of legal support in terms of safety and efficiency, privacy, ethical and liability concerns. CONCLUSION Conclusion: The conducted analysis makes it possible to admit a number of pros and cons in the field of AI using in healthcare. Undoubtedly this is a promising area with a lot of gaps and grey zones to fill in. Furthermore, the main challenge is not on technology itself, which is rapidly growing, evolving, and uncovering new areas of its use, but rather on the legal framework that is clearly lacking appropriate regulations and some political, ethical, and financial transformations. Thus, the core questions regarding is this technology by its nature is suitable for healthcare at all? Is the current legislative framework looking appropriate to regulate AI in terms of safety, efficiency, premarket, and postmarked monitoring? How the model of liability with connection to AI technology using in healthcare should be constructed? How to ensure privacy without the restriction of AI technology use? Should intellectual privacy rights prevail over public health concerns? Many questions to address in order to move in line with technology development and to get the benefits of its practical implementation.","output":"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICAL PRACTICE: REGULATIVE ISSUES AND PERSPECTIVES."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research indicates that Canadian healthcare workers, particularly long-term care (LTC) workers, are frequently composed of immigrant and racialized/visible minorities (VM) who are often precariously employed, underpaid, and face significant work-related stress, violence, injuries, illness, and health inequities. Few studies, however, have analyzed the contributions and impact of their labor in international contexts and on global communities. For instance, it is estimated that over CAD 5 billion-worth of remittances originate from Canada, yet no studies to date have examined the contributions of these remittances from Canadian workers, especially from urbanized regions consisting of VM and immigrants who live and/or work in diverse and multicultural places like Toronto. The present study is the first to investigate health and LTC workers roles and behaviors as related to remittances. The rationale for this study is to fill important knowledge gaps. Accordingly, this study asked: Do health/LTC workers in the site of study send remittances? If so, which workers send remittances, and who are the recipients of these remittances? What is the range of monetary value of annual remittances that each worker is able to send? What is the purpose of these remittances? What motivates the decision to send remittances? This mixed-methods study used a single-case design and relied on interviews and a survey. The results indicate that many LTC workers provided significant financial support to transnational families, up to CAD 15,000 annually, for a variety of reasons, including support for education and healthcare costs, or as gifts during cultural festivals. However, the inability to send remittances was also a source of distress for those who wanted to assist their families but were unable to do so. These findings raise important questions that could be directed for future research. For example, are there circumstances under which financial remittances are funded through loans or debt? What are the implications for the sustainability and impact of remittances, given the current COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effect of dampening incomes and wages, worsening migrants health, wellbeing, and quality of life, as well as adversely affecting recipient economies and the quality of life of global communities?. ? 2021 by the author.

This cohort study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in asymptomatic cancer patients. METHODS: Patients in all age groups and with any type of cancer who have been in remission or have stable disease and received their latest anticancer therapy over 2 months ago included in the study. All patients were evaluated for COVID-19 symptoms and only asymptomatic patients were enrolled for serologic screening for SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples evaluated serologically for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 168 asymptomatic cancer patients were included in the study. Of the 168 cases with a history of cancer who were asymptomatic for Covid-19, 29 cases (17.26%) had a positive serological test. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in the present study asymptomatic cancer patients revealed 17% seropositivity, approximately equal to the general population of the same age, sex, geographic region, and epidemic status.

Viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are typically spared in this process, but the mechanisms of target selectivity during host shutoff remain poorly understood. Using transcriptome-wide and targeted reporter experiments, we demonstrate that the influenza A virus endoribonuclease PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. Proximity-labeling proteomics reveals that PA-X interacts with cellular RNA processing proteins, some of which are partially required for host shutoff. Thus, PA-X taps into host nuclear pre-mRNA processing mechanisms to destroy nascent mRNAs shortly after their synthesis. This mechanism sets PA-X apart from other viral host shutoff proteins that target actively translating mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Our study reveals a unique mechanism of host shutoff that helps us understand how influenza viruses suppress host gene expression.","output":"The Influenza A Virus Endoribonuclease PA-X Usurps Host mRNA Processing Machinery to Limit Host Gene Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented growth in the availability of data of all types and qualities and the emergence of the field of data science has provided an impetus to finally realizing the implementation of the full breadth of the Nolan and Temple Lang proposed integration of computing concepts into statistics curricula at all levels in statistics and new data science programs and courses.

The rising trends of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with multidrug-resistant pathogens from the environmental water have similarly gained much attention in recent years. Wastewater-based epidemiology from water samples has shown that a wide range of AMR-related genes is frequently detected. Albeit sewage is treated before release and thus, the abundance of pathogens should be significantly reduced or even pathogen-free, several studies indicated the contrary. Pathogens are still measurable in the released water, ultimately entering freshwaters, such as rivers and lakes. Furthermore, socio-economic and environmental factors, such as chemical industries and animal farming nearby, impact the presence of AMR. Many bacterial species from the environment are intrinsically resistant and also contribute to the resistome of freshwater lakes. This study collected the most extensive standardized freshwater data set from hundreds of European lakes and conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis on antimicrobial resistance from these freshwater lakes. Our research shows that genes encoding for AMR against tetracyclines, cephalosporins, and quinolones were commonly identified, while for some, such as sulfonamides, resistance was less frequently present.

However, molecular networks dont exist independently of each other. In a network of networks approach (called multiplex), we uncover the design principles for the joint organization of transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results We find that TRN and PPI networks are non-randomly coupled in the TRN-PPI multiplex across five different eukaryotic species. Gene degrees in TRN (number of downstream genes) are positively correlated with protein degrees in PPI (number of interacting protein partners). Gene-gene interactions in TRN and protein-protein interactions in PPI also non-randomly overlap in the multiplex. These design principles are conserved across the five eukaryotic species. We show that the robustness of the TRN-PPI multiplex is dependent on these design principles. Further, functionally important genes and proteins, such as essential, disease-related and those involved in host-pathogen PPI networks, are preferentially situated in essential parts of the human multiplex with highly overlapping interactions.

In this paper, we refer to the West as represented by United States plus the five most populous countries of Western Europe, and the East as the 15 countries of East Asia and Oceania that are members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This paper argues that the currently available information points to the factors most responsible for this divide. Warnings by early January 2020 about an atypical viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, prompted rapid responses in many jurisdictions in East Asia. Publication of the virus's genome on 10 January 2020 provided essential information for making diagnostic tests and launching vaccine development. China's lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January 2020 provided a final, decisive signal of the danger of the new disease. By late March 2020, China had fully controlled its epidemic, and many other RCEP countries had taken early and decisive measures that aborted serious outcomes. Delayed and halting responses in the United States and most other Western countries allowed the disease to take hold and spread. In both the East and the West, stringent population-wide non-pharmaceutical interventions were widely implemented at great cost to societies, economies, and school systems. Without these measures, the outcomes could have been even worse. Most countries in the East also implemented tightly focused policies to isolate infectious individuals. Even today, most countries in the West allow infectious individuals to mingle with their families, coworkers, and communities. Much of the East-West divide plausibly results from failure in the West to implement the basic public health policies of early action and the isolation of infectious individuals. Widespread immunization in high-income countries will soon attenuate their outbreaks, while the slow rollout of vaccines in lower income countries is replacing the East-West divide in outcomes with a North-South one. The South will then replace the West as the breeding ground for more contagious or pathogenic variants of the virus.","output":"The East-West Divide in Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen,Nun sind wir seit mehr als einem Monat mit einer Pandemie konfrontiert und wahrscheinlich hat niemand von uns so etwas schon einmal in seinem Leben erlebt.

The causes are multifactorial, of which changes in circadian rhythmicity may play a role. Melatonin plays a crucial role as part of the circadian and sleep/wake cycle. Whether sedation effects circadian regulation is unknown. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the melatonin concentration in critically ill patients randomized to sedation or non-sedation and to investigate the correlation with delirium. METHODS: All patients were included and randomized at the intensive care unit at the hospital of southwest Jutland, Denmark. Seventy-nine patients completed the study (41 sedated and 38 non-sedated). S-melatonin was measured 3 times per day, (03.00, 14.00, and 22.00), for 4 consecutive days in total, starting on the second day upon randomization/intubation. The study was conducted as a sub-study to the NON-SEDA study in which one hundred consecutive patients were randomized to sedation or non-sedation with a daily wake-up call (50 in each arm). Primary outcome: melatonin concentration in sedated vs. non-sedated patients (analyzed using linear regression). Secondary outcome: risk of developing delirium or non-medically induced (NMI) coma in sedated vs. non-sedated patients, assessed by CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit) analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Melatonin concentration was suppressed in sedated patients compared to the non-sedated. All patients experienced an elevated peak melatonin level early on in the course of their critical illness (p = 0.01). The risk of delirium or coma (NMI) was significantly lower in the non-sedated group (OR 0.42 CI 0.27; 0.66 p < 0.0001).

The antibodies were obtained from a phage display library built with the VH repertoire of a convalescent COVID-19 patient who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta). The patient received a single dose of Ad5-nCoV vaccine (Convidecia?, CanSino Biologics Inc.) one month before developing COVID-19 symptoms. Four synthetic VL libraries were used as counterparts of the immune VH repertoire. After three rounds of panning with SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain wildtype (RBD-WT) 34 unique scFvs, were identified, with 27 cross-reactive for the RBD-WT and RBD Delta (RBD-DT), and seven specifics for the RBD-WT. The cross-reactive scFvs were more diverse than the RBD-WT specific ones, being encoded by several IGHV genes from the IGHV1 and IGHV3 families combined with short HCDR3s. Six cross-reactive scFvs and one RBD-WT specific scFv were converted to human IgG1 (hIgG1). Out of the seven antibodies, six blocked the RBD-WT binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting these antibodies may neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, one of the antibodies also recognized the RBD from the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) isolate, implying that the VH repertoire of the convalescent patient would protect against SARS-CoV-2 Wildtype, Delta, and Omicron. From a practical viewpoint, the triple cross-reactive antibody provides the substrate for developing therapeutic antibodies with a broad SARS-CoV-2 neutralization profile.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Antibodies Isolated from a SARS-CoV-2 Delta Semi-Immune Phage Display Library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst public health crisis of the century.

Differences across clusters are highlighted using detailed data on job characteristics including tasks, educational requirements and working conditions. Two clusters with favourable or average working conditions account for more than three-quarters of jobs in essential occupations. Another two clusters, comprising 20% of jobs in essential occupations, are associated with unfavourable working conditions such as low pay, job insecurity, poor prospects for advancement and low autonomy. These latter clusters exhibit high shares of migrants. An Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition is used to investigate which individual characteristics explain why migrants are more likely to have unfavourable working conditions.

The aim of this study was to determine the COVID-19 fear level of surgical nurses by using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. DESIGN: A descriptive and cross-sectional study. METHODS: Totally, 202 surgical nurses who take care of suspected or infected COVID-19 patients working in pandemic and surgical units of a university hospital were included in the study. For data collection, Nurse Characteristics Form and Fear of COVID-19 Scale were used. Study data was analyzed with the descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman Correlation test. RESULTS: The mean total COVID-19 fear score of the nurses was 25.097.29 (min:7, max: 35) and nurses who received training related to COVID-19 had statistically lower fear than those who did not (U=3773.500; p=0.027).

In the 1990s, the popularity of this herbal medicine began to attract the attention of scientists worldwide. Since then, researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba. Scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity. Using tumor cells as a cell model, corosolic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound. More recently, a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds. The ellagitannin Lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity. In a different approach, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method, Chen et al. showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin-like glucose transport inducing activity. Coupling HPLC fractionation with a glucose uptake assay, gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity, not corosolic acid. Penta-O-galloyl-glucopyranose (PGG) was identified as the most potent gallotannin. A comparison of published data with results obtained for PGG indicates that PGG has a significantly higher glucose transport stimulatory activity than Lagerstroemin. Chen et al. have also shown that PGG exhibits anti-adipogenic properties in addition to stimulating the glucose uptake in adipocytes.

METHODS Seventy-seven cases with LG epithelial tumors confirmed by histopathology (47 LGPAs and 30 LGMETs) underwent DWI and DCE-MRI. The quantitative parameters including the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the volume transfer constant (Ktrans), the efflux rate constant from the extravascular extracellular space (EES) to blood plasma (Kep), and the extravascular extracellular volume fraction (Ve) were used to differentiate LGPAs from LGMETs. Independent-samples t test was conducted to compare these parameters. The diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS Compared with LGPAs, LGMETs had significantly lower ADC value (1.090  0.169mm2/s) (P < 0.001), higher Ktrans value (0.892  0.517/min) (P = 0.001), and Kep value (1.300  1.131/min) (P = 0.002). ADC as a diagnostic index showed a better diagnostic efficacy in predicting malignant tumors (AUC 0.914, sensitivity 90.0%, specificity 85.1%, and accuracy 87.0%) than Ktrans and Kep alone. The combination of ADC and Ktrans presented the optimal diagnostic performance for the differentiation (AUC 0.938, sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 87.2%, accuracy 89.6%). CONCLUSION The quantitative parameters including ADC, Ktrans, and Kep derived from DWI and DCE-MRI might be potential imaging biomarkers in differentiating LGPAs from LGMETs.

However, the association between alcohol use in youth and change in negative affect during this unprecedented time is not clear. Using an online survey, this study obtained scores on negative affect (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic), pandemic-related stress, change in drinking frequency, and traits including resilience, impulsivity and anhedonia, from a sample of drinkers and non-drinkers, up to the age of 21. Young drinkers experienced a greater increase in negative affect during the pandemic compared to non-drinkers, and this differential rise in negative affect was mediated by the pandemic-related stress of social isolation. Young drinkers also experienced a decrease in alcohol use during the pandemic, but this was not associated with a change in negative affect. Interestingly, young drinkers with greater resilience and lower anhedonia reported less increase in negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, these results show that the greater increase in negative affect that young drinkers experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to their non-drinking counterparts, was mediated by pandemic-related social isolation. Moreover, greater resilience and lower anhedonia may have served as protective factors for mitigating the social isolation-induced worsening of negative affect in young drinkers during the pandemic. These findings may inform future studies investigating potential indicators of maladaptive affective responses to public health crises in vulnerable adolescent populations.","output":"Social Isolation-Mediated Exacerbation of Negative Affect in Young Drinkers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial disruptions in global activities. The disruptions also included intentional and unintentional reductions in health services, including immunization campaigns against the transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2). Building on a recently updated global poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model, we explored the implications of immunization disruption and restrictions of human interactions (i.e., population mixing) on the expected incidence of polio and on the resulting challenges faced by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). We demonstrate that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on January 1, 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, the GPEI could largely mitigate the impact of COVID-19 to the delays incurred. The relative importance of reduced mixing (leading to potentially decreased incidence) and reduced immunization (leading to potentially increased expected incidence) depends on the timing of the effects. Following resumption of immunization activities, the GPEI will likely face similar barriers to eradication of WPV and elimination of cVDPV2 as before COVID-19.

METHODS: A modified version of the validated Telemedicine Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire was completed by 816 individuals using crowd-sourcing methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to determine population characteristics associated with perceived difficulty using telehealth technology. RESULTS: Most respondents (85%) believed that telehealth visits would be a convenient form of healthcare delivery, and 64% would prefer them over in-person office visits. The majority (92%) agreed that telehealth would save them time, but 81% had concerns regarding the lack of physical contact during a musculoskeletal examination. More respondents would feel comfortable using telehealth for routine follow-up care (81%) compared to initial assessment visits (59%) and first postoperative appointments (60%). Roughly 1 in 15 (7%) expressed difficulty with using telehealth; these respondents were more often unmarried, lower-income, and more medically infirm, and reported greater symptoms of depression. After multivariable adjustment, lower income and poor health were retained as predictors of difficulty with navigating telehealth technology (pa?=a?0.027,pa?=a?0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: The majority of the public appears receptive to telehealth for orthopaedic care for both new patient visits and follow-up appointments.

Group A and group O individuals showed a higher and lower risk, respectively, of becoming infected. No association was observed between ABO groups and mortality. To verify this association, we performed a retrospective study of two cohorts of patients with different demographic and clinical characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 854 regular blood donors were recruited for convalescent plasma donation after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection, and a group of 965 patients more severely affected who were transfused during hospitalisation were also included. We also investigated the potential role of the different risk factors on patient outcome and death. To eliminate the confounding effect of risk factors on mortality, a propensity score analysis was performed. RESULTS: Blood group A and blood group O COVID-19 blood donors showed a higher and lower risk, respectively, for acquiring COVID-19. In contrast, this association was not found in the group of patients transfused during hospitalisation, probably due to the great differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Regarding severity, age was one of the most significant risk factors. ABO blood groups were also seen to represent important risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality. Mortality risk in group A individuals was significantly higher than in group O individuals (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.22-2.51). DISCUSSION: The association between the ABO blood groups and the susceptibility to acquire COVID-19 infection was confirmed in the group of blood donors.

DESIGN & SETTING: Published and preprint literature for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical guidelines describing the symptoms, assessment items, demographics, and/or lifestyle and health conditions associated with COVID-19 and its complications were reviewed. Corresponding clinical concepts from SNOMED CT, a widely used structured clinical vocabulary for electronic primary care health records, were identified. METHOD: Guidelines and published and unpublished reviews (N = 61) were utilised to collate a list of relevant data items for COVID-19 consultations. The NHS Digital SNOMED CT Browser was used to identify concept and descriptive identifiers. Key implementation challenges were conceptualised through a Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) lens. RESULTS: In total, 32 symptoms, eight demographic and lifestyle features, 25 health conditions, and 20 assessment items relevant to COVID-19 were identified, with proposed corresponding SNOMED CT concepts.

The current study aims to further examine the possible impact of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on in-hospital mortality. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data from the second largest insurance fund in Germany, BARMER. Patients hospitalized for ST-elevation (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, acute limb ischaemia (ALI), aortic rupture, acute stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) between January 1, 2017, and October 31, 2020, were included. Admission rates per 10,000 insured and mortality were compared between March-June 2017-2019 (pre-COVID) and March-June 2020 (COVID). Mortality rates were determined by the occurrence of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results A total of 316,718 hospitalizations were included (48.7% female, mean 72.5 years), and 21,191 (6.7%, 95% CI 6.6-6.8%) deaths occurred. In-hospital mortality increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to the three previous years for patients with acute stroke from 8.3% (95% CI 8.0-8.5) to 9.6% (95% CI 9.1-10.2) while no significant changes were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, ALI, aortic rupture, and TIA. When comparing patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.4%, 95% CI 2.3-2.5) vs. non-infected patients, a higher in-hospital mortality was observed for acute stroke (12.4% vs. 9.0%), ALI (14.3% vs. 5.0%), and TIA (2.7% vs. 0.3%) while no statistically significant differences were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, and aortic rupture. Conclusion This retrospective analysis of claims data provided hints for an association of COVID-19 pandemic with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with acute stroke. Furthermore, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased mortality in patients with stroke, TIA, and ALI.

In Canada, despite relatively high vaccine availability and uptake, willingness to accept booster shots and maintain mitigation behaviors in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 remain uncertain. The aim of the Canadian COVID-19 Experiences Project (CCEP) is two-fold: 1) to identify social-cognitive and neurocognitive correlates of vaccine hesitancy and mitigation behaviors, and 2) to identify optimal communication strategies to promote vaccination and mitigation behaviors into the post-acute phase of the pandemic. Methods and analysesThe CCEP is comprised of two components: a conventional population survey (Study 1) and a functionally interconnected laboratory study (Study 2). Study 1 will involve 3 waves of data collection. Wave 1, completed between 28 September and 21 October, 2021, recruited 1,958 vaccine-hesitant (49.8%) and fully vaccinated (50.2%) adults using quota sampling to ensure maximum statistical power. Measures included a variety of social cognitive (e.g., beliefs, intentions) and neurocognitive (e.g., delay discounting) measures, followed by an opportunity to view and rate a set of professionally produced COVID-19 public service announcement (PSA) videos for perceived efficacy. Study 2 employs the same survey items and PSAs but coupled with lab-based eye tracking and functional brain imaging to directly quantify neural indicators of attention capture and self-reflection in a smaller community sample. In the final phase of the project, subjective impressions and neural indicators of PSA efficacy will be compared and used to inform recommendations for construction of COVID-19 PSAs into the post-acute phase of the pandemic.

The aim of our study was to describe the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate such observations with the thromboprophylaxis received. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 67 patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. The diagnosis was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal specimens. The deep veins were examined using compression duplex ultrasonography with the transducer on B-mode. The patients were separated into two groups for statistical analysis: those receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis and those receiving intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment. Risk analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients, 57 were included in the present study after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria; 49.1% were women, and the patient mean age was 71.3 years. All 57 patients had undergone compression duplex ultrasonography. Of these 57 patients, 6 were diagnosed with DVT, for an in-hospital rate of DVT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia of 10.5%. All the patients who had presented with DVT had been receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. The patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation treatment had a greater risk of DVT (16.21%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.28; P = .056) compared with those receiving intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment. We also found a protective factor for DVT in the intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment group (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.46; P < .05).

A resulting change in pediatric fracture epidemiology is expected. This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fracture incidence and characteristics. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study comparing acute fractures presenting to a single level I pediatric trauma hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic with fractures during a prepandemic period at the same institution. The \\"pandemic\\" cohort was gathered from March 15 to April 15, 2020 and compared with a \\"prepandemic\\" cohort from the same time window in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS In total, 1745 patients presenting with acute fractures were included. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of fractures presenting to our practice during the pandemic (22.59.1/d vs. 9.65.1/d, P<0.001). The presenting age for all fractures decreased during the pandemic (7.54.3 vs. 9.44.4 y, P<0.001) because of decreased fracture burden among adolescents. There were also a decrease in the number of fractures requiring surgery (2.21.8/d vs. 0.80.8/d, P<0.001). During the pandemic, there was an increase in the proportion of injuries occurring at home (57.8% vs. 32.5%, P<0.001) or on bicycles (18.3% vs. 8.2%, P<0.001), but a decrease in those related to sports (7.2% vs. 26.0%, P<0.001) or playgrounds (5.2% vs. 9.0%, P<0.001). There was no increase in time-to-presentation. Patients with distal radius torus fractures were more likely to receive a velcro splint during the pandemic (44.2% vs. 25.9%, P=0.010). CONCLUSIONS Pediatric fracture volume has decreased 2.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially because of cessation of organized sports and decreased playground use. In endemic regions, lower trauma volume may allow redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons and staff to other clinical arenas. Given the rising proportion of bicycling injuries, an emphasis on basic safety precautions could improve public health. An observed increase in the prescription of velcro splints for distal radius fractures highlights an opportunity for simplified patient care during the pandemic.

However, they work for long hours and need to wear a mask and other personal protective equipment, which causes their protective eye wear to fog up. This fogging up of eye wear, in turn, has a substantial impact in the speed and accuracy of reading information on the interface of electrocardiogram (ECG) machines. To gain a better understanding of the extent of the impact, this study experimentally simulates the fogging of protective goggles when viewing the interface with three variables: the degree of fogging of the goggles, brightness of the screen, and color of the font of the cardiovascular readings. This experimental study on the target recognition of digital font is carried out by simulating the interface of an ECG machine and readability of the ECG machine with fogged eye wear. The experimental results indicate that the fogging of the lenses has a significant impact on the recognition speed and the degree of fogging has a significant correlation with the font color and brightness of the screen. With a reduction in screen brightness, its influence on recognition speed shows a v-shaped trend, and the response time is the shortest when the screen brightness is 150 cd/m2. When eyewear is fogged, yellow and green font colors allow a quicker response with a higher accuracy. On the whole, the subjects show a better performance with the use of green font, but there are inconsistencies. In terms of the interaction among the three variables, the same results are also found and the same conclusion can be made accordingly.

Here, we established a clinically relevant mouse model of SAE and investigated the role of extracellular miRNAs and their sensor Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in brain inflammation and neurological dysfunction. We observed BBB disruption and a profound neuroinflammatory responses in the brain for up to 14 days post-sepsis; these included increased pro-inflammatory cytokines production, microglial expansion, and peripheral leukocyte accumulation in the CNS.

However, there is still a lack of research showing long-term trajectories of mental health across different stages of the pandemic. And little is known regarding the longitudinal association of time-varying contextual and individual factors (e.g. COVID-19 policy response and pandemic intensity) with mental health outcomes. This study aimed to provide a longitudinal profile of how depressive and anxiety symptoms changed by month between March 2020 and April 2022, and to examine their longitudinal associations with time-varying contextual and individual level factors. Methods and findings: Drawing data from a large panel study of over 58,000 adults living in England, we showed that mental health changes were largely in line with changes in COVID-19 policy response and pandemic intensity. Further, data were analysed using fixed-effects, with models fitted separately across three stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that more stringent policy response was associated with increased mental health symptoms, in particular during lockdown periods. Higher COVID-19 deaths were also associated with poorer mental health, but this association weakened over time. Finally, there was also evidence for the longitudinal association of mental health with individual level factors, including confidence in government/healthcare/essentials, COVID-19 knowledge, COVID-19 stress, COVID-19 infection and social support. Conclusions: Our results provided empirical evidence on how changes in contextual and individual level factors were related to depressive and anxiety symptoms. While some factors clearly acted as consistent predictors of mental health during a pandemic, other factors were dependent on the specific situations occurring within society. This could provide important implications for policy making and for a better understanding of mental health of the general public during a national or global health crisis.","output":"Depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A two-year follow-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater is a promising tool for informing public health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Concentration estimates reported by individual laboratories were consistently within a 1.0-log(10) range for aliquots of the same spiked condition. All laboratories distinguished between low- and high-spikes for both surrogates.

According to transactional theory, coping strategies and personal factors have psychological impacts. We hypothesized that behavioral responses to COVID-19 (problem-focused coping) are more effective in reducing psychological impacts than emotional responses to COVID-19 (emotion-focused coping). Independent variables were the use of behavioral and emotional coping strategies for COVID-19 and 3 personal factors, namely sleep disturbance, physical component summary (PCS-12), and mental component summary (MCS-12) of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) obtained from the Medical Outcomes Study. Dependent variables comprised 3 psychological impacts, namely MDD, PTS, and pessimism. Results: We determined that behavioral coping strategies had significant negative effects on PTS and pessimism; however, emotional coping strategies had significantly positive effects on PTS and pessimism. Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with increased MDD and pessimism. PCS-12 had a significant negative effect on PTS, whereas MCS-12 was not significantly associated with any of the 3 psychological impacts. Conclusions: Nurses who adopted protective behavior against COVID-19, such as washing hands, wearing masks, avoiding touching eyes, and mouth, and avoiding personal contact, were associated with less posttraumatic stress and pessimism. Healthcare providers should consider strategies for improving preventive behaviors to help ease their worries and fears concerning COVID-19.","output":"Protective Behaviors for COVID-19 Were Associated With Fewer Psychological Impacts on Nurses: A Cross-Sectional Study in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Medical and socio-economic uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have had a substantial impact on the mental health. This study aimed to systematically review the existing literature reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general populace in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine associated risk factors.Methods: The study adopted a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. African Journal Online, CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from database inception until August 2021 for primary studies reporting the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among the general populace in African settings. Published systematic reviews, review protocols and conference abstracts were excluded. Two authors independently conducted the methodological quality assessment using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Summary data on the prevalence of anxiety and depression were also independently extracted by two authors. Meta-analyses on prevalence rates were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. The review protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021228023). Findings: Seventy-eight primary studies (62,380 participants) were identified from 2,325 studies via electronic and manual searches. Pooled prevalence rates for anxiety (47%, 95% CI:40-54%, I2 =9919%) and depression (48%, 95% CI:39-57%, I2 =9945%) were reported across Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sex (female) and history of existing medical/chronic conditions were identified as major risk factors for anxiety and depression.Interpretation: To our knowledge, this is the first review to examinevalee prnce rates and risk factors associated with anxiety and depression among the general African populace during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence put forth in this synthesis demonstrates the substantial impact of the pandemic on the pervasiveness of these psychological symptoms among the general population.

AIM: To describe RSV seasonality in 13 European countries and examine its association with meteorological factors. METHODS: We included weekly RSV seasonality data from 13 European countries between week 40 2010 and week 39 2019. Using local weighted regression method, we modelled weekly RSV activity with meteorological factors using data from the 2010/11 to the 2017/18 season. We predicted the weekly RSV activity of the 2018/19 season across 41 European countries and validated our prediction using empirical data. RESULTS: All countries had annual wintertime RSV seasons with a longitudinal gradient in RSV onset (Pearsons correlation coefficient, r = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.80). The RSV season started 3.8 weeks later (95% CI: ?0.5 to 8.0) in countries in the eastern vs western parts of Europe, and the duration ranged from 8C18 weeks across seasons and countries. Lower temperature and higher relative humidity were associated with higher RSV activity, with a 14-day lag time. Through external validation, the prediction error in RSV season onset was ?2.4  3.2 weeks. Similar longitudinal gradients in RSV onset were predicted by our model for the 2018/19 season (r = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.66). CONCLUSION: Meteorological factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, could be used for early warning of RSV season onset.

The pandemic highlights an urgent need for a stable, easily produced, and effective vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to bind its cognate receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and initiate membrane fusion. Thus, the RBD is an ideal target for vaccine development. In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticle vaccine candidates, namely, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer), and RBD-I53C50 (120-mer), via covalent conjugation using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. When mice were immunized with the RBD-conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) in conjunction with the AddaVax or Sigma Adjuvant System, the resulting antisera exhibited 8- to 120-fold greater neutralizing activity against both a pseudovirus and the authentic virus than those of mice immunized with monomeric RBD. Most importantly, sera from mice immunized with RBD-conjugated NPs more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 in vitro, further corroborating the promising immunization effect. Additionally, the vaccine has distinct advantages in terms of a relatively simple scale-up and flexible assembly. These results illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticles developed in this study are a competitive vaccine candidate and that the carrier nanoparticles could be adopted as a universal platform for a future vaccine development.","output":"Rapid Development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor-Binding Domain Self-Assembled Nanoparticle Vaccine Candidates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global scientific fight to defeat the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has led to what is already called an infodemic or an over abundance of information in this era of digital communication linked to post-truth Thus, to the thousands of scientific articles published, millions of tweets or videos are added with different degrees of precision or veracity In this study, the authors reflect on these social behaviours from a linguistic-semiotic perspective, through the critical analysis of a corpus of approximately 800 memes, habitual ?cultural units? in digital discourse, that have circulated on WhatsApp in Spain during the state of alarm decreed by the central government from March 14 to June 21, 2020 Following the postulates of Sperber and Wilson's Theory of Relevance (1986;2004;2012, etc ), we analyze the iconic or textual characteristics that serve as communicative clues in these ?multimodal? texts The analysis leads to a description of the cognitive effects intended through the common vehicle of humor, which lead us to classify them from \\"vindicatory and critical\\" (political or social criticism, depending on ideological beliefs and positions), \\"emotional\\" (driven by solidarity, empathy, gratitude, compassion ), ?ludic?

Ischemic tissue damage with oxygen deficiency, which starts with the decrease in blood flow to the tissue, continues to increase with the reoxygenation of the damaged tissues as soon as reperfusion is achieved. In various studies, osthole has also been shown to reduce cerebral, spinal cord, intestinal, renal, and myocardial ischemia/perfusion (I/R) damage. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of osthole on testicular I/R injury. METHODS: 28 Wistar-albino rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups (n=7). Group 1 was the sham operation group. In Group 2 (I/R), 3-h ischemia was created by rotating the testis 720 clockwise, followed by 3 h of reperfusion. In Group 3 (I/R + single dose of Osthole), 20 mg/kg ostol was administered intraperitoneally half an hour before detorsion after 3 h of torsion. The testis was detorsioned. Three h of detorsion was applied. In Group 4 (I/R + twice doses of Osthole), 20 mg/kg ostol was administered intraperitoneally half an hour before detorsion, followed by 3-h torsion. The testis was released and detorsioned. Half an hour after the detorsion, an intraperitoneal dose of 20 mg/kg osthole was administered again. Detorsion was done for 3 h. All rats were sacrificed after 6 h and right orchiectomy was performed for blood for biochemical analysis and histopathological sample. RESULTS: Glutathion, nuclear respiratory factor 2, Superoxide dismutase, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels were decreased in I/R rats, while interleukin-6, malondialdehyde, and myeloperoxidase levels were increased. While caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and TUNEL showed moderate immunopositive tissues immunohistochemically in rats with I/R damage, mild immunopositive tissues were detected in Group 3 and Group 4. In the histochemical examination, degenerative tubule structure and separation of epithelial cells were observed in I/R rats, while partially healed testicular tissue was detected in Group 3 and Group 4. CONCLUSION: In our study, we observed that osthole reduced oxidative damage, suppressed the inflammatory process, prevented apoptosis, and reduced cell damage.

METHODS An online anonymised survey was distributed via the British Society of Skeletal Radiology (BSSR) members forum in November 2020. Responses were collated using a standardised Google form including 21 questions. RESULTS 135 members of the BSSR completed the survey. 85% of respondents stopped performing corticosteroid injections (CSI) during the initial lockdown of the pandemic. This was primarily influenced by national guidelines. The majority of respondents initially abstained from offered CSI procedures, then by November 2020, 69% of respondents were providing CSI for high and low risk patients, 23% were only providing CSI for low-risk patients with 8% still not performing any CSI. 40% of respondents reported routinely obtaining specific written consent regarding the risk of COVID-19. Approximately, 11,000 CSI were performed by respondents between March and November 2020 with no reported significant COVID-19-related complications. Over 80% of BSSR members reported that the number of CSI procedures that they performed dropped by more than 80% compared to usual. 73% of respondents reported an increased backlog of patients awaiting treatment. The average waiting time for routine outpatient CSI treatment was > 12 weeks in 53% of responses, compared to 34% the previous year. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the clinical practices of MSK radiologists in the UK. Our survey highlights the rapid response of BSSR members as national guidelines evolved. Currently, the majority of respondents are performing CSI for musculoskeletal conditions when clinically indicated, with enhanced consent.

The purpose of this study was to examine survival characteristics in patients suffering torso trauma with no recorded vital signs (VS) in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was analyzed from 2007 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were patients with blunt and penetrating torso trauma without VS in the ED. Patients with head injuries, transfers from other hospitals, or those with missing values were excluded. The characteristics of survivors were evaluated, and statistical analyses performed. RESULTS: A total of 24,191 torso trauma patients without VS were evaluated in the ED and 96.6% were declared dead upon arrival. There were 246 survivors (1%), and 73 (0.3%) were eventually discharged home. Of patients who responded to resuscitation (812), the survival rate was 30.3%. Injury severity score (ISS), penetrating mechanism (odds ratio [OR] 1.99), definitive chest (OR 1.59) and abdominal surgery (OR 1.49) were associated with improved survival. Discharge to home (or police custody) was associated with lower ISS (OR 0.975) and shorter ED time (OR 0.99). CONCLUSION: Over a recent nine-year period in the United States, nearly 25,000 trauma patients were treated at trauma centers despite lack of VS. Of these patients, only 73 were discharged home.

RECENT FINDINGS Radiomics involves the high-throughput extraction of radiologic features from clinical imaging, using a panel of sophisticated data-characterization algorithms to make an objective and quantitative determination of diagnoses and clinical characteristics. Radiomics evaluation of existing clinical images would increase their clinical value in many cancer management pathways, including PCa. However, a consensus on the implementation of radiomics has not been established across different sites, delaying its implementation in clinical practice. There are many potential advantages to radiomics. The ability to extract features from existing clinical imaging is one such advantage. A second is the empiric nature of the analysis. The third lies in the application of new technologies, such as machine learning, to be able to evaluate large quantities of data to make clinical conclusions. In this systematic review, we identify publications regarding the role of radiomics in PCa detection and evaluation. Many of these studies noted that radiomics, when incorporated into predictive models, had an advantageous impact on detection of PCa, clinically significant PCa, and extracapsular extension. This may assist in individualized decision making not only for diagnosis of PCa, but also for surveillance and surgical planning. With additional validation in large sample sizes, and randomized, multicenter studies using a consensus driven methodology, radiomics has the potential to alter the landscape of PCa detection and management, necessitating further prospective randomized investigation. SUMMARY Radiomics is a promising new field, allowing for high-throughput analysis of imaging features for PCa detection and evaluation.

The stacked platform comprises two components: a) an unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder that learns an optimal representation of the time-series, using it to differentiate the less frequent patterns which conclude with an adverse event from the majority patterns that do not, and b) a gradient boosting model, which relies on the constructed representation to refine prediction, incorporating static features of demographics, admission details and clinical summaries. The model is used to assess a patient's risk of adversity over time and provides visual justifications of its prediction based on the patient's static features and dynamic signals. Results of three case studies for predicting mortality and ICU admission show that the model outperforms all existing outcome prediction models, achieving PR-AUC of 0.891 (95$%$ CI: 0.878 - 0.969) in predicting mortality in ICU and general ward settings and 0.908 (95$%$ CI: 0.870-0.935) in predicting ICU admission.","output":"A Knowledge Distillation Ensemble Framework for Predicting Short and Long-term Hospitalisation Outcomes from Electronic Health Records Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the present study, the whole human genome oligo microarray was employed to investigate the gene expression profile in symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: Twenty patients with PE and 20 age and gender matched patients without PE as controls were enrolled into the present study in the same period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the clinical manifestations and findings on imaging examinations. Acute arterial and/or venous thrombosis was excluded in controls. The whole human genome oligo microarray was employed for detection. Statistical analysis was performed with t test following analysis of very small samples of repeated measurements and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. RESULTS: Genomic data showed no damage to vascular endothelial cells in PE patients. Genomic data only found increased mRNA expression of a small amount of coagulation factors in PE patients. In the PE group, anticoagulant proteins, Fibrinolytic system and proteins related to platelet functions only played partial roles in the pathogenesis of PE. In addition, the mRNA expressions of a fraction of adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated. Gene Ontology analysis showed the genes with down-regulated expressions mainly explain the compromised T cell immunity. Symptomatic VTE patients have compromised T cell immunity. CONCLUSION: The damage to vascular endothelial cells is not necessary in the pathogenesis of VTE, and only a fraction of factors involved in the shared coagulation cascade are activated.

This study was performed to determine the relationship between job stress and safety climate factors in the occurrence of accidents using the Bayesian network model. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 1530 male workers of Asaluyeh petrochemical company in Iran. The participants were asked to complete the questionnaires, including demographical information and accident history questionnaire, NIOSH generic job stress questionnaire, and Nordic safety climate questionnaire. Also, work experience and the accident history data were inquired from the petrochemical health unit. Finally, the relationships between the variables were investigated using the Bayesian network model. RESULTS: A high job stress condition could decrease the high safety climate from 53 to 37% and increase the accident occurrence from 72 to 94%. Moreover, a low safety climate condition could increase the accident occurrence from 72 to 93%. Also, the concurrent high job stress and low safety climate could raise the accident occurrence from 72 to 93%. Among the associations between the job stress factor and safety climate dimensions, the job stress and workers safety priority and risk non-acceptance (0.19) had the highest mean influence value. CONCLUSION: The adverse effect of high job stress conditions on accident occurrence is twofold. It can directly increase the accident occurrence probability and in another way, it can indirectly increase the accident occurrence probability by causing the safety climate to go to a lower level.","output":"A Bayesian network based study on determining the relationship between job stress and safety climate factors in occurrence of accidents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a prospective, mobile-based survey on the self-reported adverse reactions in healthcare workers (HCWs) who received both doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

Little is known, however, about specific positive and negative individual and organizational factors that affect the mental health of emergency physicians (EP) during COVID-19. Our objective was to assess these factors in a broad geographic sample of EPs in the United States. METHODS: We conducted an electronic, prospective, cross-sectional national survey of EPs from October 6CDecember 29, 2020. Measures assessed negative mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia), positive work-related outcomes, and strategies used to cope with COVID-19. After preliminary analyses and internal reliability testing, we performed four separate three-stage hierarchical multiple regression analyses to examine individual and organizational predictive factors for psychological distress. RESULTS: Response rate was 50%, with 517 EPs completing the survey from 11 different sites. Overall, 85% of respondents reported negative psychological effects due to COVID-19. Participants reported feeling more stressed (31%), lonelier (26%), more anxious (25%), more irritable (24%) and sadder (17.5%). Prevalence of mental health conditions was 17% for depression, 13% for anxiety, 7.5% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 18% for insomnia. Regular exercise decreased from 69% to 56%, while daily alcohol use increased from 8% to 15%. Coping strategies of behavioral disengagement, self-blame, and venting were significant predictors of psychological distress, while humor and positive reframing were negatively associated with psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Emergency physicians have experienced high levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But on the other hand, reports of self-harm and increased ER visits for self-harm suggest other psychological difficulties. Inability to handle anxiety following surgical weight loss has alarming potential ramifications for these gastric surgery patients. In the present study, we used models of diet-induced obesity and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) to ask whether anxiety behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis gene changes were affected by surgical weight loss under two diet regimens: i.e. low-fat diet (LFD) and high-fat diet (HFD). We show reduced exploratory behavior in the open field test but increased time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, we show increased plasma levels of corticosterone in female VSG recipients in the estrus phase and increased levels of hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin (avp), pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc), and tyrosine hydroxylase (th).

In recent years, cannabinoids have been investigated extensively due to their potential effects on the human body. Among all cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of pathological conditions. Therefore, it is logical to explore whether CBD can reduce the cytokine storm and treat ARDS. Materials and Methods: In this study, we show that intranasal application of Poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA, simulated symptoms of severe viral infections inducing signs of ARDS and cytokine storm. Discussion: The administration of CBD downregulated the level of proinflammatory cytokines and ameliorated the clinical symptoms of Poly I:C-induced ARDS.

The major challenge to control this pandemic is the rapid mutation rate of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, leading to the escape of the protection of vaccines and most of the neutralizing antibodies to date. Thus, it is pivotal to develop neutralizing antibodies with broad-spectrum activity targeting multiple SARS-Cov-2 variants. Here, we first got a synthetic nanobody(named C5) which could interfere with ACE2 binding to SARS-Cov-2 spike protein and its RBD domain. The affinity matured format of C5 clone, named C5G2, has a single digit nanomolar affinity to RBD domain and inhibit its binding to ACE2 with an IC50 of 3.7 nM. Pseudovirus assay indicated that the monovalent C5G2 could protect the cells from the infection of SARS-Cov-2 wild type virus and most of the virus of concern, i.e. Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Omicron variants. Strikingly, C5G2 has the highest potency against omicron among all the variants with the IC50 of 4.9ng/ml(0.3n M). We further solved the Cryo-EM structure of C5G2 in complex with the Spike trimer. The structure data showed that C5G2 bind to RBD mainly through its CDR3 at a vast region that not overlapping with the ACE2 binding surface. Surprisingly, C5G2 also bind to a distinct epitope residing in the NTD domain of spike protein through the same CDR3 loop, which may further increase its potency against the virus infection. Thus, this bi-paratopic nanobody may be served as an effective drug for the prophylaxis and therapy of the Omicron infection.","output":"A high potent synthetic nanobody with broad-spectrum activity neutralizes SARS-Cov-2 virus and Omicron variant through a unique binding mode"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a retrospective single-center study of 417 consecutive patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital in Kuwait between February 24, 2020 and May 24, 2020.

Patients with worse outcomes have exhibited higher blood plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Activation of the vitamin D receptor expressed on immune cells has been shown to directly reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, and indirectly affect C-reactive protein. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: The significance of the vitamin D pathway in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION: Vitamin D supplementation in patients after diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: We report 4 vitamin D deficient patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in April 2020 who were provided with either cholecalciferol of 1000 IU daily (standard dose) or ergocalciferol 50,000 IU daily for 5 days (high dose) as part of supplementation. CLINICAL OUTCOMES: Patients that received a high dose of vitamin D supplementation achieved normalization of vitamin D levels and improved clinical recovery evidenced by shorter lengths of stay, lower oxygen requirements, and a reduction in inflammatory marker status. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may serve as a viable alternative for curtailing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients in underserved communities where resources to expensive and sought-after medications may be scarce.

The potential of a phytotherapeutic approach in the management of the dreaded disease has gained attention, especially in developing countries, with several claims of the development of anti-COVID-19 herbal formulations. This is a plausible approach especially with the increasing acceptance of herbal medicine in both alternative and orthodox medical practices worldwide. Also, the established efficacy of herbal remedies in the treatment of numerous viral diseases including those caused by coronaviruses, as well as diseases with symptoms associated with COVID-19, presents a valid case for serious consideration of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.

The latter is relevant no matter the actual state of the rock glacier (intact, containing ice versus relict, no more ice present). A nation-wide comparison of the water equivalent of glacier ice within the Austrian Alps is conducted to evaluate the role of rock glaciers in the hydrological cycle at its current state and potentially in the future. Estimates of ice volumes and their uncertainties, especially related to thickness estimates of permafrost-ice bodies, are discussed in the light of available data and need to be seen as order-of-magnitude estimates. With intact rock glaciers covering almost 123 km2 and an assumed ice content of 40% within the permafrost body, ice volumes are estimated to be 0.93 Gigatons. This corresponds to 8.3% of the ice volume estimated for the most recent glacier inventory of the Austrian Alps. Thus, with the currently available data, a water equivalent ratio of ~1: 12 for rock glacier ice versus glacier ice is estimated. In addition to the solid water storage, the dynamic storage potential within rock glaciers in liquid form needs to be considered. While this volume is relatively small compared to the ice volume in glaciers and rock glaciers (ratio of ~1: 20), the time-scales of hydrological relevance (when they become runoff due to ice melt) are very different. This dynamic liquid water storage is replenishable and therefore available over shorter time scales (seasonal drainage pattern), and moreover relatively stable and may potentially even slightly increase as pore space becomes available due to increased melting of permafrost ice. In the light of climate warming and projected glacier recession, the relative hydrological importance of rock glaciers as water stores (in solid as well as in liquid form) in the European Alps is expected to increase and their storage-discharge patterns need to be accounted for in water management considerations.","output":"Assessment of liquid and solid water storage in rock glaciers versus glacier ice in the Austrian Alps."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, which emerged as a global pandemic.

We used logistic regression to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for associations between independent variables and risk of seronegativity following two vaccine doses. Participants who were seronegative after receiving two vaccine doses were offered an additional antibody test following subsequent administration of a booster dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) from September 23 to December 12, 2021. Findings: Serology results following two vaccine doses were available for 9,101 participants, of whom 5,770 (63.4%) received ChAdOx1 and 3,331 (36.6%) received BNT162b2. Anti-spike IgGAM was undetectable in 378 (4.2%) participants at a median of 8.6 weeks (IQR 6.4-10.7 weeks) after their second dose of vaccine. Seronegativity following two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was associated with administration of ChAdOx1 vs BNT162b2 (aOR 7.03, 95% CI 4.39-11.24), shorter interval between first and second vaccine doses (aOR 2.37, 1.06-5.26, for <6 weeks vs >10 weeks; aOR 1.59, 1.18-2.13, for 6-10 weeks vs >10 weeks), poorer self-assessed general health (aOR 3.33, 1.49-7.46, for poor vs excellent), immunodeficiencies (aOR 6.75, 2.63-17.35) and prescription of systemic immunosuppressants (aOR 3.76, 2.44-5.78). By contrast, pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (aOR 0.16, 0.04-0.70, for symptomatic seropositives vs seronegatives) and supplemental vitamin D intake (aOR 0.73, 0.53-0.99) were associated with reduced risk of post-vaccination seronegativity. 247/378 (65.3%) of participants who were seronegative after two doses of ChAdOx1 vs BNT162b2 provided a third sample at a median of 7.8 weeks (IQR 5.8-10.4) after receiving a booster dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273: eight (3.2%) of them remained seronegative after three vaccine doses, all of whom either had a primary immunodeficiency or were taking systemic immunosuppressant drugs. Interpretation: We identify multiple determinants of antibody responses to two doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2, many of which are potentially modifiable. Booster doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 were highly effective in achieving seroconversion in those who failed to mount antibody responses following two doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2.","output":"Determinants of antibody responses to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 and a subsequent booster dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273: population-based cohort study (COVIDENCE UK)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the great success of vaccines that protect against RNA virus infections and the development and clinical use of a limited number of RNA virus-specific drugs, there is still an urgent need for new classes of antiviral drugs against circulating or emerging RNA viruses.

It is a respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was initially reported in late December 2019. In a span of 6 months, this pandemic spread across the globe leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Soon after the identification of the causative virus, questions concerning the impact of environmental factors on the dissemination and transmission of the virus, its persistence in environmental matrices, and infectivity potential begin to emerge. As the environmental factors could have far-reaching consequences on infection dissemination and severity, it is essential to understand the linkage between these factors and the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to improve our current understanding over this topic, the present article summarizes topical and substantial observations made regarding the influences of abiotic environmental factors such as climate, temperature, humidity, wind speed, air, and water quality, solid surfaces/interfaces, frozen food, and biotic factors like age, sex, gender, blood type, population density, behavioural characteristics, etc. on the transmission, persistence, and infectivity of this newly recognized SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further, the potential pathways of virus transmission that could pose risk to population health have been discussed, and the critical areas have been identified which merits urgent research for the assessment and management of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Other coronaviruses are causing epizootic representing a significant threat for both domestic and wild animals. Members of this viral family have the longest genome of all RNA viruses, and express up to 29 proteins establishing complex interactions with the host proteome. Deciphering these interactions is essential to identify cellular pathways hijacked by these viruses to replicate and escape innate immunity. Virus-host interactions also provide key information to select targets for antiviral drug development. Here, we have manually curated the literature to assemble a unique dataset of 1311 coronavirus-host protein-protein interactions. Functional enrichment and network-based analyses showed coronavirus connections to RNA processing and translation, DNA damage and pathogen sensing, interferon production, and metabolic pathways. In particular, this global analysis pinpointed overlooked interactions with translation modulators (GIGYF2-EIF4E2), components of the nuclear pore, proteins involved in mitochondria homeostasis (PHB, PHB2, STOML2), and methylation pathways (MAT2A/B). Finally, interactome data provided a rational for the antiviral activity of some drugs inhibiting coronaviruses replication.

To determine the mechanisms that prevent virus spreading through the blood-brain barrier, we analyzed expression of MHVR, a glycoprotein that serves as receptor for mouse hepatitis virus on endothelial cells of cerebral blood vessels. Our results indicated that MHVR was strongly expressed on the endoluminal pole of these cells. In addition, a direct virus binding assay showed that mouse hepatitis virus was able to bind endothelial cells via this receptor. Despite this expression of a functional viral receptor, in normal mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus by the contra-peritoneal route, no in vivo viral replication could be detected in endothelial cells from the brain, contrasting with the equivalent cells from the liver. However, shortly after i.v. administration of sodium dodecylsulfate detergent to the mice, virus infection of some cerebral endothelial cells was detected in a few mice. As a consequence of detergent treatment, virus infection was able to cross the blood-brain barrier. These results suggest that the protective role of the blood-brain barrier against spreading of mouse hepatitis virus A59 into the central nervous system is determined by a specific restriction of viral entry into the endothelial cells of cerebral origin.","output":"Role of virus receptor-bearing endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier in preventing the spread of mouse hepatitis virus-A59 into the central nervous system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper reviews briefly notable examples of e-learning, specifically the pioneering projects in medical physics and engineering.

The majority of current point-of-care antibody tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on lateral flow assays, but these do not offer quantitative information. To address this, we developed a novel antibody test leveraging hemagglutination, employing a dry card format currently used for typing ABO blood groups. Two hundred COVID-19 patient and 200 control plasma samples were reconstituted with O-negative red blood cells (RBCs) to form whole blood and added to dried viral-antibody fusion protein, followed by a stirring step and a tilting step, 3-min incubation, and a second tilting step. The sensitivities of the hemagglutination test, Euroimmun IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and receptor binding domain (RBD)-based CoronaChek lateral flow assay were 87.0%, 86.5%, and 84.5%, respectively, using samples obtained from recovered COVID-19 individuals. Testing prepandemic samples, the hemagglutination test had a specificity of 95.5%, compared to 97.3% and 98.9% for the ELISA and CoronaChek, respectively. A distribution of agglutination strengths was observed in COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma samples, with the highest agglutination score (4) exhibiting significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than weak positives (2) (P < 0.0001). Strong agglutinations were observed within 1 min of testing, and this shorter assay time also increased specificity to 98.5%. In conclusion, we developed a novel rapid, point-of-care RBC agglutination test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that can yield semiquantitative information on neutralizing antibody titer in patients.

We aimed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from human adipose-derived MSCs (haMSC-Exos) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The MEXCOVID trial is a phase 2a single-arm, open-labelled, interventional trial and patients were enrolled in Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Eligible 7 patients were assigned to receive the daily dose of haMSCs-Exos (2.0  10(8) nano vesicles) for consecutively 5 days. The primary outcomes included the incidence of prespecified inhalation-associated events and serious adverse events. We also observed the demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory results including lymphocyte count, levels of D-dimer and IL-6 as well as chest imaging. RESULTS: Seven severe COVID-19 related pneumonia patients (4 males and 3 females) were enrolled and received nebulized haMSC-Exos. The median age was 57 year (interquartile range (IQR), 43 year to 70 year). The median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission and administration of nebulized haMSC-Exos was 30 days (IQR, 15 days to 40 days) and 54 d (IQR, 34 d to 69 d), respectively. All COVID-19 patients tolerated the haMSC-Exos nebulization well, with no evidence of prespecified adverse events or clinical instability during the nebulization or during the immediate post-nebulization period. All patients presented a slight increase of serum lymphocyte counts (median as 1.61  10(9)/L vs. 1.78  10(9)/L).

Our data of community dwelling older adults (aged 60-92) is unique in that it allowed for an investigation of psychological variables that increase and decrease negative outcomes during the pandemic. Our longitudinal study examined the influence of pre-pandemic anxiety and resiliency on the severity of COVID related stress.

During the pandemic we measured the severity of COVID related stressors. We hypothesized that anxiety would predict higher level of COVID-stress, whereas resiliency would be associated with decreased severity of COVID-stress. Further we predicted that resiliency would attenuate the association between anxiety and COVID-stress. RESULTS: Using OLS regression, we found that anxiety predicted higher COVID-stress, whereas resiliency predicted lower COVID-stress. However, resiliency did not moderate the association between anxiety and COVID-stress.

Metabolites such as amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids are central to viral proteins, genomes, and envelopes, and the availability of these molecules can restrict or promote infection. Polyamines, comprised of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in mammalian cells, are also critical for virus infection. Polyamines are small, positively charged molecules that function in transcription, translation, and cell cycling. Initial work on the function of polyamines in bacteriophage infection illuminated these molecules as critical to virus infection. In the decades since early virus-polyamine descriptions, work on diverse viruses continues to highlight a role for polyamines in viral processes, including genome packaging and viral enzymatic activity. On the host side, polyamines function in the response to virus infection. Thus, viruses and hosts compete for polyamines, which are a critical resource for both.

The adhesive activity of VWF multimers is regulated by a specific metalloprotease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13). Increasing evidence indicates that the interaction between NETs and VWF contributes to arterial and venous thrombosis as well as inflammation. Furthermore, contents released from activated neutrophils or NETs induce the reduction of ADAMTS13 activity, which may occur in both thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Recently, NET is considered as a driver of endothelial damage and immunothrombosis in COVID-19. In addition, the levels of VWF and ADAMTS13 can predict the mortality of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the biological characteristics and interactions of NETs, VWF, and ADAMTS13, and discuss their roles in TMAs, AIS, and COVID-19.

Instead, C6orf106 interacts with IRF3 and inhibits IRF3 recruitment to type I IFN promoter sequences while also reducing the nuclear levels of the coactivator proteins p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). In summary, we have defined C6orf106 as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity that blocks IRF3-dependent cytokine production via a noncanonical and poorly defined mechanism. This work presents intriguing implications for antiviral immunity, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.","output":"C6orf106 is a novel inhibitor of the interferon-regulatory factor 3-dependent innate antiviral response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In low anterior resections, anastomosis continues to present major problems. Although the single-stapling technique (SST) is considered to be superior to the double-staple technique (DST) in terms of leakage and stenosis, SST requires suturing, which is particularly difficult during laparoscopic surgery. A simpler and safer method of anastomosis is needed. In this study, we developed a pre-ligation SST (L-SST) that does not require suturing and evaluated the usefulness of L-SST in an ex vivo and an in vivo porcine model. METHODS Porcine rectums were ligated using SurgiTie? and sharply resected instead of using a linear stapler. The burst pressures of the closed rectums after using a linear stapler and SurgiTie? (each group; n = 5) and the burst pressures of the anastomoses performed with L-SST and DST (each group; n = 4) were measured. During in vivo porcine laparoscopic surgery, we performed and evaluated the feasibility of L-SST. RESULTS After completing the anastomosis with L-SST, the ligated portion using SurgiTie? was completely removed. The stump closed using SurgiTie? was much stronger than that closed using a stapler (131.2 and 25.6 mmHg, respectively; P = 0.01). The average burst pressure of the anastomoses performed with L-SST was 33.8 mmHg, whereas that performed with DST was 30.5 mmHg. We did not find significant difference between these two groups (P = 0.88). We also confirmed the feasibility of L-SST in an in vivo porcine laparoscopic surgery model. CONCLUSION We developed a novel SST, the L-SST. We were able to perform L-SST successfully using an ex vivo porcine rectum and during in vivo porcine laparoscopic surgery.","output":"A novel single-stapling technique for colorectal anastomosis: a pre-ligation single-stapling technique (L-SST) in a porcine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Continuous positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) was recommended by NHS England for patients with COVID-19 and hypoxaemic respiratory failure either as a ceiling of treatment, trial to avoid intubation or as a bridge to intubation 1 However, In the absence of clinical trials, its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is poorly understood We collected observational data on outcomes of patients with COVID-19 requiring CPAP Methods Data was collected by members of the PRISM trainee research network Patient demographics, comorbidities, Rockwood clinical frailty scale (CFS) and outcomes (death or discharge) were collected for patients requiring CPAP for hypoxaemic respiratory failure with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 across 6 sites in the South West over 11 weeks from March-June 2020 Results Data was collected for 164 patients Ages of patients ranged from 30-88 years (mean 62 13), 110 (61 1%) male Most patients received CPAP on a respiratory ward (79 3%) A treatment escalation plan was recorded for 153 (85%) of patients on admission to hospital Of 100 patients eligible for escalation to intensive care (ICU), 50 required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) despite CPAP therapy CFS scores ranged from 1 to 7 (mean 2 5) Average CFS score those eligible for IMV was 1 75, compared to 3 67 for those who were deemed ineligible for IMV Mortality data are shown in table 1 Average length of stay for survivors was 15 6 days (1-63) The average number of days from admission to death was 8 6 (0-48) Conclusion In our cohort of patients who received CPAP as a ceiling of treatment mortality was high, especially compared to patients eligible for invasive mechanical ventilation We highlight the need for early treatment escalation decisions, informed discussions with patients and relatives and involvement of palliative care where appropriate These data are potentially limited by variation in practice between sites, and further robust evidence is needed to establish patient selection and timing of CPAP","output":"South west experience of continuous positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation for covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The crisis in the health system caused by COVID-19 has left some important humanitarian deficits on how to care for the sick in their last days of life.

We estimated the burden of psychological distress and scrutinized the role that social support may play in moderating psychological distress among conflict refugees in urban, semi-rural and rural settlements in Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : Cross-sectional survey data on psychological distress, social support, demographics, socio-economic and behavioral variables was gathered from 1014 adult refugees randomly sampled from urban, semi-rural and rural refugee settlementsin Uganda, using two-staged cluster sampling. Research instruments were checked for reliability using Cronbachs Alpha. T-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Multivariable Linear Regression were applied to analyse the data in SPSS-version 22. Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05. Results: : Refugees resident in rural/semi-rural settlements exhibited higher levels of psychological distress, lower levels of social interaction and lower levels of social attachment than peers resident in urban settlements. However, they reported, on the other hand, higher adequacy of social interaction and higher adequacy of social attachment than peers resident in urban settlements. Adequacy of social interaction and attachment were directly associated with psychological distress and acted as stress buffers in the relationship between psychological distress and rural/urban settlement. Conclusions: : There is a settlement-inequality (i.e. rural vs. urban) in psychological distress and social support among conflict refugees in Uganda. Both the direct and buffering effects of adequacy of social interaction and attachment can explain the rural/urban discrepancy in psychological distress, with important implications for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) interventions.","output":"Psychological Distress and Social Support among Conflict Refugees in Urban, Semi-rural and Rural Settlements in Uganda: Burden and Mechanisms of Association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease, the rising concerns about the prevalence of alcohol-based hand sanitizers inappropriate use and substandard products in the market create an ongoing safety concern.

SUMMARY ANSWER: We identified six main categories of people; Avoiders, Betweeners, Completers, Desirers, Expectants and Flexers, for whom reproduction education strategies should be tailored differently to suit intentions. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Several studies have highlighted poor fertility awareness across men and women of reproductive age. As the average age of first-time parents continues to rise, there has been a concerted effort from educators, healthcare professionals, charities, reproductive health groups and government policymakers, to improve fertility awareness. In order to ensure that these messages are effective and to deploy the best strategies, it is important to understand peoples reproductive health needs. This study therefore aimed to explore different reproductive intentions to aid tailoring of information to help individuals and couples achieve their family building desires. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We conducted a mixed-method study via a UK-wide cross-sectional survey with 1082 participants and semi-structured interviews of 20 women and 15 men who agreed to follow-up interviews. Interviews lasted an hour on average. Ethics approval from UCL Research Ethics Committee. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Survey participants were recruited nationwide via online newspaper and social media adverts. Interviewees were purposely sampled to include men and women from the reproductive age range (18C45 years), varying ethnicity and education background. Survey data were analysed using the Minitab statistical software package. Interview data were transcribed and analysed using the framework method. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: From the survey and interviews, we identified six key categories of people, grouped alphabetically, in a user-friendly manner to highlight a spectrum of reproductive intentions: Avoiders describes respondents who have no children and do not want to have children in the future; Betweeners describes those who already have child(ren) and want more in the future but are not actively trying to conceive; Completers describes those who have child(ren) but do not want more; Desirers describes those who are actively trying to conceive or plan to have child(ren) in the future; Expectants describes those who were pregnant at the time of the study; and Flexers describes those who may or may not already have and are unsure but or open to having child(ren) in the future. Analysis of survey data identified the following proportions in our study: Avoiders, 4.7%; Betweeners, 11.3%; Completers, 13.6%; Desirers, 36.9%; Expectants, 4.1%; and Flexers 28.4% and 2.4% preferring not to answer. There was one other group from qualitative analysis, who would like to have children in the future but were unsure whether they could or had changing views. We recommend classifying as Desirers or Flexers for the purposes of fertility education. A majority of the survey population were trying to get pregnant; were pregnant; or planning to have a child in the futurewhether actively, passively or simply open to the idea, with interviews providing deep insights into their family building decision-making. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Due to the online recruitment method, there may be a bias towards more educated respondents. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We developed a user-friendly, alphabetical categorization of reproductive intentions, which may be used by individuals, healthcare professionals, educators, special interest groups, charities and policymakers to support and enable individuals and couples in making informed choices to achieve their desired intentions, if and when they choose to start a family.

Discrete-time mathematical models are commonly used for describing the dynamical properties of phytoplankton and zooplankton interaction with nonoverlapping generations.

Keeping in observation the dynamical reliability for continuous-time mathematical models, we convert a continuous-time phytoplanktonCzooplankton model into its discrete-time counterpart by applying a dynamically consistent nonstandard difference scheme. Moreover, we discuss boundedness conditions for every solution and prove the existence of a unique positive equilibrium point. We discuss the local stability of obtained system about all its equilibrium points and show the existence of NeimarkCSacker bifurcation about unique positive equilibrium under some mathematical conditions. To control the NeimarkCSacker bifurcation, we apply a generalized hybrid control technique. For explanation of our theoretical results and to compare the dynamics of obtained discrete-time model with its continuous counterpart, we provide some motivating numerical examples. Moreover, from numerical study we can see that the obtained system and its continuous-time counterpart are stable for the same values of parameters, and they are unstable for the same parametric values. Hence the dynamical consistency of our obtained system can be seen from numerical study.

However, there remain no licensed vaccines or specific treatments for hMPV infection. Although the hMPV fusion (F) protein is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies, the immunological properties of hMPV F remain poorly understood. To further define the humoral immune response to the hMPV F protein, we isolated two new human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), MPV458 and MPV465. Both mAbs are neutralizing in vitro and were determined to target a unique antigenic site using competitive biolayer interferometry. We determined both MPV458 and MPV465 have higher affinity for monomeric hMPV F than trimeric hMPV F. MPV458 was co-crystallized with hMPV F, and the mAb primarily interacts with an alpha helix on the F2 region of the hMPV F protein. Surprisingly, the major epitope for MPV458 lies within the trimeric interface of the hMPV F protein, suggesting significant breathing of the hMPV F protein must occur for host immune recognition of the novel epitope. In addition, significant glycan interactions were observed with a somatically mutated light chain framework residue.

Data were collected through a cross-sectional questionnaire from 357 Pakistani business-educated adults, including investors who had a rudimentary understanding of the technology and financial instruments. Partial least square (PLS)-based structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the developed theoretical framework based on the Technology acceptance model 3. The PLS model has explained 72.1% of what constitutes the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency. Surprisingly, risk was not a major consideration. This might be due to the fact that the majority of respondents thought working with cryptocurrency was hazardous. Willingness to handle cryptocurrency risk, on the other hand, might be a stumbling block to acceptance. The most essential aspect of a cryptocurrency's success was the perceived usefulness. Moreover, the moderating role of experience was not substantiated in this study. However, perceived usefulness was identified as a partial mediator of subjective norm and the perceived ease to use. This study contributed to the literature through the application of TAM 3 (an extension of the technology acceptance models) to investigate the fundamental qualities a cryptocurrency should have in order to influence investor's behavioural intention to use it. These findings provide revolutionary insights for the present and future market players for investment planning and for improved cryptocurrencies development.","output":"Factors Influencing the Behavioural Intention to Use Cryptocurrency in Emerging Economies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Based on Technology Acceptance Model 3, Perceived Risk, and Financial Literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The terms basic, superordinate, subordinate, and global are often used to describe the categories formed by infants. However, although infants' categories appear externally to match those formed by adults, it is not clear that they are grounded in an organized hierarchical system that embodies relations within and between domains; that is, a taxonomy. To assess whether it is appropriate to consider infants' categories as taxonomies, 3 criteria are examined: (a) similarity to adults' choice of category members, (b) hierarchical understanding, and (c) agreement with adults' bases for classification. It is argued that infants' categories do not meet these criteria and that it may be erroneous to apply the same labels to categories formed in the first 2 years as those in later life. To do so may be to hold an illusion of taxonomies about infants' categories.","output":"When a Rose Is Just a Rose: The Illusion of Taxonomies in Infant Categorization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES While current antiretroviral and care strategies can effectively suppress HIV, achieving optimal quality of life (QoL) requires a wider consideration of clients' well-being, the complexity of individuals' lives and social determinants of health. The objective of this commentary was to develop a definition of client-led care in the Australian context and its key supporting principles for people living with HIV (PLHIV). METHODS The authors used two sources of evidence to support their HIV community experience with client-led care: (1) a scoping review of the literature, and (2) consultations with colleagues who were PLHIV advocates or HIV specialist physicians. The findings from the scoping review and consultations were summarised and the key principles of client-led care compared with those identified by the authors. RESULTS Seven articles met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis in the scoping review. Five PLHIV advocates and three HIV specialist physicians were consulted. Key principles supporting client-led care identified by the authors based on their experience centred around the themes of: (1) clients and healthcare providers working in partnership, (2) information and communication, (3) coordinating access to care, (4) building trust, and (5) respect for client's needs and preferences. The principles identified by the authors were supported by those of the scoping review and colleague consultations.

There remains sparse transparent reporting of model generalizability in different subpopulations especially for implemented systems. METHODS A prognostic study included adult admissions at a multi-site, academic medical center between 2015 and 2017. A predictive model for all-cause mortality (including initiation of hospice care) within 60 days of admission was developed. Model generalizability is assessed in temporal validation in the context of potential demographic bias. A subsequent prospective cohort study was conducted at the same sites between October 2018 and June 2019. Model performance during prospective validation was quantified with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves stratified by site. Prospective results include timeliness, positive predictive value, and the number of actionable predictions. RESULTS Three years of development data included 128,941 inpatient admissions (94,733 unique patients) across sites where patients are mostly white (61%) and female (60%) and 4.2% led to death within 60 days. A random forest model incorporating 9614 predictors produced areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves of 87.2 (95% CI, 86.1-88.2) and 28.0 (95% CI, 25.0-31.0) in temporal validation. Performance marginally diverges within sites as the patient mix shifts from development to validation (patients of one site increases from 10 to 38%). Applied prospectively for nine months, 41,728 predictions were generated in real-time (median [IQR], 1.3 [0.9, 32] minutes). An operating criterion of 75% positive predictive value identified 104 predictions at very high risk (0.25%) where 65% (50 from 77 well-timed predictions) led to death within 60 days. CONCLUSION Temporal validation demonstrates good model discrimination for 60-day mortality. Slight performance variations are observed across demographic subpopulations.

Anesthesiologists in particular are considered at risk, since aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation and extubation, have been shown to significantly increase the odds for respiratory infections during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks. This study assessed the incidence of COVID-19-like symptoms and presence of COVID-19 antibodies after work-related COVID-19 exposures, among physicians working in a large academic hospital in New York City (NYC). METHODS: An e-mail survey was addressed to anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center on April 15, 2020. The survey assessed 4 domains: 1) demographics and medical history, 2) community exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., use of NYC subway), 3) work-related exposure to COVID-19, and 4) development of COVID-19-like symptoms after work exposure. The first 100 survey responders were invited to undergo a blood test to assess antibody status (presence of IgM/IgG specific to COVID-19). Work-related exposure was defined as any episode where the provider was not wearing adequate personal protective equipment (airborne or droplet/contact protection depending on the exposure type). Based on the clinical scenario, work exposure was categorized as high-risk (e.g., exposure during intubation) or low-risk (e.g., exposure during doffing). RESULTS: 205 healthcare providers were contacted and 105 completed the survey (51%); 91 completed the serological test. Sixty-one of the respondents (58%) reported at least one work-related exposure and 54% of the exposures were high-risk. Among respondents reporting a work-related exposure, 16 (26.2%) reported post-exposure COVID-19-like symptoms. The most frequent symptoms were myalgia (9 cases), diarrhea (8 cases), fever (7 cases), and sore throat (7 cases). COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 11 of the 91 tested respondents (12.1%), with no difference between respondents with (11.8%) or without (12.5%) a work- related exposure, including high-risk exposure. Compared with antibody negative respondents, antibody positive respondents were more likely to use NYC subway to commute to work and report COVID-19-like symptoms in the last 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: In the epicenter of the United States' pandemic and within 6-8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, a small proportion of anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers reported COVID-19-like symptoms after a work-related exposure and even fewer had detectable COVID-19 antibodies. Presence of COVID-19 antibodies appeared to be associated with community/environmental transmission rather than secondary to work-related exposures involving high risk procedures.","output":"Anesthesiologists' and intensive care providers' exposure to COVID-19 infection in a New York City academic center: a prospective cohort study assessing symptoms and COVID-19 antibody testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The topic of SDG interactions is a relatively new research area with many knowledge gaps. Some of these gaps are addressed in this summary of a Special Feature of Sustainability Science, including new findings and emerging issues on (1) the characteristics of SDG interactions; (2) methods/methodology to analyse these interactions; and (3) the elaboration of drivers that influence SDG synergies. The importance of scale is clear in two emerging issues. First, there is evidence of a disconnect between national planning for SDGs and their implementation at the local scale which is leading to SDG trade-offs between these scales. Second, the concept of a critical transition zone is introduced where SDG trade-offs pose a particular challenge to SDG implementation. These are areas (e.g., peri-urban and forest margin areas in the Global South) undergoing rapid biophysical and/or socio-economic changes and inhabited by populations especially vulnerable to these changes. While trade-offs occur among the SDGs, there are also many examples of synergies which provide opportunities for advancing multiple goals. To distinguish between synergies and the actions that exploit them, the term synergy driver is introduced to refer to policies and measures that positively advance two or more goals. Several examples of synergy drivers are presented, including sustainable global supply chains, people-centred early warning systems, and joint conservation-public health programmes. To make synergy drivers relevant to the broader policy community, the research community (working with stakeholders) should first consolidate knowledge about these drivers and then evaluate their effectiveness/applicability to different policy settings.","output":"Analysing interactions among the sustainable development goals: findings and emerging issues from local and global studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adapting dashboard design to different contexts of use is an open question in visualisation research. Dashboard designers often seek to strike a balance between dashboard adaptability and ease-of-use, and in hospitals challenges arise from the vast diversity of key metrics, data models and users involved at different organizational levels.

We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare professionals, a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI, using this concept as a building block for generating highly adaptable dashboards, and leading to the design of a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a metric card, while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of QualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS hospitals.

Before the pandemic, corporate net lending activities had been increasing for decades due to various factors ranging from the rise in uncertainty after the global financial crisis to the increased reliance on internal funding for research and development expenditures. In Germany, the rise in corporate saving was accompanied by an increase in equity capital and a reduction in the corporate sectors reliance on bank loans. This article argues that the coronavirus crisis is most likely to interrupt the trend in corporate saving in the short run due to the decline in companies revenues. Nonetheless, similar to the pattern observed in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it seems reasonable to conjecture that the COVID-19 shock will strengthen corporate saving in the long run as companies may attempt to restore their liquidity and equity capital buffers to better prepare for future shocks. This will in turn create downward pressure on real interest rates and complicate the conduct of monetary policy.","output":"Why the COVID-19 Pandemic Could Increase the Corporate Saving Trend in the Long Run"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To predict the effects of the 2020 U.S. CARES Act on consumption, we extend a model that matches responses to past consumption stimulus packages.

Second, some of the jobs that disappear during the lockdown will not reappear. We estimate that, if the lockdown is short-lived (the median point of view as we are writing in April 2020), the combination of expanded unemployment insurance benefits and stimulus payments should be sufficient to allow a swift recovery in consumer spending to pre-crisis levels.

Methods: In this prospective study, 120 paired NPS and OPS specimens were collected from 120 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in swabs were detected by real-time RT-PCR. The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate, sensitivity, and viral load were analyzed with regards NPS and OPS. Sampling discomfort reported by patients was evaluated. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate was significantly higher for NPS [46.7% (56/120)] than OPS [10.0% (12/120)] (P &lt; 0.001). The sensitivity of NPS was also significantly higher than that of OPS (P &lt; 0.001). At the time of sampling, the time of detectable SARS-CoV-2 had a longer median duration (25.0 vs. 20.5 days, respectively) and a longer maximum duration (41 vs. 39 days, respectively) in NPS than OPS.

We report the findings of the first round of a national serosurvey, conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult population of India. METHODS: From May 11 to June 4, 2020, a randomly sampled, community-based survey was conducted in 700 villages/wards, selected from the 70 districts of the 21 States of India, categorized into four strata based on the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases. Four hundred adults per district were enrolled from 10 clusters with one adult per household. Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies using COVID Kavach ELISA kit. All positive serum samples were re-tested using Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Adjusting for survey design and serial test performance, weighted seroprevalence, number of infections, infection to case ratio (ICR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with IgG positivity. RESULTS: Total of 30,283 households were visited and 28,000 individuals were enrolled. Population-weighted seroprevalence after adjusting for test performance was 0.73 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-1.13]. Males, living in urban slums and occupation with high risk of exposure to potentially infected persons were associated with seropositivity. A cumulative 6,468,388 adult infections (95% CI: 3,829,029-11,199,423) were estimated in India by the early May. The overall ICR was between 81.6 (95% CI: 48.3-141.4) and 130.1 (95% CI: 77.0-225.2) with May 11 and May 3, 2020 as plausible reference points for reported cases.

The symptoms of Covid-19 are usually mild and non-specific, however in some cases patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic inflammation. Individuals with inflammatory or immunocompromising illnesses, such as cancer, are more susceptible to develop ARDS and have higher rates of mortality. This is mediated through an initial hyperstimulated immune response which results in elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a subsequent cytokine storm. This potentiates positive feedback loops which are unable to be balanced by anti-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, elevated levels of IL-1, as a result of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as well as IL-6 and TNF- amongst many others, contribute to the progression of various cancer types. Furthermore, Covid-19 progression is associated with the depletion of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells, B cell and natural killer cell numbers.

Methods There are two steps to the developed method: First, association rule mining algorithms are employed to find medicine association rules. The second step entails graph mining and clustering to present an enriched recommendation via ATC code, which itself comprises several steps. First, the initial graph is constructed from historical prescription data. Then, data pruning is performed in the second step, after which the medicines with a high repetition rate are removed at the discretion of a general medical practitioner. Next, the medicines are matched to a well-known medicine classification system called the ATC code to provide an enriched recommendation.

A greater number of social support (three or more) was linked to a lower score of depression (p = 0.005) and stress (p = 0.045). Undergraduates who received family support demonstrated lower depression scores (p = 0.037) and higher mental wellbeing (p = 0.020) compared to those without. Government support was independently associated with a lesser risk of depressive symptoms (Adjusted odds ratio, AOR 0.68; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.47C0.99) and a greater sense of mental wellbeing (AOR 1.54; 95% CI 1.06C2.22). The present finding provides evidence of a high prevalence of psychological distress among clinical undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate social support is important in alleviating anxiety and stress and promoting greater mental wellbeing amongst students during the nationwide quarantine.","output":"The Psychological Impact of Movement Restriction during the COVID-19 Outbreak on Clinical Undergraduates: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Abstract: Epidemiology models used in macroeconomics generally assume that people know their current health status In this paper, we consider a more realistic environment in which people are uncertain about their health status We use our model to study the impact of testing with and without quarantining infected people We find that testing without quarantines can worsen the economic and health repercussions of an epidemic In contrast, a policy that uses tests to quarantine infected people has very large social benefits Critically, this policy ameliorates the sharp tradeoff between declines in economic activity and health outcomes that is associated with broad-based containment policies like lockdowns This amelioration is particularly dramatic when people who recover from an infection acquire only temporary immunity to the virus COVID-19 (Disease);Macroeconomics;Health--Testing;Quarantine","output":"Macroeconomics of Testing and Quarantining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has been a significant health crisis and has the possibility for further crises. The pandemic has also brought many challenges to food security issues in Indonesia. The country indeed has a long history of food security, and rice, as the staple food, has become the main focus of food security policies. As a country known for its agriculture, Indonesia is still struggling to reach food self-sufficiency due to some classic problems in agriculture such as agricultural land-use change, human resources, inputs, etc. Considering that local production cannot meet the national food demand, food imports were arranged. Nevertheless, this policy is not suitable for an extended period due to the risks of food import dependency. Speaking of food security challenges in the post-Covid-19 pandemic, Indonesia's high focus on rice, classic problems in agriculture, supportive regulation, and education are regarded as the main concerns. Beyond these challenges, however, food security opportunities also appeared, such as increasing awareness of food waste, strong social capital, and return to local potential to support the food security agenda. The pandemic has made many parties realize that food security issues are important and need more attention, especially in terms of how the four main aspects of food security can be met during and after the crisis.","output":"Food security challenges and opportunities in indonesia post COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/AIMS Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative illness with great unmet patient need. We aimed to evaluate whether mesenchymal stem cells induced to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF), a novel autologous cell-therapy capable of targeting multiple pathways, could safely slow ALS disease progression. METHODS This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled ALS participants meeting revised El Escorial criteria, revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) 25 (screening) and 3 ALSFRS-R points decline prior to randomization. Participants received three treatments of MSC-NTF or placebo intrathecally. The primary endpoint evaluated efficacy of MSC-NTF through a responder analysis and safety. A change in disease progression post-treatment of 1.25 points/month defines a clinical response. A pre-specified analysis leveraged baseline ALSFRS-R of 35 as a subgroup threshold. RESULTS Overall, MSC-NTF treatment was well tolerated; there were no safety concerns. Thirty-three percent of MSC-NTF and 28% of placebo participants met clinical response criteria at 28 weeks (OR=1.33, p=0.45), thus the primary endpoint was not met. A pre-specified analysis of participants with baseline ALSFRS-R35 (n=58) showed a clinical response rate at 28 weeks of 35% MSC-NTF and 16% placebo (OR=2.6, p=0.29). Significant improvements in CSF biomarkers of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and neurotrophic factor support were observed with MSC-NTF, with placebo unchanged. DISCUSSION The study did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. However, a pre-specified subgroup suggests that MSC-NTF participants with less severe disease may have retained more function compared to Placebo.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Two hundred and eight patients who were operated on between October 2010 and October 2011 were included. Of the patients, 65 underwent right-LDN and 143 underwent left-LDN. The groups were compared in terms of duration of surgery, warm ischemia time, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and donor outcomes. RESULTS The mean duration of surgery was 14419.7 min and 147.820.2 min in the right- and left-LDN groups, respectively. The mean warm ischemia times were 139.154.1 s and 141.537.9 in the right- and left-LDN groups, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.41.0 days for both groups. No major complications were observed in the groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of donor outcomes.

However, the thermal instability and pre-existing immunity have limited its wide applications. To circumvent these obstacles, we constructed a self-biomineralized adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine (Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP) by generating a calcium phosphate mineral exterior (CaP) based on Sad23L vector carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) under physiological condition. This Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP vaccine was examined for its characteristics of structure, thermostability, immunogenicity and avoiding the problem of preexisting immunity. In thermostability test, Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP could be stored at 4 C for over 45 days, 26 C for more than 8 days and 37 C for approximately 2 days. Furthermore, Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP induced higher level of S-specific antibody and T cell responses, and was not affected by the pre-existing anti-Sad23L immunity, suggesting it could be used as boosting immunization on Sad23L-nCoV-S priming vaccination. The boosting with Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP vaccine induced high titers of 10(5.01) anti-S1, 10(4.77) anti-S2 binding antibody, 10(3.04) pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (IC(50)), and robust T-cell response of IFN- (1466.16 SFCs/10(6) cells) to S peptides, respectively. In summary, the self-biomineralization of the COVID-19 vaccine Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP improved vaccine efficacy, which could be used in prime-boost regimen for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

Five weeks after single AAV administration and four weeks after UNx, female db/db UNx-ReninAAV mice received (PO, QD) vehicle, lisinopril (40 mg/kg), empagliflozin (20 mg/kg) or combination treatment for 12 weeks (n=17 per group). Untreated db/+ mice (n=8) and vehicle-dosed db/db UNx-LacZAAV mice (n=17) served as controls. Endpoints included plasma, urine and histomorphometric markers of kidney disease. Total glomerular numbers and individual glomerular volume was evaluated by whole-kidney 3D imaging analysis. db/db UNx-ReninAAV mice developed hallmarks of progressive DKD characterized by severe albuminuria, advanced glomerulosclerosis and glomerular hypertrophy. Lisinopril significantly improved albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury and inflammation.

Immune regulation plays a key role in anti-tumour therapy. The present study explored the anti-tumour effect of ESPs released by Angiostrongylus cantonensis. In Hepa1-6 mouse tumour models, ESPs significantly reduced tumour growth. Tumour-bearing mice treated with ESPs had significantly higher CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts than those treated with Freund's adjuvant. In vitro, human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells, human lung cancer A549 cells, and normal human liver HL-7702 cells were co-incubated with ESPs for 24 h and 48 h. ESPs significantly accelerated HepG2 apoptosis but had no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of A549 and HL-7702 cells. Apoptotic HepG2 cells displayed condensed nuclei, apoptotic bodies, and swollen endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related factors activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in HepG2 cells increased with increasing ESP concentration and treatment time. Calreticulin (CRT) is a key effector protein of ESPs, and recombinant calreticulin (rCRT) was produced in BL21 Escherichia coli (E. coli). In contrast to ESPs, rCRT markedly reduced the proliferation of HepG2 cells. The expression levels of ATF6 and CHOP in HepG2 cells treated with 30 g/mL rCRT significantly increased at 48 h.

In Europe, this is of particular relevance with ageing populations living with non-communicable diseases, multi-morbidity and frailty. Published estimates of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study help to characterise the extent of these effects. Our aim was to identify the countries across Europe that have populations at highest risk from COVID-19 by using estimates of population age structure and YLD for health conditions linked to severe illness from COVID-19. Methods: Population and YLD estimates from GBD 2017 were extracted for 45 countries in Europe. YLD was restricted to a list of specific health conditions associated with being at risk of developing severe consequences from COVID-19 based on guidance from the United Kingdom Government. This guidance also identified individuals aged 70 years and above as being at higher risk of developing severe health consequences. Study outcomes were defined as: (i) proportion of population aged 70 years and above; and (ii) rate of YLD for COVID-19 for vulnerable health conditions across all ages. Bivariate groupings were established for each outcome and combined to establish overall population-level vulnerability. Results: Countries with the highest proportions of elderly residents were Italy, Greece, Germany, Portugal and Finland. When assessments of population-level YLD rates for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions were made the highest rates were observed for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina. A bivariate analysis indicated that the countries at high-risk across both measures of vulnerability were: Bulgaria; Portugal; Latvia; Lithuania; Greece; Germany; Estonia; and Sweden. Conclusion: Routine estimates of population structures and non-fatal burden of disease measures can be usefully combined to create composite indicators of vulnerability for rapid assessments, in this case to severe health consequences from COVID-19.

We highlight and address some common genome sequence analysis pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate inference of mutation rates and selection, such as ignoring skews in the genetic code, not accounting for recurrent mutations, and assuming evolutionary equilibrium. We find that two particular mutation rates, G aU and C aU, are similarly elevated and considerably higher than all other mutation rates, causing the majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and are possibly the result of APOBEC and ROS activity. These mutations also tend to occur many times at the same genome positions along the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (i.e., they are very homoplasic).

High patient volume is known to increase the boarding time at the emergency department (ED), as well as at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Furthermore, the same high volume increases inpatient bed transfer times, which causes delays in elective surgeries, increases the probability of near misses, patient safety incidents, and adverse events. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to develop a Machine Learning (ML) based strategy to predict weekly forecasts of the inpatient bed demand in order to assist the resource planning for the ED and PACU, resulting in a more efficient utilization. METHODS: The data utilized included all adult inpatient encounters at Geisinger Medical Center (GMC) for the last 5 years. The variables considered were class of inpatient encounter, observation, or surgical overnight recovery (SORU) at the time of their discharge. The ML based strategy is built using the K-means clustering method and the Support Vector Machine Regression technique (K-SVR). RESULTS: The performance obtained by the K-SVR strategy in the retrospective cohort amounts to a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) that ranges between 0.49 and 4.10% based on the test period. Additionally, results present a reduced variability, which translates into more stable forecasting results.

Understanding the dynamics of the spread of information and its co-option by interested parties is of critical importance. Research on this topic has shown that individuals tend to cluster in echo-chambers and are driven by confirmation bias. In this paper, we leverage the active inference framework to provide an in silico model of confirmation bias and its effect on echo-chamber formation. We build a model based on active inference, where agents tend to sample information in order to justify their own view of reality, which eventually leads to them to have a high degree of certainty about their own beliefs. We show that, once agents have reached a certain level of certainty about their beliefs, it becomes very difficult to get them to change their views. This system of self-confirming beliefs is upheld and reinforced by the evolving relationship between an agents beliefs and observations, which over time will continue to provide evidence for their ingrained ideas about the world. The epistemic communities that are consolidated by these shared beliefs, in turn, tend to produce perceptions of reality that reinforce those shared beliefs. We provide an active inference account of this community formation mechanism. We postulate that agents are driven by the epistemic value that they obtain from sampling or observing the behaviours of other agents. Inspired by digital social networks like Twitter, we build a generative model in which agents generate observable social claims or posts (e.g., tweets) while reading the socially observable claims of other agents that lend support to one of two mutually exclusive abstract topics. Agents can choose which other agent they pay attention to at each timestep, and crucially who they attend to and what they choose to read influences their beliefs about the world. Agents also assess their local networks perspective, influencing which kinds of posts they expect to see other agents making. The model was built and simulated using the freely available Python package pymdp. The proposed active inference model can reproduce the formation of echo-chambers over social networks, and gives us insight into the cognitive processes that lead to this phenomenon.","output":"Epistemic Communities under Active Inference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening stations set up by Iranian Red Crescent Society have been available for 17 d with the aim of identifying and treating people with coronavirus, reducing road trips, and sensitizing people to the problem.

Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. PATIENTS AND METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n=276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n=152). RESULTS: The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (P<.0001), depression (P&#8804;.05), anxiety (P&#8804;.05), phobic anxiety (P<.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (P&#8804;.043), and psychoticism (P&#8804;.023).

METHODS: A multilevel robust computational analysis was undertaken for viral genetic sequence alignment, phylogram construction, genome-wide transcriptome data interpretation of virus-infected lung tissues, miRNA mapping, and functional biology networking. RESULTS: Our findings show both genetic similarities as well as notable differences in the S protein length among SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS viruses. All SARS-CoV-2 strains showed a high genetic similarity with the parent Wuhan strain, but Saudi Arabian, South African, USA, Russia and New Zealand strains carry 3 additional genetic variations like P333L (RNA -dependant RNA polymerase), D614G (spike), and P4715L (ORF1ab).

Epidemiological data and observational reports from both the original SARS epidemic and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic have a common feature: males are more likely to exhibit enhanced disease severity and mortality than females. Sex differences in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 share mechanistic foundations, namely the involvement of both the innate immune system and the canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Immunological differences suggest that females mount a rapid and aggressive innate immune response, and the attenuated antiviral response in males may confer enhanced susceptibility to severe disease. Further, the ACE2 enzyme is involved in disease pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, either to serve as a protective mechanism by deactivating the renin-angiotensin system or as the receptor for viral entry, respectively. Loss of membrane ACE2 and a corresponding increase in plasma ACE2 are associated with worsened cardiovascular disease outcomes, a mechanism attributed to A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM)17. SARS-CoV-2 infection also leads to ADAM17 activation, a positive feedback cycle that exacerbates ACE2 loss. Therefore, the relationship between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 is critically dependent on the loss of membrane ACE2 by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage.

The second stage is the development period of prevention and control, the virus transmission shows a fluctuating state. In the third stage, which is in the mature stage of prevention and control, the virus spreads as a linear function. At the same time, the data curve of three stages and the reasons for its formation are analyzed. The laws revealed by this model have a certain theoretical basis for the prevention and control of new infectious diseases such as coronary pneumonia, which will have a certain guiding effect on the prevention and control of viruses in newly discovered countries and regions of the epidemic.","output":"COVID-19 Epidemic Prediction Model and Prevention and Control Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE A relevant proportion of patients with acute ischemic stroke are ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are still unclear. The Euro-COVIMID study aimed to determine the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as factors associated with COVID-19 occurrence and the impact of the pandemic in its management. Methods: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj?gren's syndrome, or giant cell arteritis were recruited from six tertiary referral centres in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. Demographics, comorbidities, treatments, and recent disease flares, as well as information on COVID-19 symptoms, were collected through a questionnaire completed by participants. SARS-CoV-2 serology was systematically tested. The main outcome was the serological and clinical prevalence of COVID-19. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were assessed by multivariable logistic regression, and incidence of recent disease flares, changes in treatments for underlying disease, and the reasons for treatment changes were also assessed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04397237. Findings: Between June 7 and Dec 8, 2020, 3136 patients with an immune-mediated inflammatory disease answered the questionnaire. 3028 patients (median age 58 years [IQR 46-67]; 2239 [739%] women and 789 [261%] men) with symptomatic COVID-19, serological data, or both were included in analyses. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 166 (55% [95% CI 47-64]) of 3018 patients who had serology tests. Symptomatic COVID-19 occurred in 122 (40% [95% CI 34-48]) of 3028 patients, of whom 24 (197%) were admitted to hospital and four (33%) died. Factors associated with symptomatic COVID-19 were higher concentrations of C-reactive protein (odds ratio 118, 95% CI 105-133; p=00063), and higher numbers of recent disease flares (127, 102-158; p=0030), whereas use of biological therapy was associated with reduced risk (051, 032-082; p=00057). At least one disease flare occurred in 654 (216%) of 3028 patients. Over the study period, 519 (206%) of 2514 patients had treatment changes, of which 125 (241%) were due to the pandemic. Interpretation: This study provides key insights into the epidemiology and risk factors of COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Overall, immunosuppressants do not seem to be deleterious in this scenario, and the control of inflammatory activity seems to be key when facing the pandemic.

Here, we investigated the effect of ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker glibenclamide on levcromakalim-induced headache in healthy volunteers. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study, 15 healthy volunteers aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to receive glibenclamide and levcromakalim (day 1), glibenclamide and placebo (day 2), and placebo and placebo (day 3) on three different days separated by at least 1 week. The primary endpoints were the difference in incidence of headache and the difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores (0-12 hours) between the days. RESULTS Fifteen healthy volunteers completed the 3 days of the study. More participants (12/15, 80%) developed headache on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (5/15, 33%) (p = 0.01; mean difference 47%; 95% confidence interval 18-75%) and compared to the placebo-placebo day (1/15, 7%) (p = 0.001; mean difference 73%; 95% confidence interval 48-99%). We found no difference in headache incidence between glibenclamide-placebo day and placebo-placebo day (p = 0.12; mean difference 27%; 95% confidence interval 1.3-52%). The area under the curve for headache intensity was significantly larger on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (p = 0.003); and compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.001). We found no difference in the area under the curve between the glibenclamide-placebo day compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.07). The median time to onset for headache after levcromakalim infusion with glibenclamide pretreatment was delayed (180 min) compared to levcromakalim without pretreatment (30 min) from a previously published study. CONCLUSION Glibenclamide administration did not cause headache, and glibenclamide pretreatment did not prevent levcromakalim-induced headache.

In this study, we determined whether symptomatic respiratory viral infections after lung transplantation induce circulating exosomes that contain lung-associated self-antigens and assessed whether these exosomes activate immune responses to self-antigens. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from lung transplant recipients with symptomatic lower- and upper-tract respiratory viral infections and from non-symptomatic stable recipients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation; purity was determined using sucrose cushion; and presence of lung self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens for rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were determined using immunoblot. Mice were immunized with circulating exosomes from each group and resulting differential immune responses and lung histology were analyzed. RESULTS: Exosomes containing self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens were detected at significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) in serum of recipients with symptomatic respiratory viral infections (n = 35) as compared with stable controls (n = 32). Mice immunized with exosomes from recipients with respiratory viral infections developed immune responses to self-antigens, fibrosis, small airway occlusion, and significant cellular infiltration; mice immunized with exosomes from controls did not (p < 0.05).

The objective of our study was to determine whether pregnant women with schizophrenia were at increased risk of pregnancy, delivery and neonatal complications compared with women without severe mental disorders. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study of all singleton deliveries in France between Jan. 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2019. We divided this population into cases (i.e., women with schizophrenia) and controls (i.e., women without a diagnosis of severe mental disorder). Cases and controls were matched (1:4) inside the same hospital and the same year by age, social deprivation, parity, smoking, alcohol and substance addictions, malnutrition, obesity, and comorbidities. Univariate and multivariate models with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (ORs [95% CIs]) were used to estimate the association between schizophrenia and 24 pregnancy, delivery and neonatal outcomes. FINDINGS: Over 5 years, 3,667,461 singleton deliveries were identified, of which 3,108 occurred in women with schizophrenia. Compared to controls, women with schizophrenia were found to be older; have more frequent smoking, alcohol and substance addictions; suffer from obesity, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and often be hospitalized in tertiary maternity hospitals. Compared to matched controls, women with schizophrenia had more pregnancy complications (adjusted OR=1.41[95%CI 1.31-1.51]) (i.e., gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, genito-urinary infection, intrauterine growth retardation and threatened preterm labour). They had more delivery complications (aOR=1.18[95%CI 1.09 1.29]) with more still births/medical abortions (aOR=2.17[95%CI 1.62-2.90]) and caesarean sections (aOR=1.15[95%CI 1.05-1.25]). Newborns of women with schizophrenia had more neonatal complications (aOR=1.38[95%CI 1.27-1.50]) with more born preterm (aOR=1.64[95%CI1.42 -1.90]), small for gestational age (aOR=1.34[95%CI 1.19-1.50]) and low birth weight (aOR=1.75[95%CI 1.53-2.00]).

One of the central challenges facing investigators involves the fair selection of research subjects to participate in CHI studies. While there is widespread agreement that investigators have a duty to select research participants fairly, this principle also yields conflicting ethical imperatives, for example requiring investigators to both exclude potential participants with co-morbidities since they face increased risks, but also to include them in order to ensure generalizability.

Unexpected complications in these patients are increasingly being recognized. We performed liver transplantation on a 51-year-old gentleman with decompensated liver disease 23 days after recovering from a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, despite massive blood loss and a prolonged anhepatic phase, his thromboelastographic (TEG) parameters persistently revealed hypercoagulability. After a brief uneventful early post-operative period, he developed hepatic arterial thrombosis on the 14th post-operative day, and again after 4 days, both of which required surgical intervention. Following discharge, the artery was thrombosed again which was only picked up when he developed a cholangiolar abscess, leading to graft loss necessitating re-transplantation. There is a lot of evidence suggesting that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to be hypercoagulable. We believe that this hypercoagulability might have played a significant role in the development of hepatic arterial thrombosis and eventual graft loss in this patient.

While molecular detection tools enable identification of respiratory viruses in wheezing children, it remains unclear if and how these viruses are associated with wheezing. The objective of this systematic review is to clarify the prevalence of different respiratory viruses in children with wheezing. METHODS: We performed an electronic in Pubmed and Global Index Medicus on 01 July 2019 and manual search. We performed search of studies that have detected common respiratory viruses in children &#8804;18 years with wheezing. We included only studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Study data were extracted and the quality of articles assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroup, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effects model. RESULTS: The systematic review included 33 studies. Rhinovirus, with a prevalence of 35.6% (95% CI 24.6-47.3, I2 98.4%), and respiratory syncytial virus, at 31.0% (95% CI 19.9-43.3, I2 96.4%), were the most common viruses detected. The prevalence of other respiratory viruses was as follows: human bocavirus 8.1% (95% CI 5.3-11.3, I2 84.6%), human adenovirus 7.7% (95% CI 2.6-15.0, I2 91.0%), influenza virus6.5% (95% CI 2.2-12.6, I2 92.4%), human metapneumovirus5.8% (95% CI 3.4-8.8, I2 89.0%), enterovirus 4.3% (95% CI 0.1-12.9, I2 96.2%), human parainfluenza virus 3.8% (95% CI 1.5-6.9, I2 79.1%), and human coronavirus 2.2% (95% CI 0.6-4.4, I2 79.4%).

This study assesses utilisation of the endocarditis team (ET) in limiting routine echocardiography, especially transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), in patients with suspected IE, and explores the effect on clinical outcomes. METHODS: All patients discussed at the ET meeting at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust during the first lockdown in the UK (23 March to 8 July 2020) were prospectively included and analysed in this observational study. RESULTS: In total, 38 patients were referred for ET review (71% male, median age 54 [interquartile range 48, 65.5] years). At the time of ET discussion, 21% had no echo imaging, 16% had point-of-care ultrasound only, and 63% had formal TTE. In total, only 16% underwent TOE. The ability of echocardiography, in those where it was performed, to affect IE diagnosis according to the Modified Duke Criteria was significant (p=0.0099); however, sensitivity was not affected. All-cause mortality was 17% at 30 days and 25% at 12 months from ET discussion in those with confirmed IE. CONCLUSION: Limiting echocardiography in patients with a low pretest probability (not probable or definite IE according to the Modified Duke Criteria) did not affect the diagnostic ability of the Modified Duke Criteria to rule out IE in this small study. Moreover, restricting nonessential echocardiography, and importantly TOE, in patients with suspected IE through use of the ET did not impact all-cause mortality.","output":"Restricted Use of Echocardiography in Suspected Endocarditis during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Multidisciplinary Team Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Accurately forecasting the occurrence of future covid-19-related cases across relaxed (Sweden) and stringent (USA and Canada) policy contexts has a renewed sense of urgency Moreover, there is a need for a multidimensional county-level approach to monitor the second wave of covid-19 in the USA Method: We use an artificial intelligence framework based on timeline of policy interventions that triangulated results based on the three approaches-Bayesian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), Kalman filter, and machine learning","output":"Risk of a second wave of COVID-19 infections: using artificial intelligence to investigate stringency of physical distancing policies in North America.

In such a situation, policies tend to be more extreme than otherwise. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as the background, and in particular the decision to enter into a lockdown of varying degrees, this paper examines the use of heuristics by leaders during the crisis. Combining a case study approach with an empirical exercise, I show that institutional mechanisms were important for determining the response to the coronavirus as the pandemic began.

As the early-stage and entry-level product of the voice-enabled smart home industry, the smart speakers have been going through rapid development and rising fierce market competition globally in recent years. China, one of the most populous and largest markets in the world, has tremendous business potential in the smart home industry. The market sales of smart speakers in China have gone through rapid growth in the past three years. However, the market penetration rate of related smart home devices and equipment still stays extremely low and far from mass adoption. Moreover, the market sales of smart speakers have also entered a significant slowdown and adjustment period since 2020. Chinese consumers have moved from early impulsive consumption to a rational consumption phase about this early-stage smart home product. Trust in the marketing field is considered an indispensable component of all business transactions, which plays a crucial role in adopting new technologies. This study explores the influencing factors of Chinese users' perceived trust in the voice-enabled smart home systems, uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the interaction mechanism between different variables, and establishes a perceived trust model through 475 valid samples. The model includes six variables: system quality, familiarity, subjective norm, technology optimism, perceived enjoyment, and perceived trust. The result shows that system quality is the essential influence factor that impacts all other variables and could significantly affect the perceived trust. Perceived enjoyment is the most direct influence variable affected by system quality, subjective norm, and technology optimism, and it positively affects the perceived trust in the end. The subjective norm is one of the most distinguishing variables for Chinese users, since China has a collectivist consumption culture. People always expect their behavior to meet social expectations and standards to avoid criticism and acquire social integration. Therefore, policy guidance, authoritative opinions, and people with important reference roles will significantly affect consumers' perceived trust and purchase intention. Familiarity and technology optimism are important influential factors that will have an indirect impact on the perceived trust. The related results of this study can help designers, practitioners, and researchers of the smart home industry produce products and services with higher perceived trust to improve consumers' adoption and acceptance so that the market penetration rate of related products and enterprises could be increased, and the maturity and development of the voice-enabled smart home industry could be promoted.","output":"What Influences the Perceived Trust of a Voice-Enabled Smart Home System: An Empirical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes findings from the Survey of Student Perceptions of Remote Teaching and Learning, which was administered to a random national sample of 1,008 U S undergraduates taking for-credit college courses that began with in-person classes and shifted to remote instruction in spring 2020 Course satisfaction levels were much lower after courses moved online, and students recounted an array of barriers to their continued learning More than 1 in 6 students experienced frequent internet connectivity issues and/or hardware and software problems severe enough to interfere with their ability to continue learning in their courses Students from all backgrounds struggled to stay motivated and missed getting immediate instructor feedback and collaborating with their fellow students Students of color and students from lower-income households experienced more challenges than did non-Hispanic White students and students from higher-income households However, even with the challenges of an unplanned shift to remote learning, a majority of students were at least somewhat satisfied with their learning in the course after COVID, and satisfaction was higher for those courses using more of the practices recommended for effective online instruction","output":"Teaching and Learning in the Time of COVID: The Student Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. It is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. In 1996 the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for empirical therapy of HAP. This review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ATS statement. Early diagnosis of HAP and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. Since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. Endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since culture results take 2C3 days, initial therapy of HAP is by definition empirical. Epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus (core pathogens). Empirical therapy covering only the core pathogens will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. Studies that have appeared since the ATS statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for HAP with multiresistant pathogens. In patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. The most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of HAP (5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus- baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. To further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. Antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance. Since the ATS statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. Therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for HAP should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.","output":"Nosocomial Pneumonia: Rationalizing the Approach to Empirical Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we argue that societies' unpreparedness and inadequate responses to the Covid-19 pandemic expose weaknesses in the foundations of the dominant economic paradigm We document how economics came to disembed itself from broader societal analysis and how this has influenced public policy in problematic ways, leading to privileging of efficiency over resilience We then go a step further to consider the role of economic evidence in public policy more generally Furthermore, we demonstrate how heterodox economics can enrich our understandings of our economies' weaknesses and of how to build a more resilient and just economy We conclude that we need an explanation of the crisis that is capable of seeing the economy as more than just markets and as embedded in society;one that is capable of linking the causes and consequences of the pandemic to our systems of production and distribution","output":"Changing the narrative: economics after COVID-19.

Although immediate hypersensitivity reactions have received much attention, delayed systemic urticarial reactions after vaccination can occur. Objective: To describe the clinical presentation, vaccine excipient skin testing results, and outcomes of subsequent COVID-19 vaccination in patients who experienced delayed systemic urticarial reactions after messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This was a retrospective case series of 12 patients referred to the Mayo Clinics in Rochester, Minnesota, and Jacksonville, Florida, between January 19, 2021, and April 30, 2021, for evaluation of delayed systemic urticarial reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Demographics, medical and allergic history, reaction details, vaccine excipient skin testing results (when performed), and the outcome after subsequent vaccination were collected for each patient. Results: The mean age of the patients was 52 years, all were white, and 9 (75%) were women. Half of the patients had a history of drug allergy, and one had a history of chronic spontaneous urticaria. Seven patients reacted to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and five reacted to the Moderna vaccine. Seven patients developed symptoms between 8 and 24 hours after vaccination. Nine patients required antihistamines for treatment. The median time to symptom resolution was 4 days. Nine patients underwent allergist-directed COVID-19 vaccine excipient skin testing, all of which were negative. Ten patients chose to receive their next mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, and four patients experienced recurrent delayed urticaria. Conclusion: Delayed systemic urticarial reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination were not life-threatening, could be treated with antihistamines, and were not predicted with vaccine excipient skin testing.

Detection of residual HCV in individuals with SVR after treatment of CHC can be significantly heightened by analyzing ex vivo mitogen\\\\activated T and B lymphocytes and applying sensitive nucleic acid amplification assays. However, it remained unknown if synergistic activation of lymphocytes and monocytes would further augment HCV detection, if viral replication becomes universally upregulated in treated cells, and if examining sequential sera and lymphoid cells would improve detection of occult infection. Using paired sera and lymphoid cells collected 1 year apart from 17 individuals with normal liver enzymes for up to 72 months after SVR, it was found that simultaneous activation of lymphocytes and monocytes enhanced identification of silent HCV infection and revealed that in some cases monocytes were the principal immune cell type where HCV persisted. Testing of serial samples further increased detection of occult infection. Ultimately, by combining the above two approaches, all individuals with SVR were found to be silent carriers of HCV. Clonal sequencing revealed HCV variations in sera and lymphoid cells and evolution of viral genomes confirming ongoing virus replication. Surprisingly, similar to those with CHC, naive lymphoid cells from some individuals carried 10(3) HCV copies/g total RNA. HCV loads in naive lymphoid cells predetermined the outcome of ex vivo stimulation with respect to upregulation or inhibition of HCV replication.

However, the SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Despite some differences in the cytokine patterns, it seems that the cytokine storm plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-, SARS- and MERS. Monocytes and macrophages may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2-dependent and ACE2-independent pathways. SARS-CoV-2 can effectively suppress the anti-viral IFN response in monocytes and macrophages. Since macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) act as antigen presenting cells (APCs), the infection of these cells by SARS-CoV-2 impairs the adaptive immune responses against the virus. Upon infection, monocytes migrate to the tissues where they become infected resident macrophages, allowing viruses to spread through all organs and tissues. The SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and macrophages can produce large amounts of numerous types of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to local tissue inflammation and a dangerous systemic inflammatory response called cytokine storm. Both local tissue inflammation and the cytokine storm play a fundamental role in the development of COVID-19-related complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Here, we describe the monocytes and macrophage responses during severe coronavirus infections, while highlighting potential therapeutic interventions to attenuate macrophage-related inflammatory reactions in possible approaches for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Contribution of monocytes and macrophages to the local tissue inflammation and cytokine storm in COVID-19: Lessons from SARS and MERS, and potential therapeutic interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reticulated platelets (RPs) are young thrombocytes, newly released from the bone marrow.

With the introduction of automated hematology analyzers in clinical routine, the determination of RPs, either as a total count or as a fraction, became more reliable, faster and more affordable. Currently, RPs are the focus of research in multiple clinical settings. In cardiovascular medicine, recent studies have focused on the relationship between RPs, coronary artery disease (CAD) and clinical outcomes, as well as the impact of RPs on the effects of antiplatelet therapy. Cohort studies showed increased levels of RPs in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or cardioembolic stroke. In patients with ACS, increased levels of RPs were also associated with an increased incidence of major ischemic cardiovascular events during follow-up. Further studies showed an association of levels of RPs with the antiplatelet response to less-potent P2Y12 inhibitors. In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing pulmonary vein isolation, levels of RPs differed significantly depending on the achieved rhythm (sinus rhythm vs. recurrent atrial fibrillation). Levels of RPs appear to also be predictive for bleeding events in patients with various hematological diagnoses.

The aim of the present study was to study the role of red blood cell distribution (RDW) as a biomarker for the early detection of severe sepsis defined clinically and also in the prediction of mortality from sepsis. METHODS: The cross-sectional study included a total of 175 subjects who met the inclusion criteria for the diagnosis of severe sepsis. After a thorough clinical examination, blood samples were taken from all patients within 3 hours of presenting the disease. The RDW values and other investigations were studied on the day of admission compared to other severity markers with the mortality index of 30 days. RESULT: The RDW value was significantly higher in patients with severe sepsis and in non-survivor patients than in survivors (P < .0001). There was a strong correlation between the SOFA score and RDW in predicting the disease outcome with the Pearson correlation coefficient of r = .46. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was found to be 0.852 at a CI of 95% (0.796-0.909) with RDW 17.15, sensitivity was 88.6% and specificity was 63.5%. There was a positive correlation with Pearsons correlation coefficient of r = .46 between RDW and the SOFA score. CONCLUSIONS: RDW can be used as a potential marker for the early detection of severe sepsis and in the prediction of the outcome.

Because the structures of different connexins are highly homologous and the functions of gap junctions formed by these connexins are similar, connexin-related hereditary diseases may share the same pathogenic mechanism.

Within twelve hrs after cell cultures were initiated, cytoplasmic vacuoles appeared in many of the RPTEC. The RPTEC henceforth deteriorated rapidly. Since SV40 induces the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles, this batch of RPTEC was rejected for the SV40 study. Nevertheless, we sought the likely cause(s) of the deterioration of the RPTEC as part of our technology development efforts. METHODS: Adventitious viruses in the RPTEC were isolated and/or detected and identified by isolation in various indicator cell lines, observation of cytopathology, an immunoflurorescence assay, electron microscopy, PCR, and sequencing. RESULTS: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was detected in some RPTEC by cytology, an immunofluorescence assay, and PCR. Human Herpesvirus 6B was detected by PCR of DNA extracted from the RPTEC, but was not isolated. Human coronavirus NL63 was isolated and identified by RT-PCR and sequencing, and its replication in a fresh batch of RPTEC and another type of primary human kidney cells was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: At least 3 different adventitious viruses were present in the batch of contaminated RPTEC. Whereas we are unable to determine whether the original RPTEC were pre-infected prior to their separation from other kidney cells, or had gotten contaminated with HCoV-NL63 from an ill laboratory worker during their preparation for commercial sale, our findings are a reminder that human-derived biologicals should always be considered as potential sources of infectious agents.

Limited data exist in England and Wales linking household overcrowding and risk of COVID-19. We used data collected from the Virus Watch cohort to examine the association between overcrowded households and infection to pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The Virus Watch study is a household community cohort of acute respiratory infections in England & Wales that began recruitment in June 2020. We calculated the persons per room for each household and classified accommodation as overcrowded when the number of roomswas fewer than the number of people. We considered two primary outcomes - PCR-confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Roche Elecsys anti-N total immunoglobulin assay). We used mixed effects logistic regression models that accounted for household structure to estimate the association between household overcrowding and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The proportion of participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was highest in the overcrowded group (6.6%; 73/1,102) and lowest in the under-occupied group (2.9%; 682/23,219). In a mixed effects logistic regression model that included age, sex, ethnicity, household income and geographical region as fixed effects, and a household-level random effect, we found strong evidence of an increased odds of having a positive PCR SARS-CoV-2 antigen result (Odds Ratio 3.67; 95% CI: 1.91, 7.06; p-value < 0.001) and increased odds of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen result in individuals living in overcrowded houses (2.99; 95% CI: 1.14, 7.81; p-value =0.03) compared to people living in under-occupied houses. Discussion: Public health interventions to prevent and stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 should consider the much greater risk of infection for people living in overcrowded households and pay greater attention to reducing household transmission.

In the present COVID?19 pandemic, however, many services offer aeromedical transport of patients with highly?infectious diseases in much smaller portable medical isolation units (PMIU), with the medical team on the outside, delivering care through portholes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all transports of patients with proven or suspected COVID?19 disease, transported by Jetcall, Idstein, Germany, between April 1 and August 1, 2020, using a PMIU (EpiShuttle, EpiGuard AS, Oslo, Norway). Demographics and medical data were analyzed using the services standardized transport protocols. Transport?associated challenges and optimization strategies were identified by interviewing and debriefing all transport teams after each transport. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with COVID?19 have been transported in a PMIU over distances up to 7,400 kilometers (km), with flight times ranging from 02:15 hours to 11:10 hours. We identified the main limitations of PMIU transports as limited access to the patient and reduced manual dexterity when delivering care through the porthole gloves and disconnection of lines and tubes during loading and unloading procedures. Technical solutions such as bluetooth?enabled stethoscopes, cordless ultrasound scanners and communication devices, meticulous preparation of the PMIU and the patient following standardized protocols and scenario?based training of crew members can reduce some of the risks.

The operations on COVID?19 patients were compared to procedures on non-COVID?19 patients with respect to temporal, structural and staff resources, exemplified by four interventions: transbrachial embolectomy, total hip arthroplasty (H-TEP), proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFN-A) and new implantations of cardiac pacemakers. RESULTS: The incision to suture times between the interventions in patients with COVID?19 and non-COVID?19 patients did not show any significant differences in any of the four interventions evaluated. The postoperative monitoring in the operating room, which is identified as time-consuming in many interventions, was often circumvented by postoperative transfer to the intensive care unit or by the use of local anesthetic procedures. For major operations, such as H?TEP, the preparation time was shown to be significantly longer (p = 0.037). Furthermore, there was a significantly higher requirement for anesthesia nursing personnel of 1.5 vs. 1.0 (p = 0.02).

Supplemental oxygen therapy is the main stay treatment for managing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a novel non-invasive strategy for better oxygenation and ventilation in critically ill patients. In this grim scenario, a reduction in mechanical ventilation by means of HFNC is of prime interest. Summary: HFNC is considered an aerosol-generating intervention with the risk of viral aerosolization with a concern of potential nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there is no consensus regarding the use of HFNC in novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP).

We monitored shedding of viral RNA and infectious virus and characterized the immune response kinetics of the first five patients quarantined in Geneva, Switzerland. High viral loads and infectious virus shedding were observed from the respiratory tract despite mild symptoms, with isolation of infectious virus and prolonged positivity by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) until days 7 and 19 after symptom onset, respectively. Robust innate responses characterized by increases in activated CD14+ CD16+ monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptom onset. Cellular and humoral severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2-specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients. Infectious virus shedding was limited to the first week after symptom onset. A strong innate response, characterized by mobilization of activated monocytes during the first days of infection and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, was detectable even in patients with mild disease.IMPORTANCE This work is particularly important because it simultaneously assessed the virology, immunology, and clinical presentation of the same subjects, whereas other studies assess these separately. We describe the detailed viral and immune profiles of the first five patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and quarantined in Geneva, Switzerland. Viral loads peaked at the very beginning of the disease, and infectious virus was shed only during the early acute phase of disease. No infectious virus could be isolated by culture 7 days after onset of symptoms, while viral RNA was still detectable for a prolonged period. Importantly, we saw that all patients, even those with mild symptoms, mount an innate response sufficient for viral control (characterized by early activated cytokines and monocyte responses) and develop specific immunity as well as cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive responses, which already begin to decline a few months after the resolution of symptoms.","output":"Daily Viral Kinetics and Innate and Adaptive Immune Response Assessment in COVID-19: a Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Collecting swab samples from the nasopharynx and oropharynx of patients with COVID-19 is essential in detecting SARS-CoV-2. This procedure potentially produces sufficient droplets. Since SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through droplets swab sampling has to be done carefully to prevent the risk of transmission to healthcare workers or the cross-contamination to the environment. The GAMA Swab Sampling Chamber (GSSC) is a positive-pressure chamber designed for collecting swab samples involving the healthcare worker positioned inside while the patient is outside the chamber. The chamber is designed to minimize the risk of aerosol exposure to the healthcare worker due to leakage or when opening or closing the door. Accordingly, the healthcare worker does not need to use complete personal protective equipment (PPE) as they do when collecting swab samples without the chamber. After several tests to check the safety and the chambers function the GSSC was used at Gadjah Mada Hospital. This chamber had been used to swab 51 asymptomatic patients 72 suspected patients and 284 voluntary persons for ten weeks. The results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examination of all samples from asymptomatic patients were negative while 2 of 72 suspected patients (2.8%) and 4 of 284 voluntary persons (1.4%) had positive RT-PCR results.

Many scholars have begun to discover key suscessful factors of crowdfunding projects. Previous studies have used questionnaires survey to identify important project features. In addition to requiring a lot of manpower and time, there may also be sampling bias. Moreover, related studies also reported that the project description will affect the success of the crowdfunding project, but there is no research to tell fundraisers which success factors should be included in the content of the project description. Besides, in recent years, game crowdfunding projects have been attracted lots of attention in terms of total fundraising amount and number of projects. Moreover, in traditional feature selection and text mining approaches, the selected terms are un-organized and hard to be explained. Therefore, this study will focus on real video and mobile game project descriptions to replace conventional questionnaires. To solve these issues, we present a lexicon-based feature selection method. We attempt to define content features and build lexicons to determine the attributes values. Three feature selection methods including decision tree (DT), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and support vector machineCrecursive feature elimination (SVMCRFE) will be employed to find organized candidate key successful factors. Then, support vector machines (SVM) will be used to evaluate the performances of candidate feature subsets.

Following the outbreak of the pandemic, various countries implemented strict precautionary measures to curb the spread of the virus. It is expected that certain vulnerable populations will be most affected, such as children with special needs due to the interruption of regular intervention and routines which are pivotal in their day-to-day lives. Objectives Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the Singapore COVID-19 Circuit Breaker (two-month lockdown) measures on children with special needs and their families. Methods Caregivers of children who attended a tertiary child development unit completed an anonymous online survey form. There were 84 respondents who were parents of children aged 2 to 16 years (mean 6.5 years). Results Majority of the children were in preschool/lower primary with 78.6% males and 65.5% Chinese. The most common diagnosis was Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD;46.4%). Almost two-thirds of caregivers reported working from home during the Circuit Breaker period. The majority indicated that their children had no difficulties coping with the restrictions in place during this period. Of those who did, the main difficulties were with wearing a mask, being restricted from going out, and having to practice social distancing. 26.2% of children had deterioration in their behavior, and a third of caregivers struggled to manage this. There was no significant difference in proportion of children experiencing a deterioration in behavior by diagnostic group [X2 (d.f.=6, N=84) =5.7, p=0.47]. Yet some (16.7%) had improvements in behavior. Sleep was minimally affected, but there was a significant increase in screen use in 81% of cases, especially in children with ASD. The majority of children received home-based learning from schools but many encountered challenges with this. About two -third of children continued to receive their early intervention or hospital-based therapy services. 54.7% of caregivers reported feeling more stressed than usual, mainly from juggling work-vs-family commitments. In spite of all the challenges, around two-thirds reported being able to spend more quality time with their child and over a half over a half of them reported having improved relationships with their child Conclusions This survey shows that whilst many coped with the restrictive lockdown measures, there are those families who are more vulnerable, or caregivers who are less adept, and who need to be identified early for future support. Parents have the potential to be effective therapy providers in the home setting, given adequate support, but may struggle to balance work and family commitments.

METHODS Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we evaluated trends in the proportion of carotid revascularization procedures performed at high volume centers in the USA from 2005 to 2011. High volume was defined as combined endarterectomy/stenting volume  130 patients/year, carotid endarterectomy volume  117 cases/year and carotid stenting volume  38 cases/year. In-hospital mortality, discharge to a long-term facility, intracranial hemorrhage, and postoperative stroke rates were compared between high and low volume centers. RESULTS A total of 181,972 patients were included in this study. Overall, 63,442 patients (34.9%) were treated at high volume centers. The proportion of patients treated at high volume carotid revascularization centers decreased from 38.3% in 2005-2006 to 30.2% in 2010-2011. The proportion of patients treated at high volume centers decreased from 35.7% to 30.0% for carotid endarterectomy (p<0.0001) and 45.2% to 35.1% for carotid stenting.

Although NIRS cerebral oximetry is being increasingly used in many clinical settings, interdevice technologic differences suggest potential variation in the ability to accurately acquire brain oxygenation signals. The primary objective of this study was to determine if NIRS-derived regional cerebral oxygen saturation measurements accurately account for oxygen saturation contamination from extracranial tissue. METHODS Twelve healthy volunteers had each of three NIRS devices (FORE-SIGHT [CAS Medical Systems Inc; Brandford, CT], INVOS 5100C-PB [Covidien; Boulder, CO], and EQUANOX Classic 7600 [Nonin Medical Inc; Plymouth, MN]) randomly applied to the forehead. After this, a circumferential pneumatic head cuff was positioned such that when inflated, hypoxia-ischemia would be produced in the extracranial scalp tissue beneath the NIRS cerebral oximeters. Comparisons among the three devices were made of the NIRS measurements before and following hypoxia-ischemia produced in the scalp tissue with inflation of the head cuff. RESULTS The induction of extracranial hypoxia-ischemia resulted in a significant reduction in regional cerebral oxygen saturation measurements in all three NIRS devices studied. At 5 min postinflation of the pneumatic head cuff, the INVOS demonstrated a 16.6  9.6% (mean  SD) decrease from its baseline (P = 0.0001), the FORE-SIGHT an 11.8  5.3% decrease from its baseline (P < 0.0001), and the EQUANOX a 6.8  6.0% reduction from baseline (P = 0.0025).

We do not necessarily advocate change, but rather encourage critical reflection on current practices and the need for prospective studies.

Objective To investigated how real illness experiences inform simulated participants' (SP) portrayals in simulation education using a scoping review to map literature. Study selection Arksey and O'Malley's framework was used to search, select, chart and analyse data with the assistance of personal and public involvement. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched. A final consultation exercise was conducted using results. Findings 37 articles were within scope. Reporting and training of SPs are inconsistent. SPs were actors, volunteers or the person with the illness experience. Real illness experience was commonly drawn on in communication interactions. People with illness experience could be directly involved in various ways, such as through conversation with an SP, or indirectly, such as a recording of heart sounds. The impact on the learner was rarely considered. Conclusion Authentic illness experiences help create meaningful person-centred simulation education. Patients and SPs may both require support when sharing or portraying illness experience. Patients' voices profoundly enrich the educational contributions made by SPs.","output":"Nothing about me without me: a scoping review of how illness experiences inform simulated participants' encounters in health profession education."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Green tea extracts effectively inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Serially 10-fold diluted solutions of catechin mixture reagent from green tea were mixed with the viral culture fluid at a volume ratio of nine to one, respectively, and kept at room temperature for 5 min. The solution of 10 mg/mL catechin reagent reduced the viral titer by 4.2 log and 1.0 mg/mL solution reduced only by one log. Pre-infection treatment of the cells with the reagent alone did not affect the viral growth. In addition, cells treated with only the reagent was assayed for host-cell viability using the WST-8 system and almost no host-cell damage by the treatment was observed. These findings suggested that the direct treatment of virus with the reagent before inoculation decreased the viral activity and that catechins might have a potential to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Catechins from Green Tea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Estimating the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at any specific time point is always a challenge due to asymptomatic cases, the incubation period and testing delays. Here we use an empirical analysis of cumulative death count, transmission-to-death time lag, and infection fatality rate (IFR) to evaluate and estimate the actual cases at a specific time point as a strategy of tracking the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: This method mainly uses death count, as COVID-19 related deaths are arguably more reliably reported than infection case numbers. Using an IFR estimate of 0.66%, we back-calculate the number of cases that would result in the cumulative number of deaths at a given time point in South Africa between 27 February and 14 April. We added the mean incubation period (6.4 days) and the onset-to-death time lag (17.8 days) to identify the estimated time lag between transmission and death (25 days, rounded up). We use the statistical programming language R to analyze the data and produce plots. RESULTS: We estimate 28,182 cases as of 14 April, compared with 3,465 reported cases. Weekly growth rate of actual cases dropped immediately after lockdown implementation and has remained steady, measuring at 51.2% as of 14 April. The timing of drop in growth rate suggests that South Africas infection prevention strategy may have been effective at reducing viral transmission. CONCLUSION: Estimating the actual number of cases at a specific time point can support evidence-based policies to reduce and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Non-reported, asymptomatic, hard to reach and, mild cases are possible sources of outbreaks that could emerge after lockdown. Therefore, close monitoring, optimized screening strategy and prompt response to COVID-19 could help in stopping the spread of the virus.","output":"Estimating actual COVID-19 case numbers using cumulative death count-A method of measuring effectiveness of lockdown of non-essential activities: a South African case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution and solid pollution are considered global problems, and endanger human health mainly due to the emission of fine particulate matter released into the atmosphere and improper disposal of post-consumer plastic bottles. Therefore, it is urgent to develop filter media to effectively protect the public. The properties of plastics make them potential candidates for nanofiber mat formers due to their attractive structural and mechanical characteristics. This work aims to produce and evaluate novel PET electrospun fibers dispensed with the use of support materials to be used as filter media to remove nanoparticles from the air. The electrospinning process was carried out by changing the concentration of the polymer solution, the needle diameter, and the electrospinning processing time at two rotation speeds. The average diameters of the micro- and nanofibers of the filter media produced ranged from 3.25 m to 0.65 m and it was possible to conclude that, as the size of the fibers decreased, the mechanical strength increased from 3.2 to 4.5 MPa. In filtration tests, a collection efficiency of up to 99% with low-pressure drops (19.4 Pa) was obtained for nanoparticles, demonstrating high quality factor filter media, which could be applicable in gas filtration.","output":"Development of Filter Media by Electrospinning for Air Filtration of Nanoparticles from PET Bottles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline coronavirus is a highly contagious virus potentially resulting in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), while the pathogenesis of FIP remains not well understood, particularly in the events leading to the disease. A predominant theory is that the pathogenic FIPV arises from a mutation, so that it could replicate not only in enterocytes of the intestines but also in monocytes, subsequently systemically transporting the virus. The immune status and genetics of affected cats certainly play an important role in the pathogenesis. Considering the importance of genetics and host immune responses in viral infections, the goal of this study was to elucidate host gene expression in macrophages using RNA sequencing. Macrophages from healthy male cats infected with FIPV 79-1146 ex vivo displayed a differential host gene expression. Despite the virus uptake, aligned viral reads did not increase from 2 to 17 h. The overlap of host gene expression among macrophages from different cats was limited, even though viral transcripts were detected in the cells. Interestingly, some of the downregulated genes in all macrophages were involved in immune signaling, while some upregulated genes common for all cats were found to be inhibiting immune activation. Our results highlight individual host responses playing an important role, consistent with the fact that few cats develop feline infectious peritonitis despite a common presence of enteric FCoV.","output":"Host Gene Expression of Macrophages in Response to Feline Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The spread of COVID-19 has posed significant challenges for dental professionals worldwide. The aims of the present study were twofold: (i) to study the attitudes, emotional responses, and worries among the dental personnel; and (ii) to look for the ability of dental personnel to experience posttraumatic self-growth as a result of the distress caused by the pandemic. METHOD AND MATERIALS A cross-sectional online survey using an anonymous questionnaire was performed simultaneously in Israel, Canada, and France during the initial lockdown period. RESULTS Israeli dental practitioners were less worried about their physical health, mental health, or relationships with family and friends than their Canadian and French counterparts. The Canadian dental practitioners were most committed and most willing to treat their patients, as well as most concerned about not being able to treat patients in the same personal way as before the lockdown. French dental practitioners showed the highest level of fear to treat patients. There were no differences in dental practitioners' levels of anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic growth among the countries. Dental practitioners' posttraumatic growth was significantly associated with worries regarding their physical health. CONCLUSION Responses of dental personnel to the COVID-19 pandemic varied worldwide. Despite the differences, evidence exists that some of the dental practitioners' worries and concerns are associated with psychologic growth as a result of the pandemic. Better understanding and acknowledgment of dental personnel's worries and concerns can facilitate growth and enable positive functioning under the continuous situation of uncertainty.","output":"Dental personnel in Israel, Canada, and France during the COVID-19 pandemic: attitudes, worries, emotional responses, and posttraumatic growth."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(D,[["render",V]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/66.md","filePath":"doctor/66.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/66.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
