We present a sexual health survey instrument and implementation considerations for population-level sexual health research. The brief, comprehensive sexual health survey and consensus statement was developed via a multi-step process (an open call, a hackathon, and a modified Delphi process). The survey items, domains, entire instruments, and implementation considerations to develop a sexual health survey were solicited via a global crowdsourcing open call. The open call received 175 contributions from 49 countries. Following review of submissions from the open call, 18 finalists and eight facilitators with expertise in sexual health research, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), were invited to a 3-day hackathon to harmonize a survey instrument. Consensus was achieved through an iterative, modified Delphi process that included three rounds of online surveys. The entire process resulted in a 19-item consensus statement and a 10-minute sexual health survey instrument. This is the first global consensus on a sexual and reproductive health survey instrument that can be used to generate cross-national comparative data in both high-income and LMICs. The inclusive process identified priority domains for improvement and can inform the design of sexual and reproductive health programs and contextually relevant data for comparable research across countries.","output":"Using a crowdsourcing open call, hackathon and a modified Delphi method to develop a consensus statement and sexual health survey instrument"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug release from microparticle-based topical gels may affect their bioavailability, safety and efficacy. This work sought to elucidate spatial distribution of the drug within the microparticle matrix and how this impacts the product's critical performance attributes. The purpose of this research was to inform the development of in vitro characterization approaches to support a demonstration of bioequivalence. Drug-free microparticles were loaded with tretinoin or drug-loaded microparticles were separated from purchased Retin-A Micro? (tretinoin) topical gel drug products. The resultant microparticles were analyzed for tretinoin content, drug loading efficiency, morphology, surface topography, surface pore size distribution, particle size distribution and tretinoin release. The solid-state characteristics and chemical interaction of tretinoin with the microparticles were also investigated. Microparticles loaded with tretinoin made in-house and those separated from Retin-A Micro? (tretinoin) topical gel were spherical, polydisperse and free of aggregates. The surface porosity of the microparticles was a19.8% with an average pore size of a327 nm. Microparticles loaded with tretinoin in-house were smaller in size and exhibited faster drug release than those separated from Retin-A Micro? (tretinoin) topical gel. Tretinoin release was found to increase with an increase in the drug loading. Based on XRD and DSC data, tretinoin was present in an amorphous state. The FTIR spectra indicated a disappearance of carbonyl band of microparticles and shifting of the hydroxyl band of tretinoin due to hydrogen bonding. The extent of drug loading and the solid-state interaction of tretinoin with the microparticles may be critical for drug release.

Antibiotics are losing their effectiveness due to the emerging infectious diseases, the scarcity of novel antibiotics, and the contributions of antibiotic misuse and overuse to resistance. Characterization of the lipidomic response to pneumonia and exploring the lipidomic phenotype can provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis and potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic treatments. METHODS: Lipid profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were generated through untargeted lipidomic profiling analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify possible sources of variations among samples. Partitioning clustering analysis (k-means) was employed to evaluate the existence of distinct lipidomic clusters. RESULTS: PCA showed that BALF lipidomes differed significantly between CAP (n = 52) and controls (n = 68, including 35 healthy volunteers and 33 patients with non-infectious lung diseases); while no clear separation was found between severe CAP and non-severe CAP cases. Lactosylceramides were the most prominently elevated lipid constituent in CAP. Clustering analysis revealed three separate lipid profiles; subjects in each cluster exhibited significant differences in disease severity, incidence of hypoxemia, percentages of phagocytes in BALF, and serum concentrations of albumin and total cholesterol (all p < 0.05). In addition, SM (d34:1) was negatively related to macrophage (adjusted r = ? 0.462, p < 0.0001) and PE (18:1p/20:4) was positively correlated with polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) percentages of BALF (adjusted r = 0.541, p < 0.0001). The 30-day mortality did not differ amongst three clusters (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that specific lower airway lipid composition is related to different intensities of host inflammatory responses, and may contribute to functionally relevant shifts in disease pathogenesis in CAP individuals. These findings argue for the need to tailor therapy based on specific lipid profiles and related inflammatory status. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03093220).

Chloroquine is known to prolong the QRS and QTc interval on the ECG. To assess the effect of chloroquine on QRS and QTc intervals in COVID-19 patients, we included all inpatients treated with chloroquine for COVID-19 in the Spaarne Gasthuis (Haarlem/Hoofddorp, the Netherlands) and had an ECG performed both in the 72 h before and during or at least 48 h after treatment. We analyzed the (change in) QRS and QTc interval using the one-sample t-test. Of the 106 patients treated with chloroquine, 70 met the inclusion criteria. The average change in QRS interval was 6.0 ms (95% CI 3.3-8.7) and the average change in QTc interval was 32.6 ms (95% CI 24.9-40.2) corrected with the Bazett's formula and 38.1 ms (95% CI 30.4-45.9) corrected with the Fridericia's formula.

Thus, these initiatives have contributed to the efficiency of traditional analog activities by using data and smart algorithms. In contrast, the efficiency of the underlying data management was largely neglected, but the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted its importance. To overcome the limited emphasis on sustainability and efficiency in the digital context, this paper focuses on data management efficiency. After detailing this concept, it is linked to the growing literature about creating shared value, and a process segmentation for implementing shared value innovations in the field of digital efficiency is developed.Originality/valueThe paper extends research into digital transformation by emphasizing that the distinction of effectiveness and efficiency is as relevant in the digital context as in the traditional analog environment. It further provides new insights into creating shared value because it increases the awareness of researchers and managers to consider data management efficiency as a basis for shared value innovation with positive effects on the triple bottom line.

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardised tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway.

DESIGN/DATA SOURCES: Using in-person, email, and videoconference exchanges, we convened an interprofessional clinical research group, conducted a literature review of empirical studies, ethics documents and expert commentaries (2010 to present), and viewed traditional and social media posts (March 2020 to May 2020). Stakeholder consultation involved scientific, ethics, clinical, and administrative leaders. SETTING: Clinical research in the ICU. PATIENTS: Patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: While clinical research should be prioritized to advantage patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in order to care for affected patients, it ideally would not unduly disadvantage patients without coronavirus disease 2019. Thus, timely, rigorous, relevant, and ethical clinical research is needed to improve the care and optimize outcomes for both patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019, acknowledging how many studies that are not exclusively focused on coronavirus disease 2019 remain relevant to patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

Here we report the feasibility of conducting IO physician consultations via telehealth in 2020 and compare patient characteristics to prior in-person consultations conducted in 2019. METHODS: An integrated EHR-telemedicine platform was used for IO physician consultations. As in the prior in-person visits, patients completed pre-visit patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments about common cancer symptoms [modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, (ESAS)], Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCaW), and the PROMIS-10 to assess quality of life (QOL). Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and PROs for new telehealth consultation in 2020 were compared to new in-person consultations in 2019 using t-tests, chi-squared tests, and -Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: We provided telehealth IO consultations to 509 new patients from April 21, 2020, to October 21, 2020, versus 842 new patients in-person during the same period in 2019. Most were female (77 % vs 73%); median age (56 vs 58), and the most frequent cancer type was breast (48% vs 39%).

Therefore, work on fluorescent sensors based on 8-aminoquinoline as tools to detect Zn(2+) ions in environmental and biological applications has been popular. Introducing various carboxamide groups into an 8-aminoquinoline molecule to create 8-amidoquinoline derivatives to improve water solubility and cell membrane permeability is also a recent trend. This review aims to present a general overview of the fluorophore 8-aminoquinoline and its derivatives as Zn(2+) receptors for zinc sensor probes. Various fluorescent chemosensor designs based on 8-amidoquinoline and their effectiveness and potential as a recognition probe for zinc analysis were discussed. Based on this review, it can be concluded that derivatives of 8-amidoquinoline have vast potential as functional receptors for zinc ions primarily because of their fast reactivity, good selectivity, and bio-compatibility, especially for biological applications. To better understand the Zn(2+) ion fluorophores function, diversity of the coordination complex and geometries need further studies. This review provides information in elucidating, designing, and exploring new 8-amidoquinoline derivatives for future studies for the improvement of chemosensors that are selective and sensitive to Zn(2+).","output":"The Role of 8-Amidoquinoline Derivatives as Fluorescent Probes for Zinc Ion Determination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is diagnosed by molecular-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. METHODS: Specimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. RESULTS: Abbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at > 30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohen's kappa varied between 0.86 and 0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM < 14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG &#8805; 14 days. CONCLUSION: The Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV < 14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM improves clinical sensitivity early in disease course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is anticipated that the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated societal response will have wide-ranging impacts on youth development and mental health.

This may be particularly true for children and adolescents who are at heightened risk for the onset of sleep and mental health disturbances and for those whom developmental changes impacting sleep are rapidly occurring. Youth with preexisting psychopathologies (including anxiety and depression) and neurodevelopmental conditions (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder) could be especially vulnerable to disturbed sleep during this period of change and uncertainty.

This discrepancy fueled speculations that the rise of reported cases would not reflect a second wave but only wider testing. We find that this apparent discrepancy can be explained to a large extent by the age structure of the infected, and predict a pronounced increase of death counts in the near future, as the spread once again expands into older age groups. To re-establish control, and to avoid the tipping point when TTI capacity is exceeded, case numbers have to be lowered.

A total of 222 WWTP and 192 neighborhood samples were collected from June 2020 to May 2021, encompassing the end of the first-wave (June 2020), the second-wave (November end to December, 2020) and the third-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (mid-April to May, 2021). Flow-weighted 24-hour composite samples were processed to extract RNA that was then analyzed for two SARS-CoV-2-specific regions of the nucleocapsid gene, N1 and N2, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Using this approach SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 98.06 % (406/414) of wastewater samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance was compared to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases organized by the three-digit postal code of affected individuals primary residences, enabling correlation analysis at neighborhood, WWTP and city-wide scales. Strong correlations were observed between N1 & N2 gene signals in wastewater and new daily cases for WWTPs and neighborhoods. Similarly, when flow rates at Calgarys three WWTPs were used to normalize observed concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and combine them into a city-wide signal, this was strongly correlated with regionally diagnosed COVID-19 cases and clinical test percent positivity rate. Linked census data demonstrated disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from areas of the city with lower socioeconomic status and more racialized communities.

METHODS: All members of the BSCI/BSCCT were invited to submit research questions that they considered to be of the highest clinical and/or academic priority in the field of cardiovascular imaging (phase 1). Subsequently a steering committee removed duplicate questions and combined questions of a similar theme by consensus agreement where appropriate. BSCI/BSCCT members were invited to rank the resulting research questions in two further iterative rounds (phases 2 and 3) to determine a final list of high-priority research questions. RESULTS: A total of 111 research questions were submitted in phase 1 by 30 BSCI/BSCCT members. While there was a broad range of topics, from determining the optimal features/markers of the vulnerable plaque to investigating how cardiac imaging can best be used to maximise clinical outcomes and economic costs, multimodality imaging-related (n=44, 40%) questions dominated the categories and coronary artery imaging (n=40, 36%) was the most common topic. Over two iterative rounds of prioritisation of these research questions, the original 111 were reduced to 75 questions in round 2, and 25 in round 3. From these 25 a final Top 10 list was distilled by consensus grouping.

However, the risk factors of ATE after these VTE remain unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using cause-specific hazard regression models, we determined risk factors of ATE (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, digestive tract ischemia, or renal ischemia) in 2242 patients with unprovoked VTE and in 914 patients with cancer-associated VTE from a multi-center prospective cohort. RESULTS: Of patients with unprovoked-VTE, 174 developed ATE (7.8%, incidence: 1.26 per 100 patient-years) during follow-up (median: 68 months). Among patients with cancer-associated VTE, 57 developed ATE (6.2%, incidence: 1.98 per 100 patient-years) during follow-up (median: 30 months). After multivariable analysis, the identified risk factors of ATE in patients with unprovoked-VTE were age > 65 years (vs. <50 years, HR 2.59, 95% CI: 1.56-4.29), past history of symptomatic atherosclerosis (HR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.40-3.19), and treatment with low molecule weight heparin (vs. vitamin K antagonists, HR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.13-4.52). In patients with cancer-associated VTE, the identified risk factors of ATE were: past history of symptomatic atherosclerosis (HR: 3.13, 95% CI: 1.72-5.67), and ongoing anticoagulation at the diagnosis of VTE (HR: 2.77, 95% CI: 1.07-7.22).

The primary objective of this study is to determine the variables associated with patient acceptation or refusal to participate in clinical research. Specifically, we sought to evaluate if distrust in pharmaceutical companies and associated psychosocial factors could represent a recruitment bias in clinical trials and thus threaten the applicability of their results. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter survey consisted in the administration of a self-questionnaire to patients during a pulmonology consultation. The 1025 questionnaires distributed collected demographics, socio-professional and basic health literacy characteristics. Patients were asked to rank their level of trust for pharmaceutical companies and indicate their willingness to participate in different categories of research (pre or post marketing, sponsored by an academic institution or pharmaceutical company). Logistic regression was used to determine factors contributing to trust versus distrust group membership and willingness to participate in each category of research. RESULTS: One thousand patients completed the survey, corresponding to a response rate of 97.5%. Data from 838 patients were analyzed in this study. 48.3% of respondents declared that they trusted pharmaceutical companies, while 35.5% declared distrust.

Majority of Indian strains fall in A2a and O clusters. Alarmingly, we have observed six SNPs at RBD and notably two of them at RBM (S438F and S494P). S494P SNP, similar to BatCSARS like-CoV, may indicate a low ACE2 binding affinity. Interestingly 38% of Indian strains harbor a characteristic D614G SNP which was found predominantly in A2a cluster, mostly comprising USA and European strains with high disease severity. The association of disease severity with D614G SNP is well-correlated in states with high death rate except Maharashtra. Notably, more than 50% of D614G mutation were observed in Northern part of India and 14% in Southern part but not in Kerala and Tamil Nadu strains. Highly conserved motif, D614 (608-VAVLYQDVNCT-618) in upstream and also few downstream, of S1/S2 furin cleavage site may indicate specific key role in efficient interaction with host proteases in pathogenesis. Further studies are warranted to clarify the impact of SD614G SNP association to disease severity . Interestingly, C2367T (Y789Y) synonymous SNP is observed in 37% of Indian strains and notably similar SNPs with degeneracy bases were observed which is a key indication for the possibility of misdiagnosis by Real-Time PCR and revised strategies are needed for the precise diagnosis. Circulation of high number of signature SNPs [D614G and C2367T (Y789Y)] in certain states may be an early indication of emergence of community transmission in India. Further large genome sequence data from India will aid in deep understanding on the diversity of circulating SASR-Cov-2 and its impact on disease severity, origin of imported cases to India, community spread, effect on diagnosis and vaccine coverage.","output":"Emergence of RBD and D614G Mutations in Spike Protein: An Insight from Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The first shelter-in-place (SIP) order in the United States was issued across six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on critical care resources.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on these aspects, while exploring the role of community pharmacists. A cross-sectional study was conducted via a web-based questionnaire that targeted individuals who suffer from chronic diseases in Jordan. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling and were asked to self-report their ability to access medication, and the perceived role of community pharmacists. Among the 431 participants, the mean age  SD (years) was 53.8  13.7 and 60.1% (n= 259) were females.

More specifically, it attempts to shed light on media trends and prospects as educational activities and techniques, as well as on the utmost importance of the use of television content as audiovisual educational content. This venture focuses on the cases of Cyprus and Greece following literature materials and reviews, research results, and findings of previous numerous studies and research papers from and through the Internet that were considered as background. The aforementioned were applied in a pilot case study with adult educators as adult learners (18 years and older), providing literature data and historical elements as a source of further study. The findings from the pilot case study revealed that the television content can also shape (adult) learners perceptions on how they understand and learn in an online environment in regard to the generational cohort they belong. Furthermore, the results disclosed that an online educational process utilizing audiovisual media technologies and audiovisual content (audiovisual media communications) may support technology-enhanced learning through non-verbal communication in the new streamlined digital era in which we live.

These issues are most likely to be local and involve interconnected economic, social and environmental concerns. RESULTS: The following study contributes to the understanding of the everyday politics of young people within a single urban environment (London) regarding sustainability-related issues. It departs from many previous studies of sustainability by employing a youth-centred approach, focussing on the authentic voices of young Londoners. The article shows how narrative structures can provide an effective way of understanding everyday politics and the interconnectedness of key issues through the words of these young people. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identifies young peoples relatively low prioritisation of most environmental issues C due to an overwhelming sense of economic precarity and a lack of opportunity to reflect upon the relevance of environmental issues for their everyday lives.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational study we enrolled all patients presenting to the emergency department of a Milan-based university hospital from February 24th to April 8th 2020 who underwent nasopharyngeal swab for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and anteroposterior bedside CXR within 12a?h. A composite reference standard combining RT-PCR results with phone-call-based anamnesis was obtained. Radiologists were grouped by CXR reading experience (Group-1, >10 years; Group-2, <10 years), diagnostic performance indexes were calculated for each radiologist and for the two groups. RESULTS: Group-1 read 435 CXRs (77.0 % disease prevalence): sensitivity was 89.0 %, specificity 66.0 %, accuracy 83.7 %. Group-2 read 100 CXRs (73.0 % prevalence): sensitivity was 89.0 %, specificity 40.7 %, accuracy 76.0 %. During the first half of the outbreak (195 CXRs, 66.7 % disease prevalence), overall sensitivity was 80.8 %, specificity 67.7 %, accuracy 76.4 %, Group-1 sensitivity being similar to Group-2 (80.6 % versus 81.5 %, respectively) but higher specificity (74.0 % versus 46.7 %) and accuracy (78.4 % versus 69.0 %). During the second half (340 CXRs, 81.8 % prevalence), overall sensitivity increased to 92.8 %, specificity dropped to 53.2 %, accuracy increased to 85.6 %, this pattern mirrored in both groups, with decreased specificity (Group-1, 58.0 %; Group-2, 33.3 %) but increased sensitivity (92.7 % and 93.5 %) and accuracy (86.5 % and 81.0 %, respectively).

We undertook a systematic review of cardiac adverse effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in children and young people (CYP)< 18 years. Methods Systematic review with protocol prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021275380). Six electronic databases were searched from 1 December 2019 to 14 September 2021. Eligible studies were those reporting on CYP with reported or proven myocarditis, pericarditis and/or myopericarditis associated with vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. We summarized findings across all clinical cases reported in case report / case series studies. As a number of studies reported data from two publicly available vaccine surveillance systems, we updated estimates of reporting rates for cardiac adverse events up to 31 October for the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and 13 November for EudraVigilance covering European Union and European Economic Area (EUEA) countries. Results Twenty-one studies were included from 338 identified records. Seventeen were case re-ports/series describing a total of 127 CYP. Three studies described reporting rates from passive surveillance databases (VAERS, EudraVigilance, and the WHO VigiBase) and one de-scribed 22 cases from the US Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). Clinical series reported that 99.2% presented with chest pain, 100% had raised troponin and 73.8% had an abnormal ECG. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in 91 cases identified myocardial injury in 61.5%, with 90.1% showing late gadolinium enhancement. NSAIDs were the most common treatment (76.0%). One US dataset (VSD) estimated a significant excess of 29.6 events per million vaccine doses across both sexes and doses. There were 1129 reports of myocarditis and 358 reports of pericarditis from across the USA and EU/EEA. The VAERS reporting rate per million for myocarditis was 12.4 for boys and 1.4 for girls after the first dose, and 49.6 for boys and 6.1 for girls after the second dose. There was a marked trend for VAERS reporting to be highest soon after initiation of the vaccine schedule, suggesting reporting bias. Conclusions Cardiac adverse effects are very rare after mRNA vaccination for COVID-19 in CYP <18 years. The great majority of cases are mild and self-limiting without significant treatment. No data are yet available on children under 12 years. Larger detailed longitudinal studies are urgently needed from active surveillance sources.","output":"Systematic review of cardiac adverse effects in children and young people un-der 18 years of age after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of immunosuppressive therapy after liver transplantation on activities of daily living and fear of death during the COVID-19 pandemic.

They differ from e-cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Companies who make HTPs claim they produce fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarettes. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using HTPs, so clinicians need to know whether they are effective for this purpose and relatively safe. Also, to regulate HTPs appropriately, policymakers should understand their impact on health and on cigarette smoking prevalence. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HTPs for smoking cessation and the impact of HTPs on smoking prevalence. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and six other databases for relevant records to January 2021, together with reference-checking and contact with study authors and relevant groups. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people who smoked cigarettes were randomised to switch to exclusive HTP use or a control condition. Eligible outcomes were smoking cessation, adverse events, and selected biomarkers. RCTs conducted in clinic or in an ambulatory setting were deemed eligible when assessing safety, including those randomising participants to exclusively use HTPs, smoke cigarettes, or attempt abstinence from all tobacco. Time-series studies were also eligible for inclusion if they examined the population-level impact of heated tobacco on smoking prevalence or cigarette sales as an indirect measure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking at the longest follow-up point available, adverse events, serious adverse events, and changes in smoking prevalence or cigarette sales. Other outcomes included biomarkers of harm and exposure to toxicants/carcinogens (e.g. NNAL and carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb)). We used a random-effects Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences on the log-transformed scale (LMD) with 95% CIs. We pooled data across studies using meta-analysis where possible. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 completed studies, of which 11 were RCTs assessing safety (2666 participants) and two were time-series studies. We judged eight RCTs to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk. All RCTs were funded by tobacco companies. Median length of follow-up was 13 weeks. No studies reported smoking cessation outcomes. There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events between smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or continue smoking cigarettes, limited by imprecision and risk of bias (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 1713 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether risk of serious adverse events differed between groups due to very serious imprecision and risk of bias (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.94; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1472 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence for lower NNAL and COHb at follow-up in heated tobacco than cigarette smoking groups, limited by risk of bias (NNAL: LMD -0.81, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.55; I2 = 92%; 10 studies, 1959 participants; COHb: LMD -0.74, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.52; I2 = 96%; 9 studies, 1807 participants). Evidence for additional biomarkers of exposure are reported in the main body of the review. There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events in smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or attempt abstinence from all tobacco, limited by risk of bias and imprecision (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.46; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 237 participants). Five studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred in either group (533 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, that urine concentrations of NNAL at follow-up were higher in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group (LMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 382 participants). In addition, there was very low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, for higher COHb in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group for intention-to-treat analyses (LMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.31; 3 studies, 212 participants), but lower COHb in per-protocol analyses (LMD -0.32, 95% CI -1.04 to 0.39; 2 studies, 170 participants). Evidence concerning additional biomarkers is reported in the main body of the review. Data from two time-series studies showed that the rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated following the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan. This evidence was of very low-certainty as there was risk of bias, including possible confounding, and cigarette sales are an indirect measure of smoking prevalence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No studies reported on cigarette smoking cessation, so the effectiveness of heated tobacco for this purpose remains uncertain. There was insufficient evidence for differences in risk of adverse or serious adverse events between people randomised to switch to heated tobacco, smoke cigarettes, or attempt tobacco abstinence in the short-term. There was moderate-certainty evidence that heated tobacco users have lower exposure to toxicants/carcinogens than cigarette smokers and very low- to moderate-certainty evidence of higher exposure than those attempting abstinence from all tobacco. Independently funded research on the effectiveness and safety of HTPs is needed. The rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated after the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan but, as data were observational, it is possible other factors caused these changes. Moreover, falls in cigarette sales may not translate to declining smoking prevalence, and changes in Japan may not generalise elsewhere. To clarify the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking prevalence, there is a need for time-series studies that examine this association.","output":"Heated tobacco products for smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-medication with antibiotics is a major contributing factor to antimicrobial resistance. Prior research examining factors associated with antibiotic self-medication has focused on an individuals knowledge about antibiotics, antibiotic usage practices, accessibility to antibiotic medication, and demographic characteristics. The role of psychological distress associated with perceived health risks in explaining antibiotic self-medication is less understood. This study was designed to address this knowledge gap in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. An online survey of 2217 participants was conducted at the height of the initial outbreak and revealed that 19.5% of participants took antibiotics to protect themselves from COVID-19. Multivariate logistic analysis examined the predictors of taking antibiotics for protection against COVID-19. An integrative framework developed from the results illustrates potential pathways and facilitating factors that may contribute to prophylactic self-medication with antibiotics. Specifically, COVID-19 pandemic-induced psychological distress was significantly positively related to self-medication. Preventive use of antibiotics was also facilitated by a lack of understanding about antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotics usage practices, the nature of the patient-doctor relationship, and demographic characteristics. The findings highlight that to combat antimicrobial resistance due to self-medication, interventions need to focus on interrupting entrenched behavioural responses and addressing emotional responses to perceived health risks.","output":"Self-Medication with Antibiotics for Protection against COVID-19: The Role of Psychological Distress, Knowledge of, and Experiences with Antibiotics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last month of 2019, a new virus called SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 was discovered in Wuhan, China.

This study aimed to investigate the association between insomnia, academic performance, self-reported health, physical activity, school start time, and substance use among adolescents. METHODS: A survey with a cross-sectional design was completed by adolescents (15-17 years old; n = 1504) in southern Sweden. The Minimal Insomnia Symptoms Scale (MISS) was used to operationalize insomnia. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between insomnia and self-reported health, failed school courses, substance use, school start time, family financial situation, screen time, and gender. RESULTS: Insomnia (MISS &#8805; 6) was associated with poor self-reported health (OR: 4.35), failed school courses (OR: 1.47), and use of alcohol and/or cigarettes (OR: 1.43). When the combined effect of self-reported health and physical activity were investigated, a combination of low physical activity (&#8804;1 time/week) and poor self-reported health was strongly associated with insomnia (OR: 18.87).

The latter is a specific nontoxic Ras inhibitor with a mild hydrophobic nature, which can also be used for local cancer treatment and stent applications. The fibers were composed of a dense polyglyconate core and a porous drug-loaded poly(D,L-lactic-glycolic acid) shell, prepared using freeze drying of inverted emulsions. Our study focused on the release profile of the antiproliferative drugs from the fibers, the shell morphology and its degradation and erosion. The postfabrication antiproliferative effect of the drugs was tested in a cell culture. The process parameters were found to affect the drug-release profile via two routes: (1) direct, through water uptake and swelling of the structure leading to FTS release, or through degradation of the host polymer leading to paclitaxel release at a later stage; (2) indirect effect of the microstructure on the release profile. The fabrication process did not reduce the pharmacological activity of either paclitaxel or FTS. FTS-eluting composite fibers proved to effectively induce growth inhibition or cell death by a gradient effect and dose-dependent manner. The combined effect of the targeted mechanism of FTS as a Ras inhibitor together with the localized and controlled release characteristics of the fiber is an advantageous antiproliferative quality.

Neuro-oncological surgery units have peculiar features that make them highly relevant in the strategic reaction to the pandemic. In this Chinese Society of Neuro-Oncology (CSNO) initiated survey, we appraise the changes implemented in neuro-oncological surgery hospitals across different Asian countries and provide expert recommendations for responses at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a 42-question survey of the early experience of neuro-oncological surgery practice in hospitals across different Asian countries on April 1, 2020, with responses closed on April 18, 2020. RESULTS: 144 hospitals completed the questionnaire. Most were in WHO post-peak phase of the pandemic and reported a median reduction in neuro-oncological surgery volume of 25C50%. Most (67.4%) resumed elective surgery in only COVID-19 negative patients;11.1% performed only emergency cases irrespective of COVID-19 status;2.1% suspended all surgical activity. Ninety-one (63.2%) relocated personnel from neurosurgery to other departments. Fifty-two (36.1%) hospitals suspended post-operative adjuvant therapy and 94 (65.2%) instituted different measures to administer post-operative adjuvant therapy. Majority (59.0%) of the hospitals suspended research activity. Most (70%) respondents anticipate that current neurosurgery restrictions will continue to remain for > 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the respondents to our survey reported reduced neuro-oncological surgery activity, policy modification, personnel reallocation, and curtailment of educational/research activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistent widespread interruption of surgical neuro-oncology in even post-peak phases of the pandemic raises serious concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic on neuro-oncological patients and highlights the essence of timely measures for pandemic preparedness, patient triage, and workforce protection.","output":"Impact of a pandemic on surgical neuro-oncologymaintaining functionality in the early phase of crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance projects provide a good measure of transmission and monitor the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants at regional and global scales. Iran is one of the most affected countries still involved with the virus circulating in at least five significant disease waves, as of September 2021. Complete genome sequencing of 50 viral isolates in an early phase of outbreak in Iran, shed light on the origins and circulating lineages at that time. As part of a genomic surveillance program, we provided an additional 319 complete genomes from October 2020 onwards. The current study is the report of complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of Iran in the March 2020-May 2021 time interval. We aimed to characterize the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Iran over one year. Overall, 35 different lineages and 8 clades were detected. Temporal dynamics of the prominent SARS-CoV-2 clades/lineages circulating in Iran is comparable to the global perspective and introduces the 19A clade (B.4) dominating the first disease wave, followed by 20A (B.1.36), 20B (B.1.1.413), 20I (B.1.1.7) clades, dominating second, third and fourth disease waves, respectively. We observed a mixture of circulating 20A (B.1.36), 20B (B.1.1.413), 20I (B.1.1.7) clades in winter 2021, paralleled in a diminishing manner for 20A/20B and a growing rise for 20I, eventually prompting the 4th outbreak peak. Furthermore, our study provides evidence on the entry of the Delta variant in April 2021, leading to the 5th disease wave in summer 2021. Three lineages are highlighted as hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Iran; B4, dominating early periods of the epidemic, B.1.1.413 (specific B.1.1 lineage carrying a combination of [D138Y-S477N-D614G] spike mutations) in October 2020-February 2021, and the co-occurrence of [I100T-L699I] spike mutations in half of B.1.1.7 sequences mediating the fourth peak. Continuous monthly monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genome mutations led to the detection of 1577 distinct nucleotide mutations, in which the top recurrent mutations were D614G, P323L, R203K/G204R, 3037C>T, and 241C>T; the renowned combination of mutations in G and GH clades. The most frequent spike mutation is D614G followed by 13 other frequent mutations based on the prominent circulating lineages; B.1.1.7 (H69_V70del, Y144del, N501Y, A570D, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H, I100T, and L699I), B.1.1.413 (D138Y, S477N) and B.1.36 (I210del).

In other airway diseases, abnormal airway mucus contributes to sustained airway symptoms. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on airway mucus has received limited attention. In the current review, we assess literature describing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on airway pathophysiology with specific emphasis on mucus production. Accumulating evidence suggests that the 2 major secreted airway mucin glycoproteins, MUC5AC and MUC5B, are abnormal in some patients with COVID-19. Aberrations in MUC5AC or MUC5B in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are likely due to inflammation, though the responsible mechanisms have yet to be determined.

DESIGN: The study was conducted in the haor areas of Kishoreganj district in Bangladesh. A cross sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 400 children of aged 5C10 years using semi-structured questionnaire. The outcomes variables considered were stunting, wasting and underweight calculated following the World Health Organization anthropometric guidelines of 2006. Children and their parents socio-demographic characteristics were considered as the exposure variables. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of the respondents. Binary logistic regression model was used to determine the factors associated with the malnutrition. RESULTS: Around half (48%) of the total children analysed were wasted at the time of the survey following around 40.5% were underweight and 38% were stunted. The likelihoods of occurring stunting, wasting and underweight were found higher among female children than their male counterpart. The prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight were 39%, 54% and 45% among girls whereas the prevalence was 36%, 42% and 36% among the boys, respectively. The likelihoods of becoming malnourished were found to be increased with the increase ages of the children, from the ages 5C6 years. Higher the number of children in the family and delay of giving complementary food after six months were also found associated with the higher odds of becoming malnourished. In contrary, increased meal frequency, solvency with land ownership were found associated with the reduced odds of becoming malnourished. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of malnutrition among primary school going children in haor areas of Bangladesh is higher than its other geographical regions. The prevalence is even higher among the female children. Proper nutritional education of parents is important along with the supports for the parents who do not have the capacity to provide nutritional food for their children.

The study explored personal, clinical, and technology factors predicting cancer survivors' electronic communication with clinicians. METHODS: Data for this investigation came from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS5, Cycle 2) that included 593 respondents who previously or currently had cancer. Multivariate regression analyses were used to predict electronic communication with clinicians. Predictors included demographic variables and health status, technology use (online health information-seeking behavior, tracking of health-related data such as using a Fitbit), and quality of past communication experiences with clinicians. RESULTS: In this pre COVID-19 sample, 42 % respondents (N = 252) did not engage in any type of electronic communication (e.g., emailing, texting, data sharing) with providers. In multivariate analyses, predictors of more electronic communication with clinicians included frequency of seeking health-related information online (? = .267, p < .001) and better communication experiences with clinicians (? = .028, p = .034), while no demographic variable showed significance. The technology use variables (online health information seeking, health tracking) were significantly higher predictors of electronic communication with clinicians (&#916;R2 = .142, p < .001) than was past experiences with clinicians (&#916;R2 = .029, p = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Access and past experience with interactive media technologies are strong predictors of cancer patients' electronic communication than with clinicians. Adoption of telehealth technology likely depends as much on patients' relationships with technology as it does their relationships with clinicians.

MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS An anonymous, online survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3 - 24, 2020) included an open-ended prompt asking women to tell us how COVID-19 had affected their prenatal care. Open-ended narrative responses were downloaded into Excel and coded using the Attride-Sterling Framework. 2519 pregnant women from 47 states responded to the survey, 88.4% of whom had at least one previous birth. Mean age was 32.7 years, mean weeks pregnant was 24.3 weeks, and mean number of prenatal visits at the point of the survey was 6.5. Predominant themes of the open narratives included COVID-19's role in creating structural changes within the healthcare system (reported spontaneously by 2075 respondents), behavioral changes among both pregnant women and their providers (reported by 429 respondents), and emotional consequences for women who were pregnant (reported by 503 respondents) during the pandemic. Changes resulting from COVID-19 varied widely by provider, and women's perceptions of the impact on quality of care ranged from perceiving care as extremely compromised to perceiving it to be improved as a result of the pandemic. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Women who are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced enormous upheaval as hospitals and healthcare providers have struggled to meet the simultaneous and often competing demands of infection prevention, pandemic preparedness, high patient volumes of extremely sick patients, and the needs of 'non-urgent' pregnant patients. In some settings, women described very few changes, whereas others reported radical changes implemented seemingly overnight. While infection rates may drive variable responses, these inconsistencies raise important questions regarding the need for local, state, national, or even global recommendations for the care of pregnant women during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on prenatal care in the United States: Qualitative analysis from a survey of 2519 pregnant women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been five Mass Extinction events in the history of Earth's biodiversity, all caused by dramatic but natural phenomena. It has been claimed that the Sixth Mass Extinction may be underway, this time caused entirely by humans. Although considerable evidence indicates that there is a biodiversity crisis of increasing extinctions and plummeting abundances, some do not accept that this amounts to a Sixth Mass Extinction. Often, they use the IUCN Red List to support their stance, arguing that the rate of species loss does not differ from the background rate. However, the Red List is heavily biased: almost all birds and mammals but only a minute fraction of invertebrates have been evaluated against conservation criteria. Incorporating estimates of the true number of invertebrate extinctions leads to the conclusion that the rate vastly exceeds the background rate and that we may indeed be witnessing the start of the Sixth Mass Extinction. As an example, we focus on molluscs, the second largest phylum in numbers of known species, and, extrapolating boldly, estimate that, since around AD 1500, possibly as many as 7.5-13% (150,000-260,000) of all ~2 million known species have already gone extinct, orders of magnitude greater than the 882 (0.04%) on the Red List. We review differences in extinction rates according to realms: marine species face significant threats but, although previous mass extinctions were largely defined by marine invertebrates, there is no evidence that the marine biota has reached the same crisis as the non-marine biota. Island species have suffered far greater rates than continental ones. Plants face similar conservation biases as do invertebrates, although there are hints they may have suffered lower extinction rates. There are also those who do not deny an extinction crisis but accept it as a new trajectory of evolution, because humans are part of the natural world; some even embrace it, with a desire to manipulate it for human benefit. We take issue with these stances. Humans are the only species able to manipulate the Earth on a grand scale, and they have allowed the current crisis to happen. Despite multiple conservation initiatives at various levels, most are not species oriented (certain charismatic vertebrates excepted) and specific actions to protect every living species individually are simply unfeasible because of the tyranny of numbers. As systematic biologists, we encourage the nurturing of the innate human appreciation of biodiversity, but we reaffirm the message that the biodiversity that makes our world so fascinating, beautiful and functional is vanishing unnoticed at an unprecedented rate. In the face of a mounting crisis, scientists must adopt the practices of preventive archaeology, and collect and document as many species as possible before they disappear. All this depends on reviving the venerable study of natural history and taxonomy. Denying the crisis, simply accepting it and doing nothing, or even embracing it for the ostensible benefit of humanity, are not appropriate options and pave the way for the Earth to continue on its sad trajectory towards a Sixth Mass Extinction.","output":"The Sixth Mass Extinction: fact, fiction or speculation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impacts of violence on the health of women and their sons and daughters are significant.

Dwindling supplies, such as face masks, gowns and goggles, and inadequate production to meet increasing demand have placed health care workers and patients at risk. The momentum of the #GetMePPE Twitter hashtag resulted in the creation of a petition to urge public officials to address the PPE shortage through increased funding and production. Simultaneously, the GetUsPPE.org website was launched through the collaboration of physicians and software engineers to develop a digital platform for the donation, request, and distribution of multi-modal sources of PPE. GetUsPPE.org and #GetMePPE were merged in an attempt to combine public engagement and advocacy on social media with the coordination of PPE donation and distribution. Within 10 days, over 1800 hospitals and PPE suppliers were registered in a database that enabled the rapid coordination and distribution of scarce and in-demand materials. One month after its launch, the organization had distributed hundreds of thousands of PPE items and had built a database of over 6000 PPE requesters. The call for action on social media and the rapid development of this digital tool created a productive channel for the public to contribute to the health care response to COVID-19 in meaningful ways. #GetMePPE and GetUsPPE.org were able to mobilize individuals and organizations outside of the health care system to address the unmet needs of the medical community.

However, there is a lack of research on its polyphenols which are of good research value due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and other activities. RESULTS: In this study, the effects of different extraction conditions on the yield of its polyphenols were investigated. Deep-Eutectic Solvents composed of choline chloride and malonic acid had the best extraction efficiency, with the optimal extraction conditions being as follows: a solidCliquid ratio of 40 mg/mL, an extraction temperature of 55 C, an extraction time of 70 min and a DES with 20% water content. Under these conditions, the extraction yield of polyphenols reached 22.09 mg/g which was about 2 times that of alcohol-based extraction (10.95 mg/g). In vitro antioxidant test results further showed that polyphenols from A. cinnamomea had strong antioxidant activities. When the concentration of polyphenols reached 0.1 mg/mL of polyphenols, the scavenging activity of free radical basically reached its maximum, with values of 94.10%, 83.34% and 95.42% for DPPH, ABTS(+) and OH scavenging.

In this review, we provide an overview regarding the molecular profile of the Omicron variant, epidemiology, transmissibility, the impact on vaccines, as well as vaccine escape, and finally, we report the pharmacological agents able to block the endocellular entry of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 or to inhibit its viral replication. The Omicron has more than 50 mutations, of which the spike protein has 26C35 amino acids different from the original SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus or the Delta, some of which are associated with humoral immune escape potential and greater transmissibility. Omicron has a significant growth advantage over Delta, leading to rapid spread with higher incidence levels. The disease so far has been mild compared to the Delta. The two vaccination doses offer little or no protection against Omicron infection while the booster doses provide significant protection against mild illness and likely offer even greater levels of protection against serious illness.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Psychiatric disorders are the main risk factors for suicide. COVID-19 may result in the appearance of neuropsychiatric syndromes. Moreover, other corollaries of the pandemic (e.g., isolation, job loss) may lead to increasing stress and, ultimately, psychiatric disorders even among the non-infected population. OBJECTIVE We aimed to test the theory of whether the pandemic, due to the aforementioned factors, was associated with the reversal of the declining suicide rate trend in Hungary. METHOD To compare the observed number of suicides during the COVID-19 months (March-December 2020) with the expected numbers, we used an interrupted time series model and, for the estimations, quasi-Poisson regression. Expected numbers were calculated based on trends derived from monthly data between 2010 and 2020. RESULTS During the months of the pandemic, the number of suicides among males rose significantly by 18% compared to the hypothetical trend that would have occurred in the absence of COVID-19. A significant increase (16%) was also observed in the total population. By contrast, the number of female suicides did not differ significantly from the number expected based on the pre-COVID-19 trend. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION After the outbreak of the epidemic, Hungarian males committed significantly more suicides, while no relevant changes were observed among females. Interestingly, studies from other countries found either no change or decrease when comparing suicide numbers from the COVID-19 period with the corresponding numbers from the pre-COVID-19 period. The explanation for this discrepancy is still lacking, so further investigations are needed.

This provided a unique opportunity to isolate the effects from emission and meteorology on tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)). Comparing the atmospheric NO(2) in 2020 to 2017, we found the changes of emission have led to a -49.3  23.5% reduction, which was 12% more than satellite observed reduction of -37.8  16.3%.

The present study summarises data from the first 2 weeks of the study. METHODS: COVED is an ongoing prospective cohort study that commenced on 1 April 2020. It includes all adult patients presenting to a participating ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Data are collected prospectively and entered into a bespoke registry. Outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result and requirement for intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-14 April 2020, 240 (16%) of 1508 patients presenting to The Alfred Emergency and Trauma Centre met inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean age of patients was 60 years and the commonest symptoms were acute shortness of breath (n = 122 [67%]), cough (n = 108 [56%]) or fever (n = 98 [51%]). Overseas travel or known contact with a confirmed case was reported by 24 (14%) and 16 (10%) patients, respectively. Fever or hypoxia was recorded in 23 (10%) and 11 (5%) patients, respectively. Eleven (5%) patients received mechanical ventilation in the ED, of whom none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients presenting to a tertiary ED with suspected COVID-19, only a small proportion tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware.

Given that the highest viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is found in the airway, otolaryngologists are at high risk of infection. As a result, multiple recommendations have emerged regarding protective measures for surgical teams, including suspending non-urgent procedures and surgeries. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngology residency training programs nationwide. Methods A cross-sectional survey-based study was completed in April 2020. The participants were recruited through an online survey, sent by email to all Chilean otolaryngology residents. Demographics, clinical activities, on-call shifts, COVID-19 infection status, exposure to COVID-19 patients, deployment to other specialties, diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, and surgeries performed were analyzed. Self-reported surgical data logs from previous years were used to compare results. Results Forty-seven residents completed the survey (84% response rate); 64% of residents refer seeing patients ten days or less during April 2020. Commonly performed procedures such as flexible nasolaryngoscopy, rigid nasal endoscopy, and peritonsillar abscess drainage were not performed by over 40% of the residents in that month. Only 38% participated in surgeries, with an average of 0.6 surgeries as a first surgeon, a dramatic decrease in surgical exposure when comparing the data logs from previous years. Most residents refer the following measures taken by their residency program to improve residency training: bibliographic videoconferences (87%), online clinical case seminars (60%), weekly journal clubs (38%), among others. Conclusions Clinical and surgical opportunities decreased dramatically during April 2020.

However, pelvic floor imaging after surgery has not been reported. OBJECTIVE This study was designed to assess the outcome of patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for rectoanal intussusception, with special reference to the postoperative findings on evacuation proctography. DESIGN This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING The study was conducted from 2012 to 2013 at the Department of Surgery, Kameda Medical Center, Japan. PATIENTS We included 26 patients with symptomatic rectoanal intussusception. INTERVENTION Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Evacuation proctography was performed before and 6 months after the procedure. Defecatory function was evaluated using the Constipation Scoring System and Fecal Incontinence Severity Index. RESULTS Of 26 patients with rectoanal intussusception preoperatively, 22 had symptoms of obstructed defecation and 21 complained of fecal incontinence. Postoperatively, rectoanal intussusception was eliminated in all patients, though 8 developed recto rectal intussusception. There was an overall reduction in both grade 2 rectocele size (median preop 26 mm vs. postop 11 mm; p < 0.0001) and pelvic floor descent (median preop 26 mm vs. postop 20 mm; p < 0.0001). 6 months after surgery, a reduction of at least 50% was observed in the Constipation Scoring System score for 9 patients (41%) with obstructive defecation and in the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score for 14 incontinent patients (67%). LIMITATIONS This was a preliminary study with a small sample size, no control group, and short follow-up time. CONCLUSION Evacuation proctography showed anatomical correction in patients with rectoanal intussusception who underwent laparoscopic ventral rectopexy.

Students could either watch the classes live and ask the teacher questions via an online chat, or alternatively, they could watch the pre-recorded classes at a later time. The two options were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. Results showed a continuous decrease in the number of students who preferred the first option, switching progressively from online live classes to pre-recorded classes as the weeks passed.

X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) quantified fluvial and marine elemental concentrations (Cl, Sr, Ca, Mn, K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Zr, Br). Palynology-based agglomerate hierarchical analysis of thirty-two pollen taxa was employed to define ecological clusters. The implementation of multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) to geochemical and ecological variables inferred the source of sedimentary material by correlating four taxonomic groups (floodplain trees, upland trees, tidal freshwater herbs, and inland herbs) to specific geochemical signatures and facilitated the testing of potential correlations between geo- and hydrological-conditions and the six ecosystems (interdistributary, delta-plain, deltaic lake, bottomland and swamp forests, freshwater marsh, and intermediate marsh) depicted in each PCA biplot.

In the UK Biobank study, 502,650 participants entered the cohort from 2006 to 2010, and were followed up until 2019 to identify disease incidence via linkage to the patient registers. For those diseases with increased risk among women, conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs), and the binomial test of direction was further used to build disease trajectories. Among 301 diseases, 82 diseases in women had ORs > 1.2 and p < 0.00017 when compared to men, involving mainly diseases in the endocrine, skeletal and digestive systems. Diseases with the highest ORs included breast diseases, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and deformity of the toes. The biomarker and disease trajectories suggested estradiol as a risk predictor for breast cancer, while a high percentage of reticulocyte, body mass index and waist circumference were associated with an increased risk of upper-limb neuropathy.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how medical doctors in the outpatient clinic use and experience the use of video consultations with hematological patients, with a focus on relational and organizational aspects. METHODS: The study was designed as an explorative and qualitative study. Data were collected via participant observations and focus group interviews with medical doctors. RESULTS: The study identified possibilities and barriers in relation to adapting to the alternative way of meeting patients in the clinical setting. One of the main findings in this study is that the medical doctors were afraid that they missed important observations, as they were not able to perform a physical examination, if needed. They also emphasized that handshake and eye contact were important in order to get an overall impression of the patients situation. It also became clear that the medical doctors used body language a lot more during video consultation compared with consultation in a physical setting. The medical doctors found the contact with the patients via the screen to be good, and the fact that the technology was working well made them feel comfortable with the video consultation.

We estimated the rate of COVID\\\\19 among RA participants and compared it with that of the general population. METHODS: Using the Health Improvement Network, we identified RA patients before February 2020 and followed them to September 2020. We calculated the rate of COVID\\\\19 among participants with RA and compared it with that of the general population using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for potential confounders using overlap weighting of exposure score. We repeated the same analysis among participants with osteoarthritis, a nonautoimmune rheumatic disease, as a negative control exposure. RESULTS: We identified 225 cases of suspected and confirmed COVID\\\\19 among 17,268 RA patients, and 14,234 cases among 1,616,600 participants in the general population (1.4 versus 0.9/1,000 person\\\\months), with the adjusted hazard ratio (HR(adj)) being 1.19 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.04C1.36).

It allows the transfer of information between physical and digital data, with the significant advantage of easing the transition process and increasing efficiency. Digital technology is a crucial component of modern dentistry which has a significant influence on our present and future dental practice. Aim: To assess the knowledge, awareness and practices of the use of digital technology and its implications in dentistry among dental postgraduate students and dental practitioners. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire based online survey was undertaken at KLE VK Institute of Dental Sciences, Belagavi, Karnataka, India between April 2021 and July 2021 amongst dental practitioners and dental postgraduate students of different regions across India. The questionnaire consisted of 21 questions which evaluated their awareness towards digital dentistry, its advantages and shortcomings, their knowledge and practices towards digital dentistry. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test in each group, using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. The p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Of total 270, 261 respondents (96.67%) were aware of CAD/CAM technology in dentistry. A total of 237 respondents (87.78%) felt that the lack of knowledge was one of the shortcomings of CAD/CAM with a p-value=0.039 rather than its high cost (184 respondents 68.15%, p-value=0.009) and there was a need to increase the knowledge and understanding regarding the same. A total of 252 respondents (93.33%) were of the opinion that digital technology is the future of dentistry and it will have a positive impact on our profession and 83.59 % respondents felt that digital technology would have a role to play in the current COVID-19 scenario. The teaching faculty (92.86%), showed better understanding about the digital technology compared to private practitioners (66.22%) and postgraduate students (62.59%). Conclusion: In the given set of participants, most of the participants were aware about digital technology which shows a satisfactory outcome. The teaching faculty showed better understanding about the digital technology compared to private practitioners and postgraduate students. However, to make them acquainted with CAD/CAM, dental education programmes and workshops should be conducted which will create a future generation of dentists who will be well versed with digital dentistry. With so much room to grow, it will help dentists to work as one and deliver the absolute best care to their patients and create a better tomorrow.","output":"Knowledge, Awareness and Practices of the use of Digital Technology in Dentistry among Postgraduate Students and Dental Practitioners in India: A Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the relationship between a number of socioeconomic, demographic, and political variables and county-level measures of social mobility in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

Methods: : We reviewed the clinical documentation of six consecutive COVID-19 patients with primary spinal epidural abscess that we had to surgically manage during a two-month period. These cases were analyzed for what concerns both the viral infection and the spinal abscess. Results: : Abscess was primary in all cases meaning that no evident infective source was found. Primary abscess represents the rarest form of spinal epidural abscess, which is usually secondary to invasive procedures or spreading from adjacent infective sites, such as spondylodiscitis and generally occurs in patients with diabetes, obesity, cancer, or other chronic disease. In all cases, there was mild lymphopenia but the spinal abscess occurred regardless the severity of the viral disease, the immunologic state, and the presence of bacteremia. Obesity was the only risk factor and was reported just in two patients. All patients but one were hypertensive. The preferred localizations were cervical and thoracic, whereas the classic abscess generally occurs at lumbar level. No patient had history of pyogenic infection, even though previous asymptomatic bacterial contaminations were reported in three cases. Conclusion: We wonder about the concentration of this uncommon disease in a so short period. To our knowledge, cases of epidural spinal abscess in COVID-19 patients have been not yet reported. Accordingly, we ignore if the SARS-Corona Virus-2 may really predispose to spinal epidural abscesses. However, we hypothesize that, in our patients, the spinal infection could have depended on the coexistence of an initially asymptomatic bacterial contamination. The well-known COVID-19-related endotheliitis might have created the conditions for retrograde bacterial invasion of the correspondent spinal epidural space. Anyway, the spinal epidural abscess carries significantly high morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to diagnose, especially in compromised COVID-19 patients but it should be kept in mind because early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.","output":"Spinal Epidural Abscess in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bullae autoimmune diseases can be induced by environmental factors in a genetically susceptible individual, and viruses may be important triggers for this process. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multisystemic disease known for developing many types of skin lesions. However, little is known about post-COVID-19 manifestations. A previous healthy male patient, 43 years old, with resistant mediastinal Hodgkin's lymphoma stage II diagnosed in 2019, without treatment at the moment, developed monomorphic flaccid bullae on the trunk 40 days after testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although he had risk factors for IgA and paraneoplastic pemphigus, there were no elements for these diseases. The investigation confirmed a pemphigus vulgaris (PV). PV had a good response to treatment with prednisolone 1 mg/kg per day, and methotrexate 15 mg subcutaneously was added per week. The patient was discharged with oral methotrexate and prednisolone at the same dose. Prednisolone was decreased by 20 mg per day during the follow-up. Viruses such as herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, and varicela zoster can act as triggers for PV. This process is not immediate after the infection because it depends on the change in antibodies initially produced against the virus that start to identify antigens present in the skin's anchoring structures. SARS-CoV-2 can induce autoimmunity, as seen in Guilln-Barr syndrome and in Kawasaki disease. It is a highly immunogenic virus that is the perfect agent for triggering PV.

A serological survey was done at some of these locations to assess the COVID-19 exposure prevalence in this group. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional seroprevalence study at food distribution sites, emergency shelters, and workers' residences that were provided medical services by Mdecins Sans Frontires in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis in the Ile-de-France region. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seropositivity was detected by Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Pseudo Neutralization Test. Sociodemographic and exposure related information was collected via a verbal questionnaire to analyse risk factors and associations with various COVID-19 symptoms. FINDINGS: Between June 23 and July 2, 2020, 426 (52%) of 818 individuals recruited tested positive in 14 sites. Seroprevalence varied significantly by type of recruitment site (&#967;2 p<00001), being highest among those living in workers' residences (887%, 95% CI 818-932), followed by emergency shelters (505%, 463-547), and food distribution sites (278%, 208-357). More than two thirds of COVID-19 seropositive individuals (68%, 95% CI 642-722; 291 of 426) did not report any symptoms during the recall period. COVID-19 seropositivity was strongly associated with overcrowding (medium density: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 27, 95% CI 15-51, p=00020; high density: aOR 34, 17-69, p<00001). INTERPRETATION: These results show high exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with important variations between those at different study sites. Living in crowded conditions was the strongest factor associated with exposure level.

Such restrictions on mobility interrupted the normal functioning of agricultural value chains. For a sample of 1767 tomato and wheat producers in the state of Haryana, we study to what extent the lockdown limited access to inputs, labor, machinery, and markets to produce, harvest, and sell their crops. We quantify crop income reductions during the first months of the lockdown and analyze to what extent these are associated with borrowing and food insecurity. We find that wheat producers, for whom state\\\\led procurement guaranteed market access at fixed prices, suffered minimal declines in income. For tomato producersan already more vulnerable populationincome fell by 50% relative to their expected income in a normal year, largely due to a steep fall of tomato prices as they shifted from wholesale markets to local retail markets, resulting in a sharp increase in local supply. Relative to wheat producers affected by the lockdown, reduced income for tomato producers was associated with an increase in borrowing and reduced food security. We conclude that targeting producers of crops that face substantial price risk and introducing policies that stabilize market prices are important in efforts to aid recovery and build resilience of smallholder farmers.","output":"Crop prices, farm incomes, and food security during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in India: Phone\\\\based producer survey evidence from Haryana State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate members perceptions of the therapeutic factors during a group intervention that was designed to mitigate the adverse psychological effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the imposition of restrictive measures, their satisfaction with the online format of the intervention, and how these are associated with the interventions outcomes.

To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, 1 week before and 1 week after implementation, participants completed several questionnaires measuring their demographic characteristics, empathy, resilience, affectivity, feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety levels, and feelings of fear regarding the outbreak. One week after the intervention, they also completed two questionnaires evaluating the therapeutic factors and their satisfaction and impressions regarding telemental health counseling. Analyses showed that the most frequently cited therapeutic factor was guidance, followed by acceptance, self-disclosure, universality, and instillation of hope. Therapeutic factors of catharsis, self-disclosure, guidance, self-understanding, vicarious learning, and therapeutic alliance correlated with elements of empathy, resilience, loneliness, positive emotions, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and fear of the coronavirus. Satisfaction with the online format of the intervention was associated to universality, elements of empathy, and symptoms of depression. More specifically, member satisfaction was negatively correlated with improvement in personal distress and depression, an unexpected finding that may be attributed to the brief duration of the present intervention.

Such skills are achieved through supervised examination of patients often supported by simulator-based learning. The emergence of COVID-19 has disrupted and continues to hinder hands-on on-site medical training on a global scale. Project description: An effective virtual auscultation course was established in times of contact restrictions due to COVID-19 at the Medical Faculty of the Heinrich Heine University Dsseldorf. The interactive case-based webinar was designed to improve listening techniques, description and interpretation of auscultation findings in an off-site context. Clinical cases with pre-recorded auscultation sounds and additional case-based diagnostics were presented. The course focused on common heart murmurs including aortic and mitral valve stenosis and regurgitation as well as congenital heart defects (ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus). Results: The course was well received by the students and assessed as being useful and instructive. Assessment of learning effects, such as detection of pathological findings before and after training, is ongoing as part of a subsequent trial. Conclusion: Virtual interactive learning using a sound simulation lesson with clinical case presentations via video chat can well be used as a supplement to practical auscultation training. This learning format could also play a useful role in the curriculum of medical studies once contact restrictions are revoked.","output":"Virtual auscultation course for medical students via video chat in times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Diarrhoeal diseases are among the most important health problems in the world today.

Both patients tolerated the treatment without side effects for 7 and 2 months, respectively. After an upper respiratory tract infection in Patient 1 and a first COVID-19 vaccination in Patient 2, both patients suddenly developed ISR with erythema, calor, and itching upon 2 (Patient 1) and 1 (Patient 2) subsequent injection(s), respectively. Symptoms resolved with local steroids, oral antihistamines, and cooling. After termination of the presumed immune system activated state, alirocumab was well tolerated again in both patients without recurrence of any ISR upon repeated applications. DISCUSSION: These are the first cases to report transient ISR to a PCSK9 inhibitor, possibly triggered by activation of the immune system, after prolonged good tolerability. Based on the transient and benign nature of the reaction, such patients should be encouraged to continue supervised treatment, as tolerability may return after resolution of the pro-inflammatory state.","output":"Transient injection site reaction to alirocumab during immune system activation: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Descrever a frequncia da procura da Profilaxia Ps-Exposio n?o ocupacional (nPEP), tanto ao longo da pandemia de COVID-19 no ano de 2020 quanto no mesmo perodo do ano anterior, e a situao da perda de acompanhamentos de indivduos expostos iniciados  nPEP em um determinado servi?o de sade nestes mesmos perodos.

More recent studies have questioned its safety and efficacy and, until stronger evidence is available, it was suspended from therapy protocols.We describe our experience treating COVID-19 Portuguese pediatric patients with hydroxychloroquine, having applied a protocol for monitoring cardiac toxicity. Methods: An observational retrospective study of COVID-19 pediatric patients, admitted from March to April 2020 and treated with hydroxychloroquine. Cardiotoxicity was assessed using ECG recordings and corrected QT-time (QTc). Patients were classified into risk-groups depending on QTc value: normal, slightly elevated or severely elevated (>500 ms). Results: Total of 14 patients, with a median age of 10 years [four months; 17 years], treated with hydroxychloroquine for a median of five days. Hydroxychloroquine was used in monotherapy in six patients (mainly mild disease with comorbidities), and in association with lopinavir/ritonavir3 and azithromycin5 in moderate to severe disease. Other QT-prolonging therapies were used in five patients: oseltamivir (3), omeprazole (1), morphine (1) and ketamine (1).At 48 hours of treatment, two patients temporarily suspended hydroxychloroquine due to QTc prolongation (>500 ms). All patients completed the whole treatment. No other side effects or deaths occurred. Conclusion: Clinical trials are evolving to define hydroxychloroquine effectivity and safety. Our considerable pediatric population supports the need for cardiotoxicity monitoring during therapy but suggest its use seems to be safe in COVID-19 pediatric patients, even in association with other QT-prolonging therapies.","output":"Protocol-based cardiotoxicity monitoring in hydroxychloroquine medicated COVID-19 pediatric patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) &#x2014;including Machine Learning (ML) and Big Data analytics &#x2014;as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic This paper provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research First, four areas where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely, i) tracking and tracing, ii) Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) by Wearable IoT (WIoT), iii) Personal Digital Twins (PDT), and iv) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in Korea Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: i) diagnosis and prognosis, ii) risk prediction, iii) vaccine and drug development, iv) research dataset, v) early warnings and alerts, vi) social control and fake news detection, and vii) communication and chatbot Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including i) crowd surveillance, ii) public announcements, iii) screening and diagnosis, and iv) essential supply delivery Finally, we discuss how Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19 IEEE","output":"Harnessing the Power of Smart and Connected Health to Tackle COVID-19: IoT, AI, Robotics, and Blockchain for a Better World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A substantial portion of human respiratory tract infection is thought to be transmitted via contaminated hand contact with the mouth, eyes, and/or nostrils. Thus, a key risk factor for infection transmission should be the rate of hand contact with these areas termed target facial membranes.

The number of contacts to the eyes, nostrils, and lips was scored during subsequent viewing of the tapes. The total contacts per subject had sample mean x = 47 and sample standard deviation s = 34. The average total contact rate per hour was 15.7. The authors developed a relatively simple algebraic model for estimating the dose of pathogens transferred to target facial membranes during a defined exposure period. The model considers the rate of pathogen transfer to the hands via contact with contaminated environmental surfaces, and the rate of pathogen loss from the hands due to pathogen die-off and transfer from the hands to environmental surfaces and to target facial membranes during touching. The estimation of infection risk due to this dose also is discussed.

AIM: To assess the effectiveness of a targeted postal intervention (to promote awareness of cancer symptoms and earlier help seeking) on patient consultation rates. DESIGN AND SETTING: A two-arm randomised controlled trial was carried out on patients aged 50C84 years registered at 23 general practices in rural and urban areas of Greater London, Greater Manchester, and the North East of England. METHOD: Patients who had not had a consultation at their general practice in the previous 12 months and had at least two other risk factors for late presentation with cancer were randomised to intervention and control arms. The intervention consisted of a posted letter and leaflet. Primary outcome was the number of consultations at the practice with patients randomised to each arm in the 6 months subsequent to posting the intervention. All patients with outcome data were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. RESULTS: In total, 1513 patients were individually randomised to the intervention (n = 783) and control (n = 730) arms between Nov 2016  May 2017; outcome data were available for 749 and 705 patients, respectively, with a statistically significantly higher rate of consultation in the intervention arm compared with the control arm: 436 versus 335 consultations (relative risk 1.40, 95% confidence interval = 1.11 to 1.77, P = 0.004). There was, however, no difference in the numbers of patients consulting. CONCLUSION: Targeted interventions of this nature can change behaviour; there is a need to develop interventions that can be more effective at engaging patients with primary care.

There is a need to develop and test interventions that can be more effective at engaging the most at-risk patients.","output":"Targeted encouragement of GP consultations for possible cancer symptoms: a randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The majority of American adults search for health and illness information on the internet. However, the quality and accuracy of this information are notoriously variable. With the advent of social media, US individuals have increasingly shared their own health and illness experiences, including those related to bariatric surgery, on social media platforms. Previous research has found that peer-to-peer requesting and giving of advice related to bariatric surgery on social media is common, that such advice is often presented in stark terms, and that the advice may not reflect patient standards of care. These previous investigations have helped to map bariatric surgery content on Facebook and YouTube. OBJECTIVE: This objective of this study was to document and compare weight loss surgery (WLS)Crelated content on Instagram in the months leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic and 1 year later. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 300 Instagram posts (50 posts per week for 3 consecutive weeks in late February and early March in both 2020 and 2021) uploaded using the hashtag #wls. Descriptive statistics were reported, and independent 1-tailed chi-square tests were used to determine if a posts publication year statistically affected its inclusion of a particular type of content. RESULTS: Overall, advice giving and personal responsibility for outcomes were emphasized by WLS posters on Instagram. However, social support was less emphasized. The safety, challenges, and risks associated with WLS were rarely discussed. The majority of posts did not contain references to facts from reputable medical sources. Posts published in 2021 were more likely to mention stress/hardships of living with WLS (45/150, 30%, vs 29/150, 19.3%; P=.03); however, those published in 2020 more often identified the importance of ongoing support for WLS success (35/150, 23.3%, vs 16/150, 10.7%; P=.004). CONCLUSIONS: Given that bariatric patients have low rates of postoperative follow-up, yet post-operative care and yet support are associated with improved health and weight loss outcomes, and given that health content on the web is of mixed accuracy, bariatric professionals may wish to consider including an online support forum moderated by a professional as a routine part of postoperative care.

Outcomes included clinical success, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, contrast use and radiation exposure. RESULTS: Theauthors included 5 studies comprising 1555 patients in this meta-analysis. Clinical success was comparable in both arms (p = 0.91). Procedure time was significantly longer in RCPCI group (risk ratio: 5.52, 95% confidence interval: 1.85 to 9.91, p = 0.003). Compared to SCPCI, patients in RCPCI group had lower contrast use (meandifference: ?19.88, 95% confidence interval: ?21.43 to ?18.33, p < 0.001), fluoroscopy time (mean difference:-1.82, 95% confidence interval: ?3.64 to ?0.00, p = 0.05) and radiation exposure (mean difference:-457.8, 95% confidence interval: ?707.14 to ?208.14, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RCPCI can achieve similar success as SCPCI at the expense of longer procedural times. However, radiation exposure and contrast exposure were lower in the RCPCI arm.","output":"Safety and feasibility of robotic assisted percutaneous coronary intervention compared to standard percutaneous coronary intervention- a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a severe complication of infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that cause serious damage to public health. Currently, no effective therapeutic strategy exists for CRS treatment in clinic, and supportive therapy is still the main method. Here, we show the potential of macrophage membrane-biomimetic nanoparticles for CRS treatment. By fusing macrophage membrane on the surface of the PLGA skeleton, we constructed biomimetic nanoparticles that inherited the membrane receptors from the \\"parental\\" macrophages, enabling the neutralization of CRS-related cytokines. We compared three types of macrophage membranes to screen out more effective biomimetic nanoparticles for CRS treatment. Our results show that biomimetic nanoparticles containing M0 macrophage membrane can decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in CRS to the greatest extent. In a mouse model of RNA virus analog-induced CRS, the macrophage membrane-biomimetic nanoparticles manifested significant therapeutic efficacy by reducing cytokine levels and alleviating organ damage.Funding Information: This work was supported by Scientific Research Project of Tongji University (22120200021), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82073385 and 81803078), Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (20DZ2255200 and 21140901900).Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: All animal studies were approved under the guidelines of Tongji University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.","output":"Therapeutic Effect of Macrophage-Derived Biomimetic Nanoparticles for Cytokine Release Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed several challenges to the provision of newborn nutrition and care interventions including maternal support, breastfeeding and family participatory care. Italy was the first country to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in Europe. One of the measures adopted by the Italian government during COVID-19 pandemic was the total lockdown of the cities with complete confinement at home. We aimed to examine the impact of the lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic on exclusive breastfeeding in non-infected mothers. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 204 mother-baby dyads during lockdown (9 March to 8 May 2020) that we compared to previously studied 306 mother-baby dyads admitted during the year 2018. To reduce the possible effect of confounding factors on exclusive breastfeeding, a 1:1 matching was performed by using an automatized procedure of stratification that paired 173 mother-baby dyads. Feeding modality was collected at discharge, 30 and 90 days of newborns life. Exclusive breastfeeding was considered when the infant received only breast milk and no other liquids or solids were given with the exception of vitamins, minerals or medicines. RESULTS: At discharge 69.4% of infants were exclusively breastfed during lockdown versus 97.7% of control group, 54.3% at 30 days vs 76.3 and 31.8% vs 70.5% at 90 days (p < 0.001). The proportion of breastfeeding remaining exclusive from discharge to 30-day was similar between groups (about 80%), but it was lower in lockdown group than in control cohort (58.5% vs 92.4%, p < 0.001) from 30- to 90-days. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown and home confinement led to a decrease of exclusively breastfeeding in the studied population. Considering the timing to shift from exclusive to non-exclusive breastfeeding, differences between study groups were concentrated during hospital stay and from 30- to 90 days of a newborns life, confirming that the hospital stay period is crucial in continuing exclusive breastfeeding at least for the first 30 days, but no longer relevant at 90 days of life.

Therefore, the development of new antibiotics that inhibit novel targets is of great urgency. Some of the most successful antibiotics inhibit RNA transcription, RNA translation, and DNA replication. Transcription and translation are inhibited by directly targeting the RNA polymerase or ribosome, respectively. DNA replication, in contrast, is inhibited indirectly through targeting of DNA gyrases, and there are currently no antibiotics that inhibit DNA replication by directly targeting the replisome. This contrasts with antiviral therapies where the viral replicases are extensively targeted. In the last two decades there has been a steady increase in the number of compounds that target the bacterial replisome. In particular a variety of inhibitors of the bacterial replicative polymerases PolC and DnaE have been described, with one of the DNA polymerase inhibitors entering clinical trials for the first time.

Our main objective was to identify miRNAs involved in the endothelial function and determine their expression in post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory injuries and thrombotic events. Based on functional enrichment analysis, miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-34a-5p were identified as regulators of mRNA targets involved in endothelial, and inflammatory signaling pathways as well as in viral diseases. A miRNA/mRNA network, constructed based on protein-protein interactions of the miRNA targets and the inflammatory biomarkers characterized in the patients, revealed a close interconnection of these miRNAs with relevance to the endothelial activation/dysfunction. Reduced expression levels of selected miRNAs were observed in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients (n=9) compared to the Controls (n=10)(P<0.01-0.0001).

The United Kingdom has enjoyed a national health service with access based on clinical need, and not ability to pay for over 70 years. This has provided several important benefits including protection against the financial consequences of ill-health, redistribution of wealth from rich to poor, and relatively low administrative costs. Despite this, the United Kingdom continues to lag behind many other comparable high-income countries in key measures including life expectancy, infant mortality and cancer survival. Total health spending in the United Kingdom is slightly above the average for Europe, but it is below many other comparable high-income countries such as Germany, France and Canada. The United Kingdom also has relatively lower levels of doctors, nurses, hospital beds and equipment than many other comparable high-income countries. Wider social determinants of health also contribute to poor outcomes, and the United Kingdom has one of the highest levels of income inequality in Europe. Devolution of responsibility for health care services since the late 1990s to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has resulted in divergence in policies between countries, including in prescription charges, and eligibility for publicly funded social care services. However, more commonalities than differences remain between these health care systems. The United Kingdom initially experienced one of the highest death rates associated with COVID-19; however, the success and speed of the United Kingdom's vaccination programme has since improved the United Kingdom's performance in this respect. Principal health reforms in each country are focusing on facilitating cross-sectoral partnerships and promoting integration of services in a manner that improves the health and well-being of local populations. These include the establishment of integrated care systems in England, integrated joint boards in Scotland, regional partnership boards in Wales and integrated partnership boards in Northern Ireland. Policies are also being developed to align the social care funding model closer to the National Health Service funding model. These include a cap on costs over an individual's lifetime in England, and a national care service free at the point of need in Scotland and Wales.

Leonurine (LEO), isolated from Leonurus japonicus Houtt, showes a crucial role in anticoagulation and vasodilatation. However, the properties and therapeutic mechanisms of this effect have not yet been systematically elucidated. Therefore, the antithrombotic effect of LEO was investigated in this study. Hematoxylin-Eosin staining was used to detect the thrombosis of zebrafish tail. Fluorescence probe was used to detect the reactive oxygen species. The biochemical indexes related to oxidative stress (lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione) and vasodilator factor (endothelin-1 and nitric oxide) were analyzed by specific commercial assay kits. Besides, we detected the expression of related genes (fga, fgb, fgg, pkc, pkc, vwf, f2) and proteins (PI3K, phospho-PI3K, Akt, phospho-Akt, ERK, phospho-ERK FIB) related to the anticoagulation and fibrinolytic system by quantitative reverse transcription and western blot. Beyond that, metabolomic analyses were carried out to identify the expressions of metabolites associated with the anti-thrombosis mechanism of LEO. Our in vivo experimental results showed that LEO could improve the oxidative stress injury, abnormal platelet aggregation and coagulation dysfunction induced by adrenalin hydrochloride. Moreover, LEO restored the modulation of amino acids and inositol metabolites which are reported to alleviate the thrombus formation. Collectively, LEO attenuates adrenalin hydrochloride-induced thrombosis partly via modulating oxidative stress, coagulation cascade and platelet activation and amino acid and inositol metabolites.","output":"Identification of the Antithrombotic Mechanism of Leonurine in Adrenalin Hydrochloride-Induced Thrombosis in Zebrafish via Regulating Oxidative Stress and Coagulation Cascade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is currently the major challenge to global public health. Two proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro or Mpro), are indispensable for SARS-CoV-2 replication, making them attractive targets for antiviral therapy development. Here we screened a panel of essential metal ions using a proteolytic assay and identified that zinc gluconate, a widely-used zinc supplement, strongly inhibited the proteolytic activities of the two proteases in vitro. Biochemical and crystallographic data reveal that zinc gluconate exhibited the inhibitory function via binding to the protease catalytic site residues. We further show that treatment of zinc gluconate in combination with a small molecule ionophore hinokitiol, could lead to elevated intracellular Zn(2+) level and thereby significantly impaired the two protease activities in cellulo. Particularly, this approach could also be applied to rescue SARS-CoV-2 infected mammalian cells, indicative of potential application to combat coronavirus infections. Our studies provide the direct experimental evidence that elevated intracellular zinc concentration directly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest the potential benefits to use the zinc supplements for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment.","output":"Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by zinc gluconate in combination with hinokitiol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of various autoimmune diseases has been reported after COVID-19 infections or vaccinations.

In this patient, antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected both before and after the HSCT. After the patient's hematopoietic stem cells were replaced through HSCT, his AA improved despite the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this case, antibodies derived from the COVID-19 vaccine may not have been directly involved in the development of AA.

Here, we address a significant knowledge gap by comparing transmission dynamics on temporal multipartite networks and on their time-aggregated unipartite projections to determine the impact of the lost information on our ability to predict the systems' dynamics. We show that the dynamics of transmission models can be dramatically dissimilar on multipartite networks and on their projections at three levels: final outcome, the magnitude of the variability from realization to realization, and overall shape of the temporal trajectory. We find that the ratio of the number of nodes to the number of active edges over the time aggregation scale determines the ability of projected networks to capture the dynamics on the multipartite network. Finally, we explore which properties of a multipartite network are crucial in generating synthetic networks that better reproduce the dynamical behavior observed in real multipartite networks.","output":"Spreader events and the limitations of projected networks for capturing dynamics on multipartite networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity before and during pregnancy leads to reduced offspring cardiometabolic health.

A better understanding of the infectious disease impact on children in armed conflict will allow aid organizations to anticipate and mitigate the most serious problems. RECENT FINDINGS: Armed conflicts are estimated to have caused approximately 30 million civilian deaths during the past 27 years, with two-thirds occurring in women and children. Children are extremely vulnerable to the mass population displacements, experiencing a combined loss of safety, nutrition, shelter, hygiene, and health care. Under these circumstances, the emergence and prevalence of multiple infectious diseases can result in heightened morbidity and mortality long after active conflict ceases. SUMMARY: Factors leading to increased infectious diseases in populations in crisis due to armed conflict and lessons learned from recent outbreaks are discussed in detail. Acute respiratory infections, diphtheria, measles, varicella, and cholera are a few of the more common infectious diseases that take advantage of populations displaced or disrupted by conflict. Key issues include the ability of countries or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to keep up with basic childhood immunizations, and how rapidly disease outbreaks are recognized and addressed with disease-specific interventions.","output":"Pediatric Infectious Diseases Encountered During WartimePart 1: Experiences and Lessons Learned From Armed Conflict in the Modern Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccine-preventable diseases and multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are common outside of the US, and multiple infectious outbreaks have been linked to travelers. Boston Childrens Hospital cared for 2796 international patients in 2016 but lacked an infection risk screening process for these patients, placing patients and staff at risk. We developed the Assessing Infection Risks for Safe Healthcare of International Patients (AIRSHIP) protocol to identify risks to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of IPC, infectious diseases, and International Health Services (IHS) experts assessed current IHS intake procedures and stakeholder engagement. We then developed AIRSHIP, devising standardized processes and forms to (1) assess underimmunization, MDRO and tuberculosis history, recent exposures, and current symptoms and (2) triage cases for catch-up immunization, urgent healthcare evaluation, and/or IPC intervention (Figure 1). We piloted incorporation of AIRSHIP into existing intake procedures. We tracked process, outcome, and balancing measures to evaluate feasibility, effectiveness, and acceptability to families (Figure 2) and made iterative improvements through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. RESULTS: For our first 13 cases, we completed pre-arrival family and referring provider interviews in 5 cases and on-arrival family interviews in 8 cases (in no cases were both pre-arrival and on-arrival interviews feasible). We were able to assign a risk category in all cases, identifying 5 patients with infection risks (38%) and 4 who were undervaccinated (30%). In 7 of 8 cases (88%) in which on-arrival interviews were performed, the interview and referring provider records yielded complete and reliable data. The average duration of family interviews was 18 minutes. All 13 families reported being very satisfied with AIRSHIP. CONCLUSION: International patients often present with active infections and are commonly undervaccinated. A feasible and effective strategy for infection risk screening of international patients is review of records pre-arrival, together with on-arrival family interview to gather additional data and identify acute symptoms and exposures.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the psychological well-being of physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, survey-based study, targeting physicians in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was to assess the psychological impact that the pandemic had on physicians by using a questionnaire that was previously designed and used by Reynold's et al. to survey Canadians during the SARS outbreak in 2003. The questionnaire assessed respondents' understanding of the rationale for quarantine, quarantine behaviors (including difficulties and compliance), as well as socio-economic and psychological impacts through answers that are based on a Likert scale. We also assessed the possible risk factors for psychological disorders related to the pandemic. RESULTS: The study included 529 physicians from various regions in Saudi Arabia. The enrolled physicians were practicing different specialties and branches in medicine. We classified them based on their workplace in relation to COVID-19 exposure to: COVID-19 designated center vs. non-COVID-19 designated centers. Furthermore, we subdivided the physicians who work in COVID-19 designated centers to those who work in high-risk areas such as ER, ICU and COVID-19 isolation wards and other areas as low-risk areas. The most common feelings reported by the physicians during the pandemic were: worry (357, 67.5%), isolation (301, 56.9%) and fear (263, 49.7%). According to logistic regression analysis, physicians older than age 60 were less likely to feel isolated (OR = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.01-0.96, P = 0.05), female physicians were more likely to experience fear (OR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.20 C 7.27, P = 0.02) and worry (OR = 2.87,95% CI = 1.23 C 6.69, P = 0.02), while physicians with a previous exposure to similar traumatic events were less likely to experience fear (OR = 0.24, 0.10 C 0.64, P = 0.004) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We previously developed a blended-model training program, customizable according to role and specialty; this method of training was not feasible in the pandemic response. We describe the development and implementation of a multi- and interdisciplinary telemedicine provider training program enabling the rapid scaling of telemedicine at our institution. Methods: An existing curriculum was pared down to a 1-h session delivered synchronously, covering the foundational components of telemedicine practice. Supplemental materials were available for asynchronous learning via the hospital intranet. Completion of training was required of all clinicians who practice telemedicine. Results: We conducted 35 sessions for 1,070 providers over 12 weeks. Attendees included clinicians across numerous roles and specialties. Additional resources were created and available through the Telemedicine Virtual Handbook and housed in specific toolkits. Discussion: Telemedicine training is necessary for consistent, competent practice of telemedicine in pediatrics. We describe a training process that can be easily replicated and rapidly deployed to providers of telemedicine across roles and disciplines. Combining a mandatory and brief synchronous provider training session with a repository of online resources creates a foundation for consistent practice, while allowing for more individualized resources accessible on demand. Standardized telemedicine training followed by mechanisms for ongoing professional practice evaluation allow institutions to ensure consistent and competent practice of telemedicine.

The effluent organic matters (EfOM) are well-known photosensitizers for the generation of reactive species, mainly including the triplet states of EfOM (3EfOM*), singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (?OH), which contribute to the removal of trace pollutants in water. However, the effect of UV254 disinfection on the photoreactivity of EfOM remains unclear. Here we investigated the photophysical and photochemical properties variation of EfOM after UV254 disinfection, along with humic substances (HS) as comparison. The UV254 disinfection caused a decrease of aromaticity, fluorescence intensity and molecular weight for all samples, while a reduction formation of triplet state of these dissolved organic matters (3DOM*), 1O2, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide anions (O2?-) under simulated sunlight was observed. In contrast, the generation of ?OH was increased after UV254 disinfection. The quantum yield of 1O2 was positively correlated with triplet quantum yield coefficient (fTMP) in all cases. However, the quantum yield of ?OH exhibited positive and negative correlations with fTMP for EfOM and HS, respectively. The quantum yields showed positive correlations with E2/E3 (ratio of the absorbance at 254 to 365 nm) for untreated DOM samples, while for the first time we found the trends differ distinctly after UV254 disinfection.

We experimentally show that consumers engage in multitasking behavior as a way to compensate for feelings of low control. Specifically, across five main studies and seven Web Appendix studies using two different multitasking paradigms, we find that consumers feeling low (vs. high) control volitionally choose to multitask more on subsequent tasks, rather than do the tasks sequentially (i.e., one task at a time). Mediation and moderation evidence demonstrate that this effect is driven by increased motivations to use time resources efficiently for those feeling low (vs. high) control. We also find that multitasking generally results in suboptimal consumer decision making and decreased task performance. An intervention that altered consumer lay beliefs regarding multitasking and time efficiency was effective in lowering multitasking behavior for consumers experiencing low control during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It has a population of around thirty-three thousand and shares a land border with Spain.The first reported case of Covid-19 in Gibraltar was reported on the 4th March 2020 from a Gibraltarian returning from Northern Italy. Early modelling completed by the Department of Public Health in March 2020 estimated the potential for five hundred Covid-19 related hospital admissions. St. Bernards Hospital is the only hospital in Gibraltar and has a capacity of around one hundred and fifty beds.The key issues identified early on were identifying a venue of sufficient capacity to create a Covid-19 field hospital, oxygen requirements and the actual building of the facility. A recently completed sports facility was identified as being available which had sufficient capacity to provide spaces for three hundred beds.The major challenge was ensuring adequate oxygen delivery to the field hospital. As it was in a remote location, oxygen had to be sourced independently of the main hospital. An operational decision was made to only admit patients who required 5L/min oxygen or less. A contingency plan was made to ensure oxygen cylinders could be charged within Gibraltar at two units: a newly commissioned oxygen plant and the local hyperbaric unit. The field hospital was operational by the time of the expected surge in Covid-19 cases.An important lesson is that each field hospital will have differing specialist needs but have a backbone of common requirements. New hospitals will need staff, equipment and a physical space. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic an important issue that was flagged up early was the requirement for substantial amounts of oxygen.

We here apply a novel approach, exploiting widespread growth regimes in COVID-19 detected case counts. By applying nonlinear dynamics methods to the exponential regime, we extract basic reproductive number R0 (i.e., the measure of COVID-19 inherent biological transmissibility), applying to the completely naive population in the absence of social distancing, for 118 different countries. We then use bioinformatics methods to systematically collect data on a large number of demographics and weather parameters from these countries, and seek their correlations with the rate of COVID-19 spread.

However, many seabirds are migratory, and it is difficult to understand the timing and location of their Hg accumulation. Seabirds may obtain Hg thousands of kilometers away, during their non-breeding period, and deposit that Hg into their terrestrial breeding colonies. We predicted that Hg concentration in rectrices reflects exposure during the previous breeding season, in body feathers reflects non-breeding exposure, and in blood collected during breeding reflects exposure during current breeding. To test this hypothesis, we measured total Hg concentration in these three tissues, which reflect different timepoints during the annual cycle of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) breeding on both sides of the North Pacific (Middleton Island in Alaska and Teuri Island in Hokkaido), and tracked their wintering movement patterns with biologging devices. We (i) identify the wintering patterns of both populations, (ii) examine Hg levels in different tissues representing exposure at different time periods, (iii) test how environmental Hg exposure during the non-breeding season affects bird contamination, and (iv) assess whether variation in Hg levels during the non-breeding season influences levels accumulated in terrestrial plants. Individuals from both populations followed a figure-eight looping migration pattern. We confirm the existence of a pathway from environmental Hg to plant roots via avian tissues, as Hg concentrations were higher in plants within the auklet colonies than at control sites. Hg concentrations of breast feathers were higher in Alaskan than in Japanese auklets, but Hg concentrations in rectrices and blood were similar. Moreover, we found evidence that tissues with different turnover rates could record local anthropogenic Hg emission rates of areas visited during winter.

The Neuroform EZ (Boston Scientific, Fremont, CA, U.S.A.) stent delivery system offers deployment of a Neuroform stent with fewer steps and improved operator control. Initial experience, technical considerations, and treatment outcomes using the Neuroform EZ stent delivery system in combination with coil embolization are reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventeen consecutive patients harboring 21 wide-necked saccular cerebral aneurysms were treated with stent reconstruction. Twenty aneurysms were unruptured; one was treated within 24 hours of diagnosis of rupture. Twenty aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation; one was in the posterior circulation. Immediate and six-month post-treatment angiography and clinical assessment were performed. RESULTS In all cases, the stents were delivered and positioned without difficulty in deployment. Technical complications occurred in 4 patients, but none were directly related to the stent delivery system. On immediate post-treatment angiography, 5 of 21 aneurysms showed complete occlusion, 5 of 21 showed residual neck, and 11 of 21 showed residual contrast filling of the aneurysm sac. At six month follow-up, all 17 patients were clinically stable. Angiography of 18 of the aneurysms showed total occlusion in 12, residual neck in 3, and residual aneurysm filling in 3. Retreatment was performed in the three with residual aneurysm. CONCLUSION The Neuroform EZ stent system offers improved anchoring and support in stent delivery, which is particularly useful when multiple stents are overlapped to further protect the parent vessel and increase flow diversion away from the aneurysm sac. The only significant problem encountered was coil prolapse, which could be treated with a second stent when necessary.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are the three major coronaviruses of present-day global human and animal health concern. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is identified as the newest disease, presumably of bat origin. Different theories on the evolution of viruses are in circulation, yet there is no denying the fact that the animal source is the skeleton. The whole world is witnessing the terror of the COVID-19 pandemic that is following the same path of SARS and MERS, and seems to be more severe. In addition to humans, several species of animals are reported to have been infected with these life-threatening viruses. The possible routes of transmission and their zoonotic potentialities are the subjects of intense research. This review article aims to overview the link of all these three deadly coronaviruses among animals along with their phylogenic evolution and cross-species transmission. This is essential since animals as pets or food are said to pose some risk, and their better understanding is a must in order to prepare a possible plan for future havoc in both human and animal health. Although COVID-19 is causing a human health hazard globally, its reporting in animals are limited compared to SARS and MERS. Non-human primates and carnivores are most susceptible to SARS-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, whereas the dromedary camel is susceptible to MERS-coronavirus. Phylogenetically, the trio viruses are reported to have originated from bats and have special capacity to undergo mutation and genomic recombination in order to infect humans through its reservoir or replication host. However, it is difficult to analyze how the genomic pattern of coronaviruses occurs. Thus, increased possibility of new virus-variants infecting humans and animals in the upcoming days seems to be the biggest challenge for the future of the world.

This interaction has been proposed as a potential risk factor in patients treated with RAAS inhibitors. OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed whether RAAS inhibitors modify the risk for COVID-19. METHODS: The RASTAVI (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial is an ongoing randomized clinical trial randomly allocating subjects to ramipril or control groups after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 14 centers in Spain. A non-pre-specified interim analysis was performed to evaluate ramipril's impact on COVID-19 risk in this vulnerable population. RESULTS: As of April 1, 2020, 102 patients (50 in the ramipril group and 52 in the control group) were included in the trial. Mean age was 82.3  6.1 years, 56.9% of the participants were male. Median time of ramipril treatment was 6 months (interquartile range: 2.9 to 11.4 months). Eleven patients (10.8%) have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (6 in control group and 5 receiving ramipril; hazard ratio: 1.150; 95% confidence interval: 0.351 to 3.768). The risk of COVID-19 was increased in older patients (p = 0.019) and those with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.066), lower hematocrit (p = 0.084), and more comorbidities according to Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (p = 0.065). Admission and oxygen supply was required in 4.9% of patients (2 in the ramipril group and 3 in the control group), and 4 of them died (2 in each randomized group). A higher body mass index was the only factor increasing the mortality rate (p = 0.039).

It is clear that the elderly are at most risk of the adverse impacts of the virus, including hospitalization and death. Others at risk are those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions and those with a hyper-excitable immune response. Treatment options for those with acute responses to the virus are limited and there is an urgent need for potential strategies that can mitigate these severe effects. One potential avenue for treatment that has not been explored is the microbiome gut/lung axis. In addition to those severely affected by their acute reaction to the virus, there is also a need for treatment options for those that are slow to recover from the effects of the infection and also those who have been adversely affected by the measures put in place to arrest the spread of the virus. One potential treatment option is photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy. PBM has been shown over many years to be a safe, effective, non-invasive and easily deployed adjunctive treatment option for inflammatory conditions, pain, tissue healing and cellular energy. We have also recently demonstrated the effectiveness of PBM to alter the gut microbiome. PBM therapy is worthy of consideration as a potential treatment for those most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with comorbidities. The treatment may potentially be advantageous for those infected with the virus, those who have a slow recovery from the effects of the virus and those who have been denied their normal exercise/rehabilitation programs due to the isolation restrictions that have been imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A Potential Role for Photobiomodulation Therapy in Disease Treatment and Prevention in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reported in individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 with non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines. We issue our recommendations on the diagnosis and management of patients presenting this complication. METHOD: The multidisciplinary working group, led by the Spanish Federation of Medical and Scientific Associations and including representatives of several scientific societies, reviewed the available evidence from the literature and reports of the European Medicines Agency. We establish a definition for suspected cases and issue diagnostic and treatment recommendations regarding vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia. RESULTS: We define suspected cases as those cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurring between 3 and 21 days after the administration of non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines, in patients with a platelet count below 150,000/L or presenting a decrease of 50% with respect to the previous value. Findings suggestive of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia include the presence of antibodies to platelet factor 4, D-dimer levels 4 times greater than the upper limit of normal, and unexplained thrombosis. The recommended treatment includes intravenous administration of non-specific human immunoglobulin or alternatively plasmapheresis, avoiding the use of heparin, instead employing argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for anticoagulation, and avoiding platelet transfusion.

The accurate interpretation of pupillometric data requires establishing clearly what the expected baseline unstimulated pupillary diameter at each specific level of hypnosis is. Opioids decrease pupillary diameter in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the effects of hypnotic drugs on pupillary diameter are not well known. Our aim was to describe the potential relationship between propofol predicted effect-site concentrations (Cets) ranging from 1 to 3 g/mL and pupillary diameter. METHODS Patients were randomized to receive propofol by target-controlled infusion at a predicted Cet of 1, 2, or 3 g/mL (groups P1, P2, and P3, respectively). Pupillary diameter measurements were performed after 10 minutes of steady-state propofol infusion at the randomized Cet. No stimulation was performed during the study. Heart rate and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously recorded. RESULTS Forty patients were included: (13, 14, and 13 in groups P1, P2, and P3, respectively). Mean pupillary diameter was 5.7 mm (1 mm) in group P1, 4.8 mm (1.3 mm) in group P2, and 3.3 mm (0.8 mm) in group P3. Propofol had a dose-dependent effect on pupillary diameter (linear regression R = 0.45, P < .001). Pupillary diameter was positively correlated with the BIS (Spearman r = 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54 to -0.87] P < .001). CONCLUSIONS From 1 to 3 g/mL of predicted Cet, propofol has a dose-dependent effect on pupillary diameter. Within this concentrations range, there is a positive correlation between BIS and pupillary diameter. The subcortical effect of propofol on pupillary diameter is correlated to its effect on the cortex. Studies assessing pupillary diameter as a marker of the nociception-antinociception balance should be performed in patients with a standardized depth of hypnosis.","output":"Effect of Different Concentrations of Propofol Used as a Sole Anesthetic on Pupillary Diameter: A Randomized Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak introduced dramatic changes in all our lives, daily practice, and medical conferences. In search of a tool to spread dermatologic knowledge during confinement, an online medical meeting was held on April 25th to 26th, 2020. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics, opinion and satisfaction of the attendees to a free-of-charge online congress. Secondarily, we intended to explain how this meeting was prepared. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online survey administered to the attendees to an online congress organised via the Telegram? Messenger App. Its organisation and planning, which needed no financial support and was done by volunteer organisers, moderators and speakers, is described step by step. RESULTS: The satisfaction of both speakers and attendees was very high. All participants considered that this format had a great present and future, and most of them rated it as superior to regular face-to-face meetings. Female gender and predominantly private practice favoured this opinion. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of most scientific gatherings. This has been seen by some authors as an excellent opportunity, encouraging medical societies and organisations to lead the change to virtual meetings. Although confinement did not allow real contact, our online meeting showed it was possible to ensure interaction and participation between attendees, moderators and speakers. Dermatologists enjoyed some dermatologic science, even despite the extraordinary circumstances disrupting their daily clinical practice.

We aimed to simulate the development trend of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei as well as estimate the number of COVID-19 cases with the government control policies and traffic control. Methods: We collected the COVID-19 data in Wuhan and Hubei (January 1, 2020 to April 8, 2020) and simulated three situations about COVID-19 epidemic trend: non-interference, government controlling behavior and traffic control by the SEIR model to analyzed the development and influence of the epidemic. Results: We adopted the SEIR model to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei peaked on the 107th day without human control, and the number in Wuhan peaked on the 51st day after the lockdown of Wuhan. The number of new cases in Hubei and Wuhan presented a skewed normal distribution in the time series. Government intervention and traffic control had a certain inhibitory effect on the daily increase of COVID-19 cases. During the period from January 23 to April 8, 2020, there was a difference of 1,253,433 cases between the daily number of confirmed cases and the actual number of confirmed cases in Hubei under the simulated state of without human control. Also, there was a difference of 953,202 cases between thedaily number of confirmed cases and the actual number of confirmed cases in Wuhan under the simulated state of without human control. Conclusion: The actual COVID-19 outbreak quantity conforms to the simulation results, secondly the government control behavior and the traffic control can effectively inhibit COVID-19 to spread and the efficient can reach 52%. In other countries or regions, an effective intervention measures can control the spread of the epidemic. The earlier the control started and the stronger the control intensity was, the more effective the intervention for the COVID-19 epidemic was, so appropriate to cut off the route of transmission as soon as possible.","output":"Study on the Transmission of COVID-19 in Hubei Province Based on SEIR Model with Intervention Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying factors related to healthcare professionals' mental health has become an imperative topic for offering mental health services to foster their psychological functioning.

The aim of the present experiment is to evaluate, on a molecular level for the first time, the value of vincamine in addition to pantoprazole in treating experimentally induced renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). One-hundred-and-twenty-eight healthy male Wistar albino rats were included. Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and malondialdehyde levels were assessed. ELISA was used to estimate the pro-inflammatory cytokines. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax genes was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. ERK1/2, JNK1/2, p38, cleaved caspase-3, and NF-B proteins expressions were estimated using western blot assay. The kidneys were also histopathologically studied. The IRI resulted in impaired cellular functions with increased creatinine, urea nitrogen, malondialdehyde, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 serum levels, and up-regulated NF-?B, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, p38, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. Furthermore, it down-regulated the expression of the Bcl-2 gene and upregulated the Bax gene. The treatment with vincamine, in addition to pantoprazole multiple doses, significantly alleviated the biochemical and histopathological changes more than pantoprazole or vincamine alone, whether the dose is single or multiple, declaring their synergistic effect.

Seventy-three articles were identified that addressed the study's research question including 42 articles on environmental factors, 20 articles on management conditions, and 11 articles on both. While variation was found between studies, findings highlight that coffee quality is vulnerable to changes in light exposure, altitude, water stress, temperature, carbon dioxide, and nutrient management. Both increases as well as decreases were found in secondary metabolites and sensory attributes that determine coffee quality in response to shifts in environmental and management conditions. The most consistent evidence identified through this systematic review includes the following two trends: (1) increased altitude is associated with improved sensory attributes of coffee and; (2) increased light exposure is associated with decreased sensory attributes of coffee. Research gaps were found regarding the effects of shifts in carbon dioxide, water stress, and temperature on the directionality (increase, decrease, or non-linear) of coffee quality and how this varies with location, elevation, and management conditions. This systematic review further identified the following research needs: (1) long-term studies that examine the interactive effects of multiple environmental factors and management conditions on coffee quality; (2) studies that examine the interaction between sensory attributes and secondary metabolites that determine coffee quality and; (3) studies on the feasibility of various climate-adaptation strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change on coffee quality.

While taking different paths, all three cities have experienced significant retail decline over the past century. The probability of store closure over time is compared to the metric distance of stores to the retail center of gravity (centrality), store location along well-used streets as measured by their Choice value (connectivity), and the number of surrounding stores (agglomeration). These three comparisons are statistically analyzed using simple line regression, panel regression, and spatial autoregressive probit models.

In the present study, the general health status of wild Pallas' cats in Mongolia was evaluated, including assessment of basal hematologic parameters and fecal corticoid metabolite concentrations. The prevalence of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii in Mongolian Pallas' cats, local domestic cats, and prey species also was determined based on serology and/or polymerase chain reaction analysis. Biologic samples (blood, feces, and/or brain tissue) were obtained from 15 wild Pallas' cats, 15 domestic cats, and 45 prey animals (rodents and pikas) captured in Mongolia during the summers of 2000 and 2001. Comparative data were obtained from nine captive Pallas' cats maintained in North American zoos. Based on physical examinations, complete blood counts, and blood chemistry analyses, only minor differences were observed in the general health status of wild and captive Pallas' cats. Fecal cortisol metabolite concentrations did not differ (P > 0.05) between populations, indicating that Pallas' cats in captivity and in the wild have similar basal adrenocortical activity. A pronounced difference (P < 0.01) in seroprevalence to T. gondii was observed between populations. Whereas all captive Pallas' cats exhibited elevated immunoglobulin titers (IgG > 2,048) to T. gondii, only two of 15 (13%) wild Pallas' cats were seropositive, with both cats having lower IgG titers (< 1,024). Furthermore, no evidence of exposure to this parasite was found in any of the Mongolian domestic cats or prey species. These findings suggest that wild Pallas' cats have minimal opportunity for exposure to T. gondii in their natural habitat and, typically, do not become infected with this parasite until being brought into captivity. Accordingly, maintenance of a viable captive population may require implementing effective strategies to prevent exposure of immunologically naive Pallas' cats to T. gondii and to reduce parasite transmission between seropositive females and their highly susceptible offspring.","output":"Exploring the ecologic basis for extreme susceptibility of Pallas' cats (Otocolobus manul) to fatal toxoplasmosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In its initial stages, GuillainCBarr syndrome (GBS) is difficult to identify, because diagnostic criteria may not always be fulfilled.

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records of patients admitted to our Neurology Unit with a confirmed diagnosis of GBS. The study sample was divided in two subgroups according to whether the neurophysiological examination was performed: within 7 days (very early group) or within 7C15 days (early group). H reflex, F waves, and motor and sensory conduction parameters were judged abnormal if they were outside the normal range for at least two nerves. We evaluated neurophysiological findings in MillerCFisher syndrome (MFS) separately. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 36 patients.

In this work, we propose a Precedence based Competitive Cascade (PCC) model for the propagation of competing rumor and counter-rumor cascades. We have presented a model to compute a belief based precedence value by which a user chooses to believe the rumor or counter-rumor received during information propagation. The influence of the rumor and the counter-rumor cascades in the OSNs is analyzed by considering a neighborhood based propagation approach. Another challenging issue which has been addressed in this work is to select the minimal seed set of users for the initiation of the counter-rumor so as to reduce the message overhead in the application. This has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to select the minimal set of seed users for counter-rumor to minimize the effect of the rumor.

It has been reported that a few conditions, including cancer, predispose individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe form of COVID-19. These findings led us to evaluate the susceptibility of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection by investigating ACE2 expression in their tumor tissues. The expression analysis revealed that both mRNA and protein levels of ACE2 had increased in colon cancer samples than normal group. Next, the prognosis analysis has indicated that the upregulation of ACE2 was not correlated with patient survival outcomes. Further assessment displayed the hypomethylation of the ACE2 gene promoter in COAD patients. This methylation status has a strong negative correlation with ACE2 gene expression. The functional enrichment analysis of the genes that had similar expression patterns with ACE2 in colon cancer tissues demonstrated that they mainly enriched in Vitamin digestion and absorption pathway. Finally, we found that ACE2 gene expression had a significant association with the immune cell infiltration levels in COAD patients.

In this systematic review, we aimed to identify and assess the measurement properties of all existing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) specific for genitourinary symptoms that were developed and/or validated for measuring patient-reported outcomes in postmenopausal women. METHODS Studies which evaluated, described, or compared measurement properties of PROMs were considered as eligible. We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science. The methodological quality of each study was assessed using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) Risk of Bias checklist. Furthermore, predefined quality criteria for good measurement properties were applied and the quality of the evidence was graded. RESULTS Nine articles reporting on four PROMs were included. Two instruments, the Vulvovaginal Symptoms Questionnaire and the Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging Questionnaire, can be further recommended for use. Both showed moderate to high quality of evidence for sufficient structural validity, internal consistency, and construct validity. The two other instruments, urogenital atrophy quality of life (UGAQoL) and the Urogenital Symptom Scale, cannot be recommended for use, whereby the UGAQoL still has the opportunity to be recommended if the authors gave access to the instrument and further validation studies were conducted. CONCLUSIONS Both Vulvovaginal Symptoms Questionnaire and Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging Questionnaire can be recommended for use and results obtained with these two instruments can be seen as trustworthy. Future validation studies should focus on those two instruments.","output":"Measurement properties of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that may increase transmissibility and/or cause escape from immune responses, there is an urgent need for the targeted surveillance of circulating lineages.

From 2013 to 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey completed multi-stressor/multi-assemblage stream ecological assessments in five regions of the United States (434 streams total). Diatom, invertebrate, and fish communities were enumerated, and five types of potential stressors were quantified: habitat disturbance, excess nutrients, high flows, basic water quality, and contaminants in water and sediment. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models for each biological assemblage and region generally included variables from all five stressor types and multiple stressors types in each model was the norm. Classification and regression tree (CART) models then were used to determine thresholds for each BRT model variable above which there appeared to be adverse effects (multi-metric index (MMI) models only). In every region and assemblage there was a significant inverse relation between the MMI and the number of stressors exerting potentially adverse effects. The number of elevated instream stressors often varied substantially for a given level of land-use development and the number of elevated stressors was a better predictor of biological condition than was development. Using the adverse effects-levels that were developed based on the BRT model results, 68% of the streams had two or more stressors with potentially adverse effects and 35% had four or more.

NKG7 expressed by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells played key roles in promoting inflammation during visceral leishmaniasis and malaria-two important parasitic diseases. Additionally, NKG7 expressed by natural killer cells was critical for controlling cancer initiation, growth and metastasis. NKG7 function in natural killer and CD8+ T cells was linked with their ability to regulate the translocation of CD107a to the cell surface and kill cellular targets, while NKG7 also had a major impact on CD4+ T cell activation following infection.

Such strategies are unlikely to be adopted in mass eating settings without clear evidence of customer support; confirmation in specific contexts is needed. Inspired by the Taxonomy of Choice Architecture, we assessed support for eight types of nudging to increase the choice of FV-rich foods in a university food service. We also explored whether and to what extent nudge support was associated with perceived effectiveness and intrusiveness. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with students who used on-campus cafeterias. Multiple recruitment methods were used. Participants were given 20 specific scenarios for increasing FV selection and asked about their personal support for each nudge, as well as perceived intrusiveness and effectiveness. General beliefs about healthy eating and nudging were also measured. Results were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA for the 8 nudge types. RESULTS: All nudge scenarios achieved overall favourable ratings, with significant differences among different types of nudging by the 298 respondents. Changing range of options (type B3) and changing option-related consequences (type B4) received the highest support, followed by changing option-related effort (type B2) and making information visible (type A2). Translating information (type A1), changing defaults (type B1) and providing reminders or facilitating commitment (type C) were less popular types of nudging. Providing social reference points (type A3) was least supported. Support for nudge types was positively associated with the belief that food services have a role in promoting healthy eating, perceived importance of FV intake, trustworthiness of the choice architect and female gender. Lastly, support for all types of nudges was positively predicted by perceived effectiveness of each nudge and negatively predicted by perceived intrusiveness above and beyond the contribution of general beliefs about healthy eating and nudging. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the current study indicate significant differences in support for nudge techniques intended to increase FV selection among university cafeteria users.

Despite several governmental and non-governmental agencies interventions, Nigeria has yet to achieve significant gains in childhood immunization coverage. This study identifies intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and policy-level factors that influence childhood immunization uptake from various stakeholders perspectives using the Socioecological Model (SEM). METHODS: Using the Socioecological Model as a guiding framework, we conducted ten focus group sessions with mothers/caregivers and community leaders residing in Lagos state and nine semi-structured interviews with healthcare workers who provide routine immunization services in Lagos state primary healthcare facilities. We performed a qualitative analysis of focus groups and semi-structured interviews using deductive coding methods. RESULTS: The study sample included 44 mothers/caregivers and 24 community leaders residing in Lagos State, Nigeria, and 19 healthcare workers (routine immunization focal persons) working in the primary healthcare setting in Lagos state. Study participants discussed factors at each level of the SEM that influence childhood immunization uptake, including intrapersonal (caregivers immunization knowledge, caregivers welfare and love of child/ren), interpersonal (role of individual relationships and social networks), organizational (geographical and financial access to health facilities, health facilities attributes, staff coverage, and healthcare worker attributes), community (community outreaches and community resources), and policy-level (free immunization services and provision of child immunization cards). Several factors were intertwined, such as healthcare workers education of caregivers on immunization and caregivers knowledge of vaccination.

Better knowledge of the seroprevalence and immune response after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in this population is important to manage them safely during the pandemic. METHODS: 922 cancer patients, 100 non-cancer patients and 94 health care workers (HCW) attending the Multidisciplinary Oncology Unit of Antwerp University Hospital from 24th of March 2020 till 31st of May 2020, and the Oncology Unit of AZ Maria Middelares Hospital, Ghent, from 13th of April 2020 till 31st of May 2020 participated in the study. The Alinity? (A; Abbott) and Liaison? (D; DiaSorin) commercially available assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while total SARS-CoV-2 Ig was measured by Elecsys? (R; Roche). RESULTS: In the overall study population IgG/total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in respectively 32/998 (3.2%), 68/1020 (6.7%), 37/1010 (3.7%) and of individuals using the A, D or R test. Forty-six out of 618 (7.4%) persons had a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Seroprevalence in cancer patients (A:2.2%, D:6.2%, R:3.0%), did not significantly differ from that in non-cancer patients (A:1.1%, D:5.6%, R:0.0%), but was lower than the HCW (A:13%, D:12%, R:12%; respectively Fisher's exact test p = 0.00001, p = 0.046, p = 0.0004). A positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was found in 6.8% of the cancer patients, 2.3% of the non-cancer patients and 28.1% of the HCW (Fisher's exact test p = 0.0004). Correlation between absolute values of the different Ig tests was poor in the cancer population. Dichotomising a positive versus negative test result, the A and R test correlated well (kappa 0.82 p McNemar test = 0.344), while A and D and R and D did not (respectively kappa 0.49 and 0.57; result significantly different p McNemar test = <0.0001 for both). The rate of seroconversion (>75%) and median absolute antibody levels (A: 7.0 versus 4.7; D 74.0 versus 26.6, R: 16.34 versus 7.32; all >P Mann Whitney U test = 0.28) in cancer patients and HCW with a positive RT-PCR at least 7 days earlier did not show any differences. However, none (N = 0/4) of the patients with hematological tumours had seroconversion and absolute antibody levels remained much lower compared to patients with solid tumours (R: 0.1 versus 37.6, p 0.003; D 4.1 versus 158, p 0.008) or HCW (all p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: HCW were at high risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the pandemic. Seroprevalence in cancer patients was low in the study period. Although Ig immune response in cancer patients with solid tumours does not differ from healthy volunteers, patients with hematological tumours have a very poor humoral immune response. This has to be taken into account in future vaccination programmes in this population.

This study used a gender-based analysis to determine the prevalence of psychosocial symptoms and substance use (alcohol and cannabis use in particular) by age, ethnicity, income, rurality, education level, Indigenous status, and sexual orientation. METHODS: Participants in the study were recruited from previously established cohorts as a part of the COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Study of a Provincial Population-Based Cohort for Gender and Sex (RESPPONSE) study. Those who agreed to participate were asked to self-report symptoms of depression, anxiety, pandemic stress, loneliness, alcohol use, and cannabis use across five phases of the pandemic as well as retrospectively before the pandemic. RESULTS: For all psychosocial outcomes, there was a significant effect of time with all five phases of the pandemic being associated with more symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness relative to pre-COVID levels (p < .0001). Gender was significantly associated with all outcomes (p < .0001) with men exhibiting lower scores (i.e., fewer symptoms) than women and gender diverse participants, and women exhibiting lower scores than the gender diverse group. Other significant predictors were age (younger populations experiencing more symptoms, p < .0001), ethnicity (Chinese/Taiwanese individuals experiencing fewer symptoms, p = .005), and Indigenous status (Indigenous individuals experiencing more symptoms, p < .0001).

Therefore, we aimed to conduct one of the first evaluations of vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with cancer at a population level. METHODS: In this population-based test-negative case-control study of the UK Coronavirus Cancer Evaluation Project (UKCCEP), we extracted data from the UKCCEP registry on all SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results (from the Second Generation Surveillance System), vaccination records (from the National Immunisation Management Service), patient demographics, and cancer records from England, UK, from Dec 8, 2020, to Oct 15, 2021. Adults (aged 18 years) with cancer in the UKCCEP registry were identified via Public Health England's Rapid Cancer Registration Dataset between Jan 1, 2018, and April 30, 2021, and comprised the cancer cohort. We constructed a control population cohort from adults with PCR tests in the UKCCEP registry who were not contained within the Rapid Cancer Registration Dataset. The coprimary endpoints were overall vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough infections after the second dose (positive PCR COVID-19 test) and vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough infections at 3C6 months after the second dose in the cancer cohort and control population. FINDINGS: The cancer cohort comprised 377 194 individuals, of whom 42 882 had breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections. The control population consisted of 28 010 955 individuals, of whom 5 748 708 had SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 698% (95% CI 698C699) in the control population and 655% (651C659) in the cancer cohort. Vaccine effectiveness at 3C6 months was lower in the cancer cohort (470%, 463C476) than in the control population (614%, 614C615). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccination is effective for individuals with cancer, conferring varying levels of protection against breakthrough infections. However, vaccine effectiveness is lower in patients with cancer than in the general population. COVID-19 vaccination for patients with cancer should be used in conjunction with non-pharmacological strategies and community-based antiviral treatment programmes to reduce the risk that COVID-19 poses to patients with cancer.

In this paper, the transfer learning technique has been applied to clinical images of different types of pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19. It is found that COVID-19 is very much similar to pneumonia lung disease. Further findings are made to identify the type of pneumonia similar to COVID-19. Transfer Learning makes it possible for us to find out that viral pneumonia is same as COVID-19. This shows the knowledge gained by model trained for detecting viral pneumonia can be transferred for identifying COVID-19. Transfer Learning shows significant difference in results when compared with the outcome from conventional classifications. It is obvious that we need not create separate model for classifying COVID-19 as done by conventional classifications. This makes the herculean work easier by using existing model for determining COVID-19. Second, it is difficult to detect the abnormal features from images due to the noise impedance from lesions and tissues. For this reason, texture feature extraction is accomplished using Haralick features which focus only on the area of interest to detect COVID-19 using statistical analyses. Hence, there is a need to propose a model to predict the COVID-19 cases at the earliest possible to control the spread of disease. We propose a transfer learning model to quicken the prediction process and assist the medical professionals. The proposed model outperforms the other existing models. This makes the time-consuming process easier and faster for radiologists and this reduces the spread of virus and save lives.","output":"Detection of COVID-19 using CXR and CT images using Transfer Learning and Haralick features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmembrane metalloprotease aminopeptidase\\\\N (APN)/CD13 is overexpressed in various solid and hematological malignancies in humans, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is thought to influence tumor progression.

Daily messages and weekly activities were sent by moderators to promote maternalCchild outcomes: child nutrition, child sleep, nurturing care, and maternal psychosocial well-being (assessed pre- and post-intervention via self-reported questionnaire). The implementation and engagement of the mothers in the program were assessed by message extraction. Acceptability was evaluated through in-depth interviews (n = 5) and open-ended surveys (n = 10). 1481 messages were exchanged in 3 WhatsApp groups (n = 30 mothers).

We utilized survey data to quantify people's abidance by the mask mandate order. Additionally, we implicitly addressed the extent to which people abide by the mask mandate order that may depend on some parameters like population, income, and education level. Using different machine learning classification algorithms, we investigated how the decrease or increase in death ratio for the counties in the US West Coast correlates with the input parameters. The results showed that for most counties there, the mask mandate order decreased the death ratio reflecting the effectiveness of this preventive measure on the West Coast.

As the population ages, AD and related dementia are becoming the biggest epidemic in medical history: the number of people aged 65 and older with AD is projected to increase between two- and three-fold by 2050. Imaging and biomarker studies suggest that the pathophysiological processes of AD begin more than a decade before the diagnosis of dementia, opening the possibility of early, preemptive prediction. For accurate prediction, it is important although challenging to fully understand how multiple etiologies and age-related prodromal processes contribute to the onset of Alzheimer's continuum, across a long period comparable to the lifespan. Addressing this challenge was one of the overarching transformative concepts at the 2015 AD Research Summit, \\"to develop new programs on systems biology and integrative physiology to gain a deeper understanding of the complex biology of the disease.\\" Among other factors, cerebral microvascular degeneration (CMD) may play a key role in the onset and development of Alzheimer's continuum, potentially prior to, along with, or independently of the beta-amyloid (A?) accumulation. Despite its importance for early detection and as a therapeutic target for early intervention, it is unknown whether CMD is a causal factor for AD pathogenesis or an early consequence of multifactorial conditions that lead to AD at a later stage. Here, this Viewpoint suggests that we should fill two critical knowledge gaps: (1) Temporal relationships between various CMDs and other key factors before/during/after the onset of Alzheimer's continuum have not been established; (2) Little integrative study down to the capillary vessel level has been conducted on how individual defects in various microvascular structural and flow properties distinctly correlate with and/or contribute to neuronal degeneration. As the first step toward filling these gaps, I propose utilizing recent advances in microscopic imaging and image analysis techniques to longitudinally track a comprehensive set of CMDs over the lifespan in model animals, along with A?, tau, neuronal degeneration, and cognitive impairment when possible.","output":"Near-Lifespan Tracking of Cerebral Microvascular Degeneration in Aging to Alzheimer's Continuum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona virus disease has significantly affected lives of people around the world. Existing quarantine policies led to large-scale lock-downs because of the slow tracking of the infection paths, and indeed we see new waves of the disease. This can be solved by contact tracing combined with efficient testing policies. Since the number of daily tests is limited, it is crucial to exploit them efficiently to improve the outcome of contact tracing (technological or human-based epidemiological investigations). We develop a controlled testing framework to achieve this goal. The key is to test individuals with high probability of being infected to identify them before symptoms appear. These probabilities are updated based on contact tracing and test results. We demonstrate that the proposed method could reduce the quarantine and morbidity rates compared to existing methods by up to a 50%. The results clearly demonstrate the necessity of accelerating the epidemiological investigations by using technological contact tracing. Furthermore, proper use of the testing capacity using the proposed controlled testing methodology leads to significantly improved results under both small and large testing capacities. We also show that for small new outbreaks controlled testing can prevent the large spread of new waves.

We highlighted the incidence and prevalence, the cognitive pattern in neuropsychological studies, and the relationship between chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment and different risk factors. We estimated the effect sizes on each cognitive domain and differentiated effect sizes by each method of comparison of effects (i.e., baseline data, or control groups). Methods: The databases MEDLINE and Embase were searched for publications about taxane-related cognitive changes in patients with breast cancer published from 1980 to 2019. Cross-sectional and self-reported outcomes studies were excluded except for the depression item. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We estimated effect sizes for each cognitive domain and differentiated effect sizes by each method of comparison of effects. The review is reported in compliance with the PRISMA Statement; it was registered prospectively in PROSPERO as CRD42020163255. Results: Eleven studies meeting the criteria were analyzed, which resulted in a sample of 1,057 patients with breast cancer who received chemotherapy including 820 patients (77%) who received taxane-based chemotherapy. Attention and concentration, depression, and executive function domains had significant chemotherapy-induced impairment across all comparison types. Statistically significant improvement was found in language and verbal memory when comparing chemotherapy patients' test scores with baseline or matched controls. Taxane-based chemotherapy had a non-significant effect on processing speed, visual memory, visuospatial, and motor function domains. Conclusions: The occurrence of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment 6 months or more after the course of treatment in people with breast cancer is frequent in the domains of attention, executive function, and depression.

This survey was undertaken to explore inhaled ICU sedation practice in France. METHODS: In this national survey, medical directors of French adult ICUs were contacted by phone or email between July and August 2019. ICU medical directors were questioned about the characteristics of their department, their knowledge on inhaled sedation, and practical aspects of inhaled sedation use in their department. RESULTS: Among the 374 ICUs contacted, 187 provided responses (50%). Most ICU directors (73%) knew about the use of inhaled ICU sedation and 21% used inhaled sedation in their unit, mostly with the Anaesthetic Conserving Device (AnaConDa, Sedana Medical). Most respondents had used volatile agents for sedation for <5 years (63%) and in <20 patients per year (75%), with their main indications being: failure of intravenous sedation, severe asthma or bronchial obstruction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sevoflurane and isoflurane were mainly used (88% and 20%, respectively). The main reasons for not using inhaled ICU sedation were: \\"device not available\\" (40%), \\"lack of medical interest\\" (37%), \\"lack of familiarity or knowledge about the technique\\" (35%) and \\"elevated cost\\" (21%). Most respondents (80%) were overall satisfied with the use of inhaled sedation. Almost 75% stated that inhaled sedation was a seducing alternative to intravenous sedation. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the widespread knowledge about inhaled ICU sedation in France but shows its limited use to date. Differences in education and knowledge, as well as the recent and relatively scarce literature on the use of volatile agents in the ICU, might explain the diverse practices that were observed. The low rate of mild adverse effects, as perceived by respondents, and the users' satisfaction, are promising for this potentially important tool for ICU sedation.","output":"Use of volatile agents for sedation in the intensive care unit: A national survey in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hustle and bustle of the planet Earth have come to a halt thanks to the novel coronavirus.

The rate of postoperative complications is high with increased morbidity and mortality, a real challenge for the medical staff and surgical/intensive care unit teams. In emergency settings, patients were examined with targeted clinical and paraclinical parameters that assure a fast diagnosis to optimize a rapid medical and surgical treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective comparative study that included patients enrolled and diagnosed with an acute surgical abdomen in Surgical Clinic 1 Tg. Mures Emergency County Hospital. Patients were examined and analyzed at the emergency department UPU-SMURD. We included patients admitted over the two years (2019 and 2020) and divided them into two groups. Results: The total number of patients admitted in the UPU-Smurd emergency department Surgical Clinic I over the two years was 1033. There was a significant reduction in total cases diagnosed with the acute surgical abdomen in the pandemic period (p=0.033). The average time from the admission to the surgical procedure was significantly higher in the pandemic period 380?+-2 min in comparison with 222+-3 min (p=0.001) and also with an increased average operative time 223+-3 min versus 145+-2 min (p=0.002). Average hospitalization time was higher in the pandemic period 10+-1 (p=0.031) with no significant difference between the groups regarding Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (p=0.122). Overall mortality has more than doubled, with 31 cases (19%) in the pandemic and 28 (9%) in the non-pandemic. (p=0.001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has played an essential role in treating acute surgical abdomen cases. The high solicitation rate of the emergency department delayed the diagnosis and treatment of severe surgical cases.

CPPV-1 antigen identification in these tissues, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), supported the infection by the virus. PCR- and IHC-positivity in kidney tissues revealed atypical localization of the virus while in situ hybridization (ISH) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with the pop-off technique confirmed the first description of viral localization in kidneys. Complete genome characterization and deduced amino acid analysis of the obtained CPPV-1 from the fishing cats revealed FPV as a causative agent. The detected FPV sequences showed amino acid mutations at I566M and M569R in the capsid protein. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of complete coding genome sequences revealed that the fishing cat CPPV-1 genomes are genetically clustered to the FPV genomes isolated from domestic cats in Thailand. Since the 1970s, these genomes have also been shown to share a genetic evolution with Chinese FPV strains.

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent CB ablation in our institution from June 2018. From June 2019, we have been consistently using FoE suture for hemostasis (FoE+ group), and before that conventional manual compression was utilized (FoE- group). Ablations were performed under uninterrupted oral anticoagulant strategy. Both femoral veins were punctured, and a single introducer was placed in each vein. In the FoE- group, after ablation, protamine was administered, and manual compression was applied. In the FoE+ group, the suture was placed in both groins without protamine administration and manual compression. All patients were in decubitus position until the next morning. RESULTS A total of 190 consecutive patients (73.2% male, 59.7  11.0 years old) were evaluated, 90 being in the FoE+ group. There was no difference in the mean procedure duration between two groups (72.7  23.1 min vs 73.7  27.1 min, p = 0.784). However, the total lab time was significantly longer in FoE- group (132.9  35.3 min vs 109.9  32.6 min, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in complication rates.

MethodsHealth workers at multiple sites in Lagos were recruited to the study. For binding antibody measurement, IgG antibodies against SARS-COV-2 Wuhan-1 receptor-binding domain (RBD), trimeric spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N) and Omicron S1 were measured using the Luminex-based SARS-CoV-2-IgG assay by flow cytometry. For plasma neutralising antibody measurement, SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudovirus (PV) were prepared by transfecting 293T cells with Wuhan-614G wild type (WT), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and BA.1 (Omicron) plasmids in conjunction with HIV-1 expression vectors and luciferase encoding genome flanked by LTRs. We performed serial plasma dilutions from each time point and mixed plasma with PV before infecting HeLa-ACE2 cell lines, reading out luminescence and calculating ID50 (reciprocal dilution of sera required to inhibit 50% of PV infection). ResultsOur underlying study population receiving at least one dose of vaccine comprised 140 participants with a median age of 40 (interquartile range: 33, 48). 62/140 (44%) participants were anti-N IgG positive prior to administration of first vaccine dose. 49 had plasma samples available at baseline prior to vaccination and at two follow-up timepoints post two dose vaccination for neutralization assays. Half of the participants, 25/49 (51%) were IgG anti-N positive at baseline. Of the 24 individuals anti-N Ab negative at baseline, 12/24 had ID50 above the cut-off of 20. In these individuals, binding antibodies to S were also detectable, and neutralisation correlated with IgG anti-S, suggesting waning of N antibody after infection. Overall, neutralizing Ab titres to WT 1 month after second dose were 2579 and at 3 months post second-dose were 1695. As expected, lower levels of neutralization were observed against the Delta GMT 549 and Omicron variants 269 at 1 month. Positive anti-N IgG Ab status at baseline was associated with significantly higher titres of neutralizing antibodies following vaccination across all tested VOC. Those with anti-N Abs present at baseline did not experience waning of responses between months 1 and 3 post second dose. When data were analysed for negative anti-N IgG status at any timepoint, there was a significant decline in neutralization and binding antibodies between 1 month and 3 months post second-dose. The GMT in these individuals for Delta and Omicron was approximately 100, nearly a log lower in comparison to WT. We tested anti-N IgG in subjects who were anti-N IgG negative at baseline (n=78) and became positive between 1- and 3-months post second dose and found 7/49 (14%) with de-novo infection, with one additional participant demonstrating both reinfection and breakthrough infection to yield a total breakthrough rate of 8/49 (16%). Neutralising and binding Ab titres 1 month post vaccine, prior to breakthrough, were not associated with breakthrough infection. Neutralizing titres were higher at the last time point in individuals who had experienced vaccine breakthrough infection (with no evidence of infection prior to vaccine), indicating a boosting effect of infection in addition to vaccine. However, neutralisation and binding S antibodies against Omicron were low in those with either prior exposure or infection following two dose AZD1222. ConclusionsAZD1222 is immunogenic in this real world west African cohort with significant background seroprevalence and incidence of breakthrough infection over a short time period. Prior infection and breakthrough infection induced higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab responses at 3 months post vaccine against all widely circulating VOC. However, responses to Omicron BA.1 were low at three months regardless of hybrid immunity from prior exposure or breakthrough infection. Booster doses after AZD1222 should be considered in the African setting, even after natural infection, as future variants may be more pathogenic as well as immune evasive in the context of waning immunity.","output":"Antibody responses to AZD1222 vaccination in West Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The periodontal ligament (PDL) is an important component of periodontium to support dental structure in the alveolar socket. Regeneration of PDL tissue is an effective treatment option for periodontal disease and the profiling of genes involved in this process will be informative. Therefore, our study aims to accurately delineate the profiling of gene expression for PDL tissue regeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS We isolated PDL tissues and PDL fibroblasts (PDLFs) from premolar teeth, which were extracted from healthy periodontal status patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in PDL tissue and PDLFs were analyzed using Cap analysis gene expression, which is a second-generation sequencing technique to create profiling. We also determined the protein expression using Western blot. RESULTS Collagens (type I, III, and VI), noncollagenous proteins (periostin and osteonectin), and proteoglycans (asporin, lumican, decorin, and osteomodulin) were highly expressed in PDL tissue. Integrin, 1 was also expressed in PDL tissue. On comparison of gene expression between PDL tissue and PDLFs, four PDL marker genes, osteopontin, asporin, periostin, and osteonectin, were decreased in PDLFs. The genes for gene regulation were also highly expressed. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated the overall profiling of mRNA expression in PDL tissue and analyzed the important genes which may be useful for providing specific information for the reconstruction of PDL. We also identified the difference in gene expression between PDL tissue and PDLFs which might provide insights towards PDL regeneration.","output":"The profiling and analysis of gene expression in human periodontal ligament tissue and fibroblasts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to present empirical evidence that supports and quantifies the relationships among the following features in a Mexican university: interactive collaboration software tools used in online classes, the perceived presence of instructors, student engagement, and student satisfaction with online classes during the COVID-19 lockdown We collected data from 1417 participants from five different academic programs using a survey method Data were analyzed using SPSS v25 and WarpPLS Findings show that the interactive communication tool has a positive impact on perceived instructor presence, which also positively impacts student engagement and satisfaction These relationships were also found to be true after analyzing each academic program Therefore, both the interactive communication tool and the instructor play important roles in the online learning process because they positively influence student engagement and satisfaction Our results are consistent with previous work conducted before the pandemic and contribute to understanding the teaching and learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Interactive Learning Environments is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Instructor presence, interactive tools, student engagement, and satisfaction in online education during the COVID-19 Mexican lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged every aspect of ones life, especially in the education setting.

This has required research on the RNA molecules themselves, with the concomitant need for obtaining purified RNA samples, such as for structural studies by NMR or other methods. The main method to create labeled and unlabeled RNA, T7 in vitro transcription, suffers from sequence-dependent yield and often low homogeneity for short constructs (<100 nt) and requires laborious purification. Additionally, the design of structured RNA fragments mimicking the structure of a larger biological RNA is often not straightforward. Secondary structure simulations can be used to make reliable predictions about the folding of a particular RNA fragment. In this article, we describe how to design an RNA construct of interest from a larger sequence, and we combine several previously published improvements of the in vitro transcription method, such as the use of 2'-methoxy modifications and dimethyl sulfoxide or the use of tandem repeats, to increase yield and purity of in vitro-transcribed RNA. Together with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification procedure using both reversed-phase ion-pairing and ion-exchange HPLC, we provide a robust protocol to obtain highly pure RNA of short to intermediate length in large quantities. The protocol optimizes yield, especially for RNA starting with nucleotides other than G. At the same time, it is simplified, and the required time is reduced. The protocols described here constitute a versatile pipeline for the production of purified RNA samples and are suitable for users with little experience in liquid chromatography. ? 2021 The Authors.

Vasoactive peptides such as angiotensins cause multiple metabolic changes in vascular tissues, however these changes have not been characterized in detail. Angiotensin 1-7 is a peptide derived from angiotensin II through the action of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme type II. This exploratory study seeks to understand the metabolic responses of a human cerebral microvascular endothelial endothelial cell line to stimulation with vasoactive peptides, in vitro (Angiotensin II, Angiotensin 1-7). METHODS: We performed single cultures of the cell line (CLU-512-hCMEC/D), which was treated with Ang II, Ang 1-7 or vehicle. Cells and culture medium were sampled before and after treatments. The samples were subjected to the process of extraction of metabolites with organic solvents. Each treatment was prepared in three biological replicates and was followed by metabolite extraction. Determination of metabolic profiles was performed by multiplatform, non-targeted, metabolomic analysis, using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). To determine the differences in metabolic profiles between groups and to select statistically significant metabolites, multivariate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: We found 122 metabolites that varied between groups. In general, Ang II-induced changes were similar to those found for Ang 1-7. In particular, we found a reduction in the levels of several types of lipids including some bile salts, sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids and fatty acids. This study is our first step in characterizing methods to study the impact of vasoactive peptides and inflammatory molecules on the blood-brain barrier metabolome. Studying the modulation of the vascular tissue metabolome and endothelial cells could enhance our understanding of the effect of angiotensin 1-7 and ACE2 in pathologies such as COVID-19.","output":"Metabolomic responses in brain endothelial cells (CLU-512-hCMEC/D) to Angiotensin II and Angiotensin 1-7."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 'Ethics of sharing medical knowledge with the community: is the physician responsible for medical outreach during a pandemic?' Strous and Karni note that the revised physician's pledge in the World Medical Association Declaration of Geneva obligates individual physicians to share medical knowledge, which they interpret to mean a requirement to share knowledge publicly and through outreach. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Strous and Karni defend a form of medical paternalism insofar as the individual physician must reach out to communities who may not want, or know to seek out, medical advice, for reasons of public health and health equity. Strous and Karni offer a novel defence of why physicians ought to intervene even in insular communities, and they offer suggestions for how this could be done in culturally sensitive ways. Yet their view rests on an unfounded interpretation of the Geneva Declaration language. More problematically, their paper confuses shared and collective responsibility, misattributing the scope of individual physician obligations in potentially harmful ways. In response, this reply delineates between shared and collective responsibility, and suggests that to defend the obligation of medical outreach Strous and Karni propose, it is better conceptualised as a collective responsibility of the medical profession, rather than a shared responsibility of individual physicians. This interpretation rejects paternalism on the part of individual providers in favour of a more sensitive and collaborative practice of knowledge sharing between physicians and communities, and in the service of collective responsibility.","output":"Physician outreach during a pandemic: shared or collective responsibility?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adherence to protective behaviors is central to limiting the spread of COVID-19 and associated risk of serious illness and mortality in older populations. Whether cognition predicts adherence to protective behaviors has not been examined in older adults. AIMS: To examine whether specific cognitive abilities predict adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in older adults, independent of other relevant factors. METHODS: Data from 431 older adults (i.e., &#8805; 65 years) who took part in the COVID-19 module of the Health and Retirement Study were included in the present study. Separate binary logistic regression models were used to examine whether performance on measures of immediate and delayed recall and working memory predicted adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors, controlling for demographics, level of COVID-19 concern, depressive symptoms, and medical conditions. RESULTS: For every unit increase in immediate and delayed recall, the probability of adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviors increased by 47% and 69%, respectively. There was no association between the measure of working memory and adherence. DISCUSSION: It is of public interest to understand the factors that reduce adherence to protective behaviors so that we can better protect those most vulnerable and limit community spread. Our findings demonstrate that reduced memory predicts non-adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors, independent of virus concern, and other relevant demographic and health factors.

The detrimental effects of lockdown periods may vary among individuals, as well as among sports and sexes. This study investigated the changes in dietary habits, and the predictors of perceived stress during lockdown and a bubble training camp. This cross-sectional, online survey involved 76 elite and world-class athletes from six able-bodied sports and nine parasports, all of whom were involved in a 30-day bubble training camp. Questions were asked on socio-demographics, training routines and wellbeing, perceived stress, and dietary habits, pertaining to normal training (prelockdown), lockdown training, and bubble camp training periods. Changes in perceived stress were trivial to small during lockdown compared to normal training, and trivial to moderate during a bubble camp, compared to lockdown. Para-athletes, males, older athletes, less experienced athletes, married individuals, and specific ethnicities appeared to be more detrimentally affected (increased perceived stress) by lockdown. These negative experiences, however, were largely reversed during bubble camps. During lockdown, more athletes reported increased evening snack consumption (+8%), later meal-times (+6%), decreased fluid intake (?6%), and no breakfast (+7%). These changes were reversed during bubble camps (12C18% improvements). Sport classification accounted for 16% of the increased perceived stress (p = 0.001) during lockdown. Overall, socio-demographic factors, improvements in training routines, well-being, and dietary habits explained 28% of the decreased perceived stress during a bubble camp. In conclusion, better dietary habits, training routines and well-being have implications for reduced perceived stress. During lockdown, bubble camps may be beneficial, but this observation may be a case-by-case consideration, and short split bubble periods are recommended.","output":"Regression Analysis of Perceived Stress among Elite Athletes from Changes in Diet, Routine and Well-Being: Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown and Bubble Training Camps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak is severely affecting the overall mental health with unknown psychological consequences. Although a strong psychological impact is possible, scant evidence is available to date. Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress. This study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterized by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor. Methods: A total sample of 6,314 Italian people participated in this study. Participants were recruited between March 29 and May 04 2020 through an online survey. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and the Resilience Scale (RS) were administered. Demographic data and lockdown related information were also collected. A correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between psychopathological domains and resilience. Three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables and the resilience as independent variable controlling for age, gender, and education. COVID-19 specific variables were also included in the three regression analyses. A further exploratory analysis was carried out to examine which aspects of resilience predict depression, anxiety, and stress. Results: The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 32% for depression, 24.4% for anxiety, and 31.7% for stress. The sample mean scores on depression, anxiety, and stress were higher than the normal scores reported in the literature. Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that resilience was statically significant in predicting depression, anxiety, and stress. Geographic area of residence and infected acquaintances were also significant predictors. Regarding the resilience factors, results revealed that meaningfulness, perseverance, and equanimity were statistically significant in predicting all the DASS-21 scales. Conclusion: About a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being.

The Flares of Low back pain with Activity Research Study (FLAReS) takes a novel approach to distinguish the short-term effects of specific physical activities on LBP flares from the cumulative effects of such activities, by conducting a longitudinal case-crossover study nested within a cohort study. The first aim is to estimate the short-term effects ( 24 h) of specific physical activities on LBP flares among Veterans in primary care in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system. The second aim is to estimate the cumulative effects of specific activities on LBP-related functional limitations at 1-year follow-up. METHODS: Up to 550 adults of working age (1865 years) seen for LBP in primary care complete up to 36 Scheduled surveys over 1-year follow-up, and also complete unscheduled Flare Window surveys after the onset of new flares. Each survey asks about current flares and other factors associated with LBP. Surveys also inquire about activity exposures over the 24 h, and 2 h, prior to the time of survey completion (during non-flare periods) or prior to the time of flare onset (during flares). Other questions evaluate the number, intensity, duration, and/or other characteristics of activity exposures. Other exposures include factors related to mood, lifestyle, exercise, concurrent treatments, and injuries. Some participants wear actigraphy devices for weeks 1C4 of the study. The first aim will examine associations between 10 specific activity categories and participant-reported flares over 1-year follow-up. The second aim will examine associations between the frequency of exposure to 10 activity categories over weeks 1C4 of follow-up and long-term functional limitations at 12 months. All analyses will use a biopsychosocial framework accounting for potential confounders and effect modifiers. DISCUSSION: FLAReS will provide empirically derived estimates of both the short-term and cumulative effects of specific physical activities for Veterans with LBP, helping to better understand the role of physical activities in those with LBP.

Currently, no specific treatment available to prevent its oxidative stress and progression except for diet and lifestyle changes. Vitamin E such as tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) has a promising potential in preventing NAFLD progression. TRF is a potent antioxidant but has low bioavailability due to the use of long-chain triglycerides (LCT) as its carrier. Testing of potential therapeutic agents such as TRF are commonly carried out using animal models. These animal models are often costly due to limited access to the supply especially Asian countries and predisposed to high transportation cost. Lower expenditure of NAFLD model should be investigated without forfeiting the outcome of study. Therefore, this study addresses the gap by utilizing the ICR mice as NAFLD model through dietary modification and testing on the newly formulated TRF with combination of palm kernel oil (PKO) as a medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) carrier. Methods Fifteen ICR strain mice were randomly group into two control and one treatment group. Control groups received high-fat diet (HFD) only and standard diet while treatment group was given HFD with TRF (200 mg/kg/day). Study was carried out for 10 weeks. Weights were recorded twice a week. At the end of study, all mice were euthanized and data such weights, waist circumference and random blood glucose were recorded. Liver from each mouse were prepared for histology assessment. Results Mice mean weights and random blood sugar showed no difference between group (P>0.05) while significance waist circumference was larger in HFD and TRF groups compared to SD (P<0.05). Histology assessment showed steatosis in TRF group had lower severity compared to HFD group. NAFLD activity score (NAS) was lower in treatment group compared to HFD group. Conclusions TRF showed promising potential as an agent to reduce NAFLD progression in ICR mice. Further study at gene and protein levels are required to fully elucidate the mechanism of this new TRF formulation in reducing NAFLD progression.","output":"Palm tocotrienol rich fraction with palm kernel oil supplementation prevents development of liver steatosis in high fat diet ICR mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the betacoronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has only recently emerged, while Mycobacterium leprae, the etiological agent of leprosy, has endured for more than 2,000 years. As soon as the initial reports of COVID-19 became public, several entities, including the Brazilian Leprosy Society, warned about the possible impact of COVID-19 on leprosy patients. It has been verified that COVID-19 carriers can be either asymptomatic or present varying degrees of severe respiratory failure in association with cytokine storm and death, among other diseases. Severe COVID-19 patients show increased numbers of neutrophils and serum neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) markers, in addition to alterations in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The absence of antiviral drugs and the speed of COVID-19 transmission have had a major impact on public health systems worldwide, leading to the almost total collapse of many national and local healthcare services. Leprosy, an infectious neurological and dermatological illness, is widely considered to be the most frequent cause of physical disabilities globally. The chronic clinical course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes, named leprosy reactions. These serious immunological complications, characterized by cytokine storms, are responsible for amplifying peripheral nerve damage. From 30% to 40% of all multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients experience erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a neutrophilic immune-mediated condition. ENL patients often present these same COVID-19-like symptoms, including high levels of serum NET markers, altered NLR, and neutrophilia.

METHODS: A secondary analysis of a prospective cross-sectional study which was conducted with a web-based global survey. RESULTS: Among the 3,550 responses from 65 countries, 2,621 responses with nation information were set as full data, 189 for South Korea and 2,432 for other countries. In Korea, there was no significant difference in healthy lifestyle behaviors between people with and without disabilities before the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceived physical and mental health and changes in eating habits during the COVID-19 pandemic showed no significant difference between people with and without disabilities in Korea. There were significant differences in physical health and dietary habits, but no differences in its effect on mental health between people living in Korea and other countries in both people with and without disabilities groups. In other words, more than 60% of people in all groups (disability vs. non-disability, Korea vs. non-Korea) reported worse mental health than before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nurses require specific skills to care for this vulnerable group of patients. At the same time, nurses report feeling inadequate and frustrated when they attempt to establish communication with mechanically ventilated, conscious patients. Methods: The purpose of this study was to explore nurses experiences taking care of conscious, intubated patients in the intensive care unit. The research questions aimed to identify i. the strategies that nurses use for communicating with patients, and ii. the barriers in communication between nurses and patients. This study employed a qualitative design. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 14 intensive care nurses working at ICUs in four different hospitals of Cyprus. The data were analyzed by applying thematic analysis. Results: We identified several strategies of unaided (movements -lips, hands, legs- facial expressions, gestures, touching) and aided forms of communication (pen and paper, boards, tablets, mobiles) used by nurses to communicate with patients. Additionally, barriers in communication were reported by participating nurses mainly pertaining to patients, nurses characteristics and the ICU environment. The health protocols imposed by the pandemic added more barriers in the communication between nurses and patients mostly related to the use of protective health equipment. Conclusions: The results of this study, combined with those of others in different countries, point to the difficulties nurses face when trying to communicate with conscious patients during mechanical ventilation. It appears that the complex communication needs of this group of patients are not being met mainly due to the lack of nurses training and of appropriate equipment to facilitate alternative and augmentative communication. Our study is amongst the first to add that the protective health protocols due to the pandemic imposed further communication barriers. Undoubtedly, the recognition of such an important issue creates an urgent need to educate nurses in alternative ways of communication with mechanically ventilated, conscious patients during their ICU stay.","output":"Communicating with Mechanically Ventilated Patients Who Are Awake.

Anonymized cell phone data on visits to POIs for each CBG before 2017 Hurricane Harvey were used to examine hurricane preparedness. Four categories of POI, grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies and home improvement stores, were identified as having close relationship with hurricane preparedness, and the daily number of visits from each CBG to these four categories of POIs were calculated during preparation period. Two metrics, extent of preparedness and proactivity, were calculated based on the daily visit percentage change compared to the baseline period. The results show that peak visits to pharmacies often occurred in the early stage, whereas the peak of visits to gas stations happened closer to landfall. The spatial and temporal patterns of visits to grocery stores and home improvement stores were quite similar. However, correlation analysis demonstrates that extent of preparedness and proactivity are independent of each other. Combined with synchronous evacuation data, CBGs were divided into four clusters in terms of extent of preparedness and evacuation rate. The clusters with low preparedness and low evacuation rate were identified as hotspots of vulnerability for shelter-in-place households that would need urgent attention during response.

We aimed to determine whether epidemic growth is globally associated with climate or public health interventions intended to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of all 144 geopolitical areas worldwide (375 609 cases) with at least 10 COVID-19 cases and local transmission by Mar. 20, 2020, excluding China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Using weighted random-effects regression, we determined the association between epidemic growth (expressed as ratios of rate ratios [RRR] comparing cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases on Mar. 27, 2020, with cumulative counts on Mar. 20, 2020) and latitude, temperature, humidity, school closures, restrictions of mass gatherings, and measures of social distancing during an exposure period 14 days previously (Mar. 7 to 13, 2020). RESULTS In univariate analyses, there were few or no associations of epidemic growth with latitude and temperature, but weak negative associations with relative humidity (RRR per 10% 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.96) and absolute humidity (RRR per 5 g/m3 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.99).

The aim of this study was to characterize the association between meatpacking plant exposure and clinical outcomes among emergency department (ED) patients with COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting to a single ED, from March 1 to May 31, 2020, who had: 1) symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and 2) a COVID-19 test performed. The primary outcome was COVID-19 positivity, and secondary outcomes included hospital admission from the ED, ventilator use, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay (LOS; <48 or &#8805;48 h), and mortality. RESULTS: Patients from meatpacking plants were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than the ED patients without this occupational exposure. Patients with a meatpacking plant exposure were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59 to 3.53) but had similar rates of hospital admission (aRR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.07) and hospital LOS (aRR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.23). There was no significant difference in ventilator use among patients with meatpacking and nonmeatpacking plant exposure (8.2% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.531), ICU admissions (4.1% vs. 12.0%, p = 0.094), and mortality (2.0% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.473). CONCLUSIONS: Workers in meatpacking plants in Iowa had a higher rate of testing positive for COVID-19 but were not more likely to be hospitalized for their illness.

However, it remains unclear which individuals are most susceptible. Electrocortical markers of reward processing, such as the reward positivity (RewP), are implicated in depression risk and may provide insights into who is most vulnerable to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examined whether pre-pandemic neural correlates of reward reactivity (i.e., RewP) moderated the impact of social and financial stress on changes in youth and mother depression symptoms pre-to-post pandemic onset. Youth (n = 45) and mothers (n = 45) in the current sample were recruited prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a larger study. RewP was assessed pre-pandemic, and depression symptoms were assessed pre- and post-pandemic onset for both youth and mothers. Additionally, social and financial chronic stress severity was assessed post-pandemic onset using a modified version of the UCLA Life Stress Interview. Financial stress was associated with prospective increases in depression for youth exhibiting blunted RewP at baseline. Similarly, family stress was associated with prospective increases in depression symptoms for mothers exhibiting blunted RewP at baseline. Findings suggest reduced reward responsiveness at the neural level may predispose both youth and mothers to future depression symptoms when exposed to higher levels of stress in the context of a pandemic.","output":"The interplay of stress and electrocortical reactivity to reward in the prospective prediction of depression symptoms during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals with eating disorders (EDs) have experienced deteriorating symptoms, increased isolation, and an increase in hospital admissions as a result of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Despite this, no systematic reviews have been conducted examining the COVID\\\\19 and ED peer\\\\reviewed literature. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on individuals with EDs. METHOD: Database searches of the peer\\\\reviewed literature were completed in the subsequent databases: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO (from November 2019 to October 20, 2021). All research reporting on the relationship between the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on individuals with EDs were included. RESULTS: Fifty\\\\three studies met the inclusion criteria, including 36,485 individuals with EDs. The pooled hospital admissions across the studies demonstrated on average a 48% (pre = 591, post = 876, n = 10 studies) increase in admissions during the pandemic compared to previous pre\\\\pandemic timepoints. In this review, 36% of studies (n = 19) documented increases in eating disorder symptoms during the pandemic, this increase in eating disorder symptoms were documented in AN, BED, BN, and OFSED patients. Studies also demonstrated increases in anxiety (n = 9) and depression (n = 8), however patterns of change appeared to be diagnostic and timing specific (e.g., lockdowns). DISCUSSION: We found a large increase in the number of hospitalizations and an increase in ED symptoms, anxiety, depression, and changes to BMI in ED patients during the pandemic. However, these changes appeared to be diagnostic and timing specific. Many qualitative studies described deterioration in ED symptomatology due to decreased access to care and treatment, changes to routine and loss of structure, negative influence of the media, and social isolation. Future studies are needed to focus on pediatric populations, new ED diagnoses, and severity of illness at presentation. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: The scientific literature suggests that individuals with eating disorders have experienced deteriorating symptoms, increased isolation, and an increase in hospital admissions as a result of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. This study synthesized 53 articles and explored the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on patients with eating disorders. We found increases in eating disorder symptoms during the pandemic; this increase in eating disorder symptoms was documented in patients with common eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, binge\\\\eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and other specified feeding and eating disorders. This review also demonstrated changes in body mass index (an index used to classify underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults) and increases in anxiety and depression during the pandemic compared to previous timepoints; patterns of change appeared to be related to timing of lockdowns.

However, current systems rely significantly on the high local oxygen levels and strongly acidic conditions (pH = 3.0-5.0). Simultaneously, the produced ROS can be rapidly consumed by intracellular glutathione (GSH) in the electron transport chain. Herein, an original and biomimetic CoO@AuPt nanocatalyst was prepared based on the assembly of Au and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of hollow CoO nanocapsules. The as-synthesized nanozyme exhibits extremely high stability under physiological conditions, whereas it undergoes spontaneous disintegration in the unique tumor microenvironment (TME). Subsequently, the decomposition products can catalyze a cascade of biochemical reactions to produce abundant ROS without any external stimuli. Thus, the present nanoplatform can increase intracellular ROS levels through continuous supply of H2O2, relief of local hypoxia and depletion of GSH, which result in remarkable and specific tumor damage both in vitro and in vivo.

METHODS: We collected blood samples from 38 patients with septic shock upon their admission to ICU and for the first 7 days of their stay. Syn-1 plasma level, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other organ damage, VFD, and cumulative fluid balance were assessed daily. RESULTS: Over the course of 7 days, Syn-1 plasma levels increased significantly more in patients with ARDS than in those without ARDS. Patients with high levels of Syn-1 in the 72 h after ICU admission had significantly higher cumulative fluid balance, lower PaO(2)/FiO(2), and fewer VFD than patients with low levels of Syn-1. Syn-1 levels did not correlate with sequential organ failure assessment score or with APACHE II score. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients with septic shock, higher circulating level of Syn-1 of cardinal glycocalyx component is associated with more ARDS, cumulative positive fluid balance, and fewer VFD.

It is typically described as objective hypoxia in the absence of proportional respiratory distress. The physiological basis for this phenomenon is controversial, and its prognostic value is unclear. We present a case below, of a 66-year-old female presenting with severe hypoxia that was managed without mechanical ventilation. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 66 year old female with multiple comorbidities initially presented with a cough, fever and an oxygen saturation of 70% on room air in the absence of respiratory distress or altered mentation. She subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the intensive care unit; received oxygen via high flow nasal cannula and continuous positive pressure mask. The patient remained in the intensive care unit for 40 days under close observation and exhibited multiple episodes of silent hypoxia on weaning oxygen. She was discharged on room air with an oxygen saturation >90% after 56 days. The patient was not intubated during her stay. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Clinicians face a clinical dilemma on whether to intubate a silently hypoxemic patient, who displays hypoxia out of proportion to clinical examination. The decision is confounded by a lack of clear evidence on whether the benefits of precautionary intubation outweighs the risks, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. A recent paradigm shift that recommends delaying intubation further displays the need for clearer analysis of the situation. Our case demonstrates a favorable outcome of the latter approach, yet emphasizes a case-by-case approach until clearer recommendations are available.","output":"Caution against precaution: A case report on silent hypoxia in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Terminal complement pathway deficiencies often present with severe and recurrent infections.

This study investigated the clinical outcome and genetic variation in a large UK multi-center cohort with primary and secondary terminal complement deficiencies. METHODS: Clinicians from seven UK centers provided anonymised demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on patients with terminal complement deficiencies, which were collated and analysed. RESULTS: Forty patients, median age 19 (range 3C62) years, were identified with terminal complement deficiencies. Ten (62%) of 16 patients with low serum C5 concentrations had underlying pathogenic CFH or CFI gene variants. Two-thirds were from consanguineous Asian families, and 80% had an affected family member. The median age of the first infection was 9 years. Forty-three percent suffered meningococcal serotype B and 43% serotype Y infections. Nine (22%) were treated in intensive care for meningococcal septicaemia. Two patients had died, one from intercurrent COVID-19. Twenty-one (52%) were asymptomatic and diagnosed based on family history. All but one patient had received booster meningococcal vaccines and 70% were taking prophylactic antibiotics. DISCUSSION: The genetic etiology and clinical course of patients with primary and secondary terminal complement deficiency are variable. Patients with low antigenic C5 concentrations require genetic testing, as the low level may reflect consumption secondary to regulatory defects in the pathway. Screening of siblings is important.

Occupational competency had no significant association with mental health; however, it directly affects turnover intention. The findings will contribute not only to career plan guidelines for cabin crew aspirants, but also to airlines recruitment strategies as well as human resources management in aviation industry.","output":"MBTI Personality Types of Korean Cabin Crew in Middle Eastern Airlines, and Their Associations with Cross-Cultural Adjustment Competency, Occupational Competency, Coping Competency, Mental Health, and Turnover Intention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extent to which interspecific niche differences structure plant communities is highly debated, with extreme viewpoints ranging from fine\\\\scaled niche partitioning, where every species in the community is specialized to a distinct niche, to neutrality, where species have no niche or fitness differences. However, there exists a default position wherein niches of species in a community are determined by their evolutionary and biogeographic histories, irrespective of other species within the community. According to this viewpoint, a broad range of pair\\\\wise niche overlapsfrom completely overlapping to completely distinctare expected in any community without the need to invoke interspecific interactions. We develop a method that can test for both habitat associations and niche differences along an arbitrary number of spatial and temporal niche dimensions and apply it to a 24\\\\yr data set of the eight dominant woody\\\\plant species (representing 84% and 76% of total community abundance and basal area, respectively) from a 50\\\\ha permanent plot in a southern Indian tropical dry forest, using edaphic, topographic, and precipitation variables as niche axes. Species separated into two broad groups in niche spaceone consisting of three canopy species and the other of a canopy species and four understory speciesalong axes that corresponded mainly to variation in soil P, Al and a topographic index of wetness. Species within groups tended to have significantly greater niche overlap than expected by chance. Community\\\\wide niche overlap in spatial and temporal niche axes was never smaller than expected by chance. Species\\\\habitat associations were neither necessary nor sufficient preconditions for niche differences to be present. Our results suggest that this tropical dry\\\\forest community consists of several tree species with broadly overlapping niches, and where significant niche differences do exist, they are not readily interpretable as evidence for niche differentiation.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have extended their major role in tracking disease patterns, and in identifying possible treatments. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify potential COVID-19 protease inhibitors through shape-based Machine Learning assisted by Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics simulations. METHODS: 31 Repurposed compounds have been selected targeting the main coronavirus protease (6LU7) and a machine learning approach was employed to generate shape-based molecules starting from the 3D shape to the pharmacophoric features of their seed compound. Ligand-Receptor Docking was performed with Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) algorithms to identify highaffinity compounds from the list of selected candidates for 6LU7, which were subjected to Molecular Dynamic Simulations followed by ADMET studies and other analyses. RESULTS: Shape-based Machine learning reported remdesivir, valrubicin, aprepitant, and fulvestrant as the best therapeutic agents with the highest affinity for the target protein. Among the best shape-based compounds, a novel compound identified was not indexed in any chemical databases (PubChem, Zinc, or ChEMBL). Hence, the novel compound was named 'nCorv-EMBS'. Further, toxicity analysis showed nCorv-EMBS to be suitable for further consideration as the main protease inhibitor in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Effective ACE-II, GAK, AAK1, and protease 3C blockers can serve as a novel therapeutic approach to block the binding and attachment of the main COVID-19 protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) to the host cell and thus inhibit the infection at AT2 receptors in the lung.

Methods Analytical retrospective comparative study of two groups of patients: Group A: patients admitted before the state of alarm that forced confinement in the period from January 13 to March 13 compared to Group B: patients admitted in the two months of confinement, until the de-escalation period began, March 13-May 13. Epidemiological variables including age, personal history, type of fracture, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, and hospital stay were recorded. Results A total of 190 patients were included. 112 in the pre-confinement period and 78 in the confinement (30% decrease). The mean age (p = 0.007) and falls at home (p < 0.001) were higher in the confinement group. The postoperative (p = 0.006) and overall (p < 0.001) hospital stay were significantly less in the confinement group. No differences were found in the anatomical location of the lesion, sex, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, or death.

Using a cohort of PLN (phospholamban) p.Arg14del mutation carriers, we aimed to investigate whether a novel DNN-based approach can identify established ECG features, but moreover, we aimed to expand our knowledge on novel ECG features in these patients. METHODS: A DNN was developed on 12-lead median beat ECGs of 69 patients and 1380 matched controls and independently evaluated on 17 patients and 340 controls. Differentiating features were visualized using Guided Gradient Class Activation Mapping++. Novel ECG features were tested for their diagnostic value by adding them to a logistic regression model including established ECG features. RESULTS: The DNN showed excellent discriminatory performance with a c-statistic of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91C0.99) and sensitivity and specificity of 0.82 and 0.93, respectively. Visualizations revealed established ECG features (low QRS voltages and T-wave inversions), specified these features (eg, R- and T-wave attenuation in V2/V3) and identified novel PLN-specific ECG features (eg, increased PR-duration). The logistic regression baseline model improved significantly when augmented with the identified features (P<0.001).

For reasons of tilted and long linear staple line of rectal stump, circular anastomotic plane can make multiple intersections. The present study was designed to assess whether multiple intersections after double stapling technique is the risk factor of anastomotic complication in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 128 consecutive left colon and rectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic rectal resection with double stapling technique were enrolled in this study. In all cases, operator tried to reduce intersections by inversion and invagination techniques. They were subdivided into 3 groups: 58 patients with no intersection of staple lines (group A), 62 patients with 1 point of intersection (group B) and 8 patients with 2 points of intersection (group C). Intraoperative air leakage, incomplete cut ring, postoperative bleeding, anastomotic stenosis, and leakage were compared between the 3 groups. RESULTS Clinical anastomotic leakage was identified in 1 (group C) of 128 patients (0.7%). Overall anastomotic leakage rate was 0% (0/58) in group A, 0% (0/62) in group B, and 12.5% (1/8) in group C (P=0.001). In univariate analysis, intersections of staple lines were associated with anastomotic complications. There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups in multivariate analysis.

AIMS: : To describe self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and disease severity in PwMS on NTZ or FTY who received serology confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: : From 27(th) April to 3(rd) May, 2020, telephone interviews were conducted with 140 PwMS under treatment with NTZ or FTY in order to collect structured data on multiple sclerosis (MS) and COVID-19. The patients, all followed at our center, were classified as symptomatic, paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic on the basis of their self-reported clinical characteristics. COVID-19 severity was rated on a 7-point ordinal scale. In addition, in the period 4(th) May to 3(rd) June 2020 SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, using the Roche SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Elecsys?), was performed in 104/140 (74.2%) of the interviewed PwMS (50 treated with NTZ and 54 with FTY).

It is well known that rheumatic patients are at risk of developing infections because of their immunocompromised state. Moreover, drugs such as hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab that are widely used to treat rheumatic diseases are now being used to treat COVID-19. The aim of this multicentre retrospective study of rheumatic patients in the Italian regions of Lombardy and Marche was to determine whether patients receiving biological or small molecules treatment are more susceptible to the development of COVID-19 than the general population. METHODS: The local registry data of 10,260 rheumatic patients being treated with bDMARDs or small molecules were evaluated from 15 March to 23 April 2020. The final analysis was based on the registry data relating to 7.204, telephone contacts and/or outpatient visits. RESULTS: Forty-seven of the 7.204 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, seven of whom died; the patients who had symptoms resembling those of COVID-19 but had negative swabs were considered negative for the disease. The overall infection rate was 0.65, and the crude case fatality risk (CFR) in the patients with COVID-19 was 14.9%. There was no difference in the mortality rate among the patients receiving the different individual biological drugs or small molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the susceptibility of rheumatic patients to COVID-19 is the same as that of the general population, but confirm that age, disease duration, and the number of co-morbidities are associated with an increased risk of a severe form of the disease. It seems that immunosuppressants drugs do not effectively represent a risk factor for COVID- 19.","output":"Prevalence of COVID infections in a population of rheumatic patients from Lombardy and Marche treated with biological drugs or small molecules: A multicentre retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital PCR (dPCR) is the third-generation PCR that enables real-time absolute quantification without reference materials. Recently, global diagnosis companies have developed new dPCR equipment. In line with the development, the Lab On An Array (LOAA) dPCR analyzer (Optolane) was launched last year. The LOAA dPCR is a semiconductor chip-based separation PCR type equipment. The LOAA dPCR includes Micro Electro Mechanical System that can be injected by partitioning the target gene into 56 to 20,000 wells. The amount of target gene per wells is digitized to 0 or 1 as the number of well gradually increases to 20,000 wells because its principle follows Poisson distribution, which allows the LOAA dPCR to perform precise absolute quantification. LOAA determined region of interest first prior to dPCR operation. To exclude invalid wells for the quantification, the LOAA dPCR has applied various filtering methods using brightness, slope, baseline, and noise filters. As the coronavirus disease 2019 has now spread around the world, needs for diagnostic equipment of point of care testing (POCT) are increasing. The LOAA dPCR is expected to be suitable for POCT diagnosis due to its compact size and high accuracy.

The aim of the current study was to determine whether resection margins of 10 mm provide a survival benefit over narrower resection margins. METHODS A total of 425 laparoscopic liver resections were carried out in 351 procedures performed in 317 patients between August 1998 and April 2012. Primary laparoscopic liver resections for colorectal metastases were included in the study. Two-stage resections, procedures accompanied by concomitant liver ablations and one case of perioperative mortality were excluded. A total of 155 eligible patients were classified into four groups according to resection margin width: Group 1, margins of < 1 mm [n = 33, including 17 patients with positive margins (Group 1a)]; Group 2, margins of 1 mm to < 3 mm (n = 31); Group 3, margins of  3 mm to <10 mm (n = 55), and Group 4, margins of  10 mm (n = 36). Perioperative and survival data were compared across the groups. Median follow-up was 31 months (range: 2-136 months). RESULTS Perioperative outcomes were similar in all groups. Unfavourable intraoperative incidents occurred in 9.7% of procedures (including 3.2% of conversions). Postoperative complications developed in 11.0% of patients. Recurrence in the resection bed developed in three (1.9%) patients, including two (6.1%) patients in Group 1. Rates of actuarial 5-year overall, disease-free and recurrence-free survival were 49%, 41% and 33%, respectively. Median survival was 65 months. Margin status had no significant impact on patient survival. The Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI) generally underestimated survival. This underestimation was especially marked in Group 1 when postoperative BPI was applied. CONCLUSIONS Patients with margins of <1 mm achieved survival comparable with that in patients with margins of  10 mm. When modern surgical equipment that generates an additional coagulation zone is applied, the association between resection margin and survival may not be apparent. Further studies in this field are required. Postoperative BPI, which includes margin status among the core factors predicting postoperative survival, seems to be less precise than preoperative BPI.","output":"Margin status after laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases: does a narrow resection margin have an influence on survival and local recurrence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundTreatment strategies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evolved between pandemic waves.

METHODS We performed a prospective, randomized controlled study comparing operator radiation dose during cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (n=632) with or without pelvic MXPD. We measured operator radiation dose at 4 sites: left eye, chest, left ring finger, and right ring finger.

Respiratory viruses are a leading cause of pulmonary exacerbations in people with CF. While it was expected that SARS-CoV-2 would lead to severe infection in this population, only 500 confirmed cases have been identified with most being categorized as mild. We have recently shown that increasing intracellular pH with a novel inhaled alkaline treatment, Optate, inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in normal HAECs. We hypothesize that the baseline increased intracellular pH in the airways of people with CF is protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further hypothesized that pH regulatory proteins may contribute to this increased intracellular pH in CF beyond decreased secretion of bicarbonate. Methods: CF and non-CF primary HAECs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection of 1. SARS-CoV-2 viral titers in cell media were subsequently quantified by plaque assay. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were evaluated by visual microscopy. Results were compared between CF and non-CF HAECs. Levels of pH regulatory proteins NHERF1, LDHd, LDHb, LDHa, glutaminase, S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), DUOX1, CCNO, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2), carbonic anhydrase 12 (CA12), and ATP12a S-were measured in cell lysates from the same CF and non-CF HAECs by JESS automated western blot (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA, USA). Finally, pH was compared between the CF and non-CF HAECs using a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, pHrodo Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA, USA) imaged during fluorescent microscopy. Results: Intracellular pH of CF HAECs was significantly higher than non-CF HAECs (n = 6, p &lt; 0.001). CF HAECs had significantly less SARS-CoV-2 viral titers than non-CF HAECs (n = 6, p = 0.0192). No difference in CPE was observed between groups. CA2 and CA12 protein levels were significantly increased in CF HAECs compared to non-CF HAECs (n = 6, p = 0.0094 and 0.0113, respectively). Conclusions: CF HAECs are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection that non-CF HAECs. This may be due to the increased intracellular pH in CF HAECs compared to non-CF HAECs. Since carbonic anhydrases produce bicarbonate ions, CA2 and CA12 upregulation may contribute to increased intracellular pH in CF along with decreased bicarbonate extrusion due to CFTR function loss.","output":"Cystic fibrosis airway cells are less susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection and have altered ph regulatory protein expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused many fatalities among people and significantly influenced the global economy.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades Ang II to angiotensin 1C7 (Ang (1-7)) and counter-regulates the classical axis of RAS. We have investigated the expression and distribution of ACE-2 in post-mortem human brain tissue in relation to AD pathology and classical RAS axis activity. METHODS: We measured ACE-2 activity by fluorogenic peptide substrate assay in mid-frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) in a cohort of AD (n = 90) and age-matched non-demented controls (n = 59) for which we have previous data on ACE-1 activity, amyloid  (A) level and tau pathology, as well as known ACE1 (rs1799752) indel polymorphism, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy severity scores. RESULTS: ACE-2 activity was significantly reduced in AD compared with age-matched controls (P < 0.0001) and correlated inversely with levels of A (r = ?0.267, P < 0.001) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology (r = ?0.327, P < 0.01). ACE-2 was reduced in individuals possessing an APOE 4 allele (P < 0.05) and was associated with ACE1 indel polymorphism (P < 0.05), with lower ACE-2 activity in individuals homozygous for the ACE1 insertion AD risk allele. ACE-2 activity correlated inversely with ACE-1 activity (r = ?0.453, P < 0.0001), and the ratio of ACE-1 to ACE-2 was significantly elevated in AD (P < 0.0001). Finally, we show that the ratio of Ang II to Ang (1C7) (a proxy measure of ACE-2 activity indicating conversion of Ang II to Ang (1C7)) is reduced in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings indicate that ACE-2 activity is reduced in AD and is an important regulator of the central classical ACE-1/Ang II/AT1R axis of RAS, and also that dysregulation of this pathway likely plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD.

Yet studies of resilience suggest most individuals will successfully negotiate this challenge and some may even experience growth and positive change. Some evidence suggests that the capacity to enact positive change in the face of adversity may be shaped by early life experiences. METHODS: In a subset of 374 participants (57% female, mean age = 29 years) in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), a longitudinal, birth cohort, prospective models were tested to determine whether early life adversities in family and neighborhood contexts predict positive change events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Childhood family and neighborhood contexts were assessed using a combination of self-report questionnaires and US Census data. Adulthood positive change events (e.g., becoming more appreciative of things usually taken for granted) were assessed using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII). RESULTS: In regression analyses, neighborhood disadvantage in childhood, measured both by objective and subjective assessments, predicted a higher number of positive change events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (? = .18, p = .004 and ? = .15, p = .006, respectively). Examination of the positive change event subscales showed neighborhood disadvantage in childhood predicted increases in events related to 'perspective taking and charitable giving' (? = .20, p = .022 and ? = .17, p = .002, respectively) and improved 'social relationships' (? = .18, p = .004 and ? = .13, p = .020, respectively), but not to positive 'health behaviors' (ps > .05). All associations were independent of sociodemographic factors and childhood family dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that neighborhood disadvantage in childhood may shape prosocial responses to stress in adulthood, potentially through early life adaptions to stress that are protective when facing adversity. There are several notable implications of the study findings. Although adversity in early life has clear negative impacts, it is possible that adversity experiences may also provide opportunities to develop adaptive strategies that foster resilience and growth when facing stress.

Materials and Methods In this study, a total of 36 patients undergoing aortic surgery using rRAP and standard cCPB were investigated. Measurements were performed at five time points: After induction of anesthesia, 5th minute of CPB, 10th minute of antegrade cerebral perfusion, 30th minute after declamping of aorta, and at sternum closure. Besides hemodynamic variables, arterial blood gas analysis and postoperative variables, patients were assessed for fHb levels.

Forecasting the long-term trend of the COVID-19 epidemic can help health authorities determine the transmission characteristics of the virus and take appropriate prevention and control strategies beforehand. Previous studies that solely applied traditional epidemic models or machine learning models were subject to underfitting or overfitting problems. We propose a new model named Dynamic-Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Quarantined (D-SEIQ), by making appropriate modifications of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) model and integrating machine learning based parameter optimization under epidemiological rational constraints. We used the model to predict the long-term reported cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in China from January 27, 2020. We evaluated our model on officially reported confirmed cases from three different regions in China, and the results proved the effectiveness of our model in terms of simulating and predicting the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. In China-Excluding-Hubei area within 7 days after the first public report, our model successfully and accurately predicted the long trend up to 40 days and the exact date of the outbreak peak. The predicted cumulative number (12,506) by March 10, 2020, was only 38% different from the actual number (13,005). The parameters obtained by our model proved the effectiveness of prevention and intervention strategies on epidemic control in China. The prediction results for five other countries suggested the external validity of our model. The integrated approach of epidemic and machine learning models could accurately forecast the long-term trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. The model parameters also provided insights into the analysis of COVID-19 transmission and the effectiveness of interventions in China.","output":"Forecasting the long-term trend of COVID-19 epidemic using a dynamic model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced educational programs, including pathology residency, to move to a physically distanced learning environment Tandem microscopic review (also known as double-scoping) of pathology slides is a traditional cornerstone of pathology education However, this requires the use of a double- or multi-headed optical light microscope which is unfortunately not amenable to physical distancing The loss of double-scoping has forced educational innovation in order to continue teaching microscopy Digital pathology options such as whole slide imaging could be considered;however, financial constraints felt by many departments often render this option cost-prohibitive Alternatively, a shift toward teaching via dynamic virtual microscopy offers a readily available, physically distanced, and cost-conscious alternative for pathology education Required elements include a standard light microscope, a mounted digital camera, computers, and videoconferencing software to share a slide image with the learner(s) Through survey data, we show immediate benefits include maintaining the essence of the traditional light microscope teaching experience, and additional gains were discovered such as the ability for educators and learners to annotate images in real time, among others Existing technology may not be initially optimized for a dynamic virtual experience, resulting in lag time with image movement, problems focusing, image quality issues, and a narrower field of view;however, these technological barriers can be overcome through hardware and software optimization Herein, we share the experience of establishing a dynamic virtual microscopy educational system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing readily available technology in the pathology department of a major academic medical center","output":"Using Dynamic Virtual Microscopy to Train Pathology Residents During the Pandemic: Perspectives on Pathology Education in the Age of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sheep pox, goat pox, and lumpy skin diseases are economically significant and contagious viral diseases of sheep, goats and cattle, respectively, caused by the genus Capripoxvirus (CaPV) of the family Poxviridae.

This disease poses challenges to food production and distribution, affecting rural livelihoods in most African countries, including Ethiopia. Transmission occurs mainly by direct or indirect contact with infected animals. They cause high morbidity (75-100% in endemic areas) and mortality (10-85%).

Here, we aimed to replicate findings of sleep timing delays and reduced social jetlag during lockdown using a large, regionally-diverse sample of participants from the United States (US). Further, we conducted exploratory analyses to determine if observed sleep changes were associated with age and self-reported chronotype. METHODS: A sample of 691 US adults (age 18-89) completed the Ultrashort Munich Chronotype Questionnaire twice during the same assessment: once querying retrospective memory for sleep patterns in the 6-weeks prior to February 1, 2020 (Pre-Lockdown) and a second time for sleep patterns in the 6-weeks prior to ~May 20th (Peak-Lockdown in the US). Participants also completed the abbreviated Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire to assess chronotype. We compared sleep duration (SDur), sleep onset time (SO), sleep end time (SEnd), social jetlag (SJL; difference between work-day and free-day sleep midpoint) and social sleep restriction (SSR; difference between work-day and free-day sleep duration) Pre- to Peak-Lockdown. We conducted exploratory analyses to determine whether Pre- to Peak-Lockdown changes in these sleep metrics were associated with age or chronotype. Main analyses were preregistered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/4a3fx). RESULTS: During the Peak-Lockdown period, participants, on average, reported significantly later SO and SEnd times and significantly reduced SJL and SSR compared with the Pre-Lockdown period. Change in SJL and SSR Pre- to Peak-Lockdown was significantly positively associated with age and chronotype such that SJL and SSR decreased more during lockdown in younger participants and those with an evening chronotype. CONCLUSION: Our results support lockdown-associated sleep timing delays and reduced SJL and SSR. Younger age and evening chronotype were associated with greater reductions in SJL and SSR during lockdown. These findings suggest that individuals, particularly young individuals and those with an evening chronotype, experience greatest desynchrony between intrinsic and social sleep timing when conforming to typical pre-pandemic social schedules.

The folding and unfolding kinetics and energy landscape of the hairpin were measured by ramping the force on the hairpin up and down, providing a detailed biophysical characterization. Unexpectedly, whereas unfolding reflected the simple two-state behavior typical of many hairpins, refolding was more complex, displaying significant heterogeneity. Evidence was found for multiple refolding pathways as well as previously unsuspected, partially folded intermediates. Measuring a variant mRNA containing only the sequence required to form the proposed triplex, it behaved largely in the same way. Nonetheless, very rarely, high-force unfolding events characteristic of pseudoknot-like structures were observed. The rare occurrence of the triplex suggests that the hairpin is the functional stimulatory structure.

The balance of protective versus pathological immune responses in COVID-19 is incompletely understood.

Here, we investigated the MAIT cell compartment in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe disease, as well as in convalescence. We show profound and preferential decline in MAIT cells in the circulation of patients with active disease paired with strong activation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses indicated significant MAIT cell enrichment and pro-inflammatory IL-17A bias in the airways. Unsupervised analysis identified MAIT cell CD69high and CXCR3low immunotypes associated with poor clinical outcome. MAIT cell levels normalized in the convalescent phase, consistent with dynamic recruitment to the tissues and later release back into the circulation when disease is resolved. These findings indicate that MAIT cells are engaged in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest their possible involvement in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","output":"MAIT cell activation and dynamics associated with COVID-19 disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In the literature, there exist plenty of research works focused on the detection and classification of breast cancer. However, only a few works have focused on the classification of breast cancer using ultrasound scan images. Although deep transfer learning models are useful in breast cancer classification, owing to their outstanding performance in a number of applications, image pre-processing and segmentation techniques are essential. In this context, the current study developed a new Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for the diagnosis and classification of breast cancer using ultrasound images. In the study, an optimal multi-level thresholding-based image segmentation technique was designed to identify the tumor-affected regions. The study also developed an ensemble of three deep learning models for feature extraction and an optimal machine learning classifier for breast cancer detection. The study offers a means of assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals in the breast cancer classification process. ABSTRACT: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) provide an efficient way to diagnose the presence of diseases such as breast cancer using ultrasound images (USIs). Globally, breast cancer is one of the major causes of increased mortality rates among women. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models are widely employed in the detection and classification of tumors in USIs. The CAD systems are designed in such a way that they provide recommendations to help radiologists in diagnosing breast tumors and, furthermore, in disease prognosis. The accuracy of the classification process is decided by the quality of images and the radiologists experience. The design of Deep Learning (DL) models is found to be effective in the classification of breast cancer. In the current study, an Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification (EDLCDS-BCDC) technique was developed using USIs. The proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique was intended to identify the existence of breast cancer using USIs. In this technique, USIs initially undergo pre-processing through two stages, namely wiener filtering and contrast enhancement. Furthermore, Chaotic Krill Herd Algorithm (CKHA) is applied with Kapurs entropy (KE) for the image segmentation process. In addition, an ensemble of three deep learning models, VGG-16, VGG-19, and SqueezeNet, is used for feature extraction. Finally, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is utilized to classify the images based on whether breast cancer exists or not. A wide range of simulations were carried out on benchmark databases and the extensive results highlight the better outcomes of the proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique over recent methods.","output":"Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification on Ultrasound Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It is unclear whether the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine leads to interactions in pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs). In this study, the influence of salvianolate and aspirin on metabolic enzymes, and the relationship between the blood concentration and pharmacodynamic indexes, were determined. METHOD In this, randomized, parallel-grouped, single-center clinical trial, 18 patients with coronary heart disease were randomly allocated into three groups: aspirin (AP) group, salvianolate (SV) group, and combination (A + S) group. All treatment courses lasted for 10 days, and blood samples were acquired before and after administration at different timepoints. The expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), CD62p, procaspase-activating compound 1 (PAC-1), P2Y12, phosphodiesterase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) were compared with variance analysis The blood concentrations were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS Sixteen subjects completed the study. No significant difference in COMT was found among groups, although there was a decrease in the SV group. The PK results indicated that the absorption time of salicylic acid was shortened and the AUC0- decreased and the elimination time of salvianolic acid B was prolonged and the AUC0- decreased. The PD results declined after administration. A significant difference was found in MAPK8, CD62p, and P2Y12 expression. Compared with the SV group, a significant difference in P2Y12 in the A + S group was found. CONCLUSION A pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was found in the aspirin and salvianolate combination. Pharmacodynamically, there was no difference between the A + S and AP groups. However, P2Y12 expression in the combination group was superior to that in the SV group.

Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements.

Subsequently, composting facilities are associated with high levels of A. fumigatus spores that are aerosolized from compost and cause respiratory illness in workers. In the UK, gardening is an activity enjoyed by individuals of all ages, and it is likely that they are being exposed to A. fumigatus spores when handling commercial compost or compost they have produced themselves. In the present study, 246 citizen scientists collected 509 soil samples from locations in their gardens in the UK, from which were cultured 5,174 A. fumigatus isolates. Of these isolates, 736 (14%) were resistant to tebuconazole: the third most-sprayed triazole fungicide in the UK, which confers cross-resistance to the medical triazoles used to treat A. fumigatus lung infections in humans. These isolates were found to contain the common resistance mechanisms in the A. fumigatus cyp51A gene TR(34)/L98H or TR(46)/Y121F/T289A, as well as the less common resistance mechanisms TR(34), TR(53), TR(46)/Y121F/T289A/S363P/I364V/G448S, and (TR(46))(2)/Y121F/M172I/T289A/G448S. Regression analyses found that soil samples containing compost were significantly more likely to grow tebuconazole-susceptible and tebuconazole-resistant A. fumigatus strains than those that did not and that compost samples grew significantly higher numbers of A. fumigatus than other samples. IMPORTANCE The findings presented here highlight compost as a potential health hazard to individuals with predisposing factors to A. fumigatus lung infections and as a potential health hazard to immunocompetent individuals who could be exposed to sufficiently high numbers of spores to develop infection. Furthermore, we found that 14% of A. fumigatus isolates in garden soils were resistant to an agricultural triazole, which confers cross-resistance to medical triazoles used to treat A. fumigatus lung infections. This raises the question of whether compost bags should carry additional health warnings regarding inhalation of A. fumigatus spores, whether individuals should be advised to wear facemasks while handling compost, or whether commercial producers should be responsible for sterilizing compost before shipping. The findings support increasing public awareness of the hazard posed by compost and investigating measures that can be taken to reduce the exposure risk.","output":"Citizen Science Surveillance of Triazole-Resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in United Kingdom Residential Garden Soils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute enteric disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).

Antibody reagents that are specific for cotton rat immunoglobulins have not been described. To enhance the usefulness of this model, four immunoglobulins in Sigmodon serum were characterized (IgG1, IgG2, IgA, IgM) and antisera specific for each immunoglobulin were made. Sera from three different species of Sigmodon were examined, S. hispidus (SH), S. arizoni (SA) and S. fulviventer (SF). Although IgA and IgM appeared similar in all three species, the IgG were expressed differently because normal serum levels of IgG2 were deficient in SH when compared with SA and SF and to other rodents. Similarly, IgG2 antibody response to purified protein antigen was deficient in SH although the IgG1 antibody response was superior to that in SF and SA. The three cotton rat species were infected with respiratory syncytial virus, and the kinetics of the antibody response was measured.

The sampling sites were from the wastewater treatment plant outlets to the downstream drinking water treatment plant intakes. Total residual chlorine and DBPs (dichloromethane and trichloromethane) detected in the river water ranged from 0 to 0.84 mg/L and 0 to 0.034 mg/L, respectively. The residual chlorine and DBPs showed a gradual reduction pattern related to water flow, and the concentration at intakes did not exceed the Chinese drinking water source quality standards. Phytoplankton and zooplankton densities were not significantly correlated with residual chlorine and DBPs. The fluctuations in phytoplankton resource use efficiency (RUE) and zooplankton RUE in the Fuhe River, with the highest residual chlorine, and the Qinglinghe River with the highest DBPs, were higher than those in the Hanjiang River.

Cox proportional hazard regression models, stratified by tumor type and stage, were fit evaluating use of bDMARDs as a time fixed and time varying covariate. RESULTS We identified 431 RA patients with solid malignancies: 111 (26%) received bDMARDs after their cancer diagnosis. Median OS from cancer diagnosis was 16.1 years. Of the patients receiving bDMARDs, most had localized disease, and only 14 (13%) had advanced cancer. In the stratified Cox models no statistically significant differences were observed between patients who received tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) or patients who received nonTNFi, compared with those who did not receive bDMARDs (hazard ratio (HR), 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31, 1.44; HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.26, 4.60 respectively).

BACKGROUND: COVID\\\\19 vaccination has started in most European countries with healthcare personnel being the first group receiving the vaccine shots. Their attitude towards vaccination is of paramount significant as their role in the frontline could help in the awareness of general population. METHODS: A study was conducted in Albania, Cyprus, Greece, Spain and Kosovo with the use of an online questionnaire. The Fear of COVID\\\\19 Scale was used. The STROBE checklist was followed for this cross\\\\sectional study. RESULTS: Study population consisted of 1135 nurses. Mean age of the participants was 38.3 years, while most of them were female gender (84.7%) and married (53.1%). Acceptance of a safe and effective COVID\\\\19 vaccine was higher among Greek (79.2%) and Spanish (71.6%) nurses, followed by Cypriot (54%), Albanian (46.3%) and Kosovo (46.2%) nurses. Key factors for willingness to get vaccinated were male gender, living in a country with a high mortality rate in comparison with low mortality, being not infected with COVID\\\\19, having high level of knowledge about COVID\\\\19 vaccines and having been vaccinated for influenza in the last 2 years. Moreover, trusting the government and doctors regarding the information about the COVID\\\\19 and having high level of fear about this virus were key factors for willingness to get vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Vaccination of healthcare personnel is a crucial issue not only for their own safety but also for their patients.

Additionally, many ACP initiatives fail to integrate directly into the electronic health record (EHR), resulting in infrequent and disorganized documentation. Objective To determine whether a nurse navigator-led ACP pathway combined with a health care professional-facing EHR interface improves the occurrence of ACP discussions and their documentation within the EHR. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a randomized effectiveness trial using the Zelen design, in which patients are randomized prior to informed consent, with only those randomized to the intervention subsequently approached to provide informed consent. Randomization began November 1, 2018, and follow-up concluded November 1, 2019. The study population included patients 65 years or older with multimorbidity combined with either cognitive or physical impairments, and/or frailty, assessed from 8 primary care practices in North Carolina. Interventions Participants were randomized to either a nurse navigator-led ACP pathway (n = 379) or usual care (n = 380). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was documentation of a new ACP discussion within the EHR. Secondary outcomes included the usage of ACP billing codes, designation of a surrogate decision maker, and ACP legal form documentation. Exploratory outcomes included incident health care use. Results Among 759 randomized patients (mean age 77.7 years, 455 women [59.9%]), the nurse navigator-led ACP pathway resulted in a higher rate of ACP documentation (42.2% vs 3.7%, P < .001) as compared with usual care. The ACP billing codes were used more frequently for patients randomized to the nurse navigator-led ACP pathway (25.3% vs 1.3%, P < .001). Patients randomized to the nurse navigator-led ACP pathway more frequently designated a surrogate decision maker (64% vs 35%, P < .001) and completed ACP legal forms (24.3% vs 10.0%, P < .001). During follow-up, the incidence of emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations was similar between the randomized groups (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.92-1.50). Conclusions and Relevance A nurse navigator-led ACP pathway integrated with a health care professional-facing EHR interface increased the frequency of ACP discussions and their documentation.

Virulent NDV strains (GM) induce large quantities of interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is the central mediator of the inflammatory reaction. Excessive expression of IL-1 exacerbates inflammatory damage. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced IL-1 expression can aid in further understanding the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease. Here, we showed that anti-IL-1 neutralizing antibody treatment decreased body temperature and mortality following infection with virulent NDV. We further explored the primary molecules involved in NDV-induced IL-1 expression from the perspective of both the host and virus. This study showed that overexpression of NLRP3 resulted in increased IL-1 expression, whereas inhibition of NLRP3 or caspase-1 caused a significant reduction in IL-1 expression, indicating that the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis is involved in NDV-induced IL-1 expression. Moreover, ultraviolet-inactivated GM (chicken/Guangdong/GM/2014) NDV failed to induce the expression of IL-1. We then collected virus from GM-infected cell culture supernatant using ultracentrifugation, extracted the viral RNA, and stimulated the cells further with GM RNA. The results revealed that RNA alone was capable of inducing IL-1 expression. Moreover, NLRP3/caspase-1 was involved in GM RNA-induced IL-1 expression. Thus, our study elucidated the critical role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease while also demonstrating that inhibition of IL-1 via anti-IL-1 neutralizing antibodies decreased the damage associated with NDV infection; furthermore, GM RNA induced IL-1 expression via NLRP3/caspase-1.","output":"Newcastle disease virus RNA-induced IL-1 expression via the NLRP3/caspase-1 inflammasome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic, declared on March 11, 2020, constitute an extraordinary health, social and economic global challenge. The impact on people's mental health is expected to be high. This paper sought to systematically review community-based studies on depression conducted during the COVID-19 and estimate the pooled prevalence of depression. METHOD: We searched for cross-sectional, community-based studies listed on PubMed or Web of Science from January 1, 2020 to May 8, 2020 that reported prevalence of depression. A random effect model was used to estimate the pooled proportion of depression. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis, with prevalence rates of depression ranging from 7.45% to 48.30%. The pooled prevalence of depression was 25% (95% CI: 18% ? 33%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 99.60%, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a global estimated prevalence of depression of 3.44% in 2017, our pooled prevalence of 25% appears to be 7 times higher, thus suggesting an important impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people's mental health.

However, most tissue available for research is from diseased liver, and the results of hepatocyte isolation from such tissue are inferior compared with normal tissue. Liberase and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have been shown separately to improve viability of isolated hepatocytes. This study aims to determine the effect of Liberase and NAC in combination on human hepatocyte isolation from normal and diseased liver tissues. METHODS Hepatocytes were isolated from 30 liver specimens through the use of a standard collagenase digestion technique (original protocol) and another 30 with the addition of NAC and standard collagenase substituted by Liberase (new protocol). Viability and success, defined as maintenance of cell adhesion and morphology for 48 hours, were assessed. Metabolic function was assessed by means of albumin and urea synthesis. RESULTS Baseline factors were similar for both groups. The delay to tissue processing was slightly shorter in the new protocol group (median, 2 versus 4 hours; P = 0.007). The success rate improved from 12 of 30 (40.0%) to 21 of 30 (70.0%) with the use of the new protocol (P = 0.037), and median viable cell yield increased from 7.3  10(4) to 28.3  10(4) cells/g tissue (P = 0.003).

Anakinra (100mg every 8 hours for 3 days, with tapering) alone or in combination with GC (i.v. methylprednisolone, 1-2 mg/kg daily, with tapering). Standard of care (SOC) treatment was: hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin with or without antivirals and anticoagulants. Late rescue AIT with anakinra or tocilizumab was also evaluated. Treatment effect on Overall Survival (OS) was assessed by a Propensity Score adjusted Cox model. RESULTS: 128 patients were analyzed; 63 received early AIT (30 anakinra, 33 anakinra and CG) at admission; 65 patients (44 with SOC, 21 SOC plus late rescue AIT) did not and were used as controls. After adjusting for all the unbalanced baseline covariates, early AIT reduced the hazard of mortality by 74% (adjusted HR=0.26, p<0.001).

Competition between the new elements and older ones with a similar semantic or grammatical function may lead to speakers preferring one of them, and leaving the other to go out of use. We introduce a general method for quantifying competition between linguistic elements in diachronic corpora which does not require language-specific resources other than a sufficiently large corpus. This approach is readily applicable to a wide range of languages and linguistic subsystems. Here, we apply it to lexical data in five corpora differing in language, type, genre, and time span. We find that changes in communicative need are consistently predictive of lexical competition dynamics. Near-synonymous words are more likely to directly compete if they belong to a topic of conversation whose importance to language users is constant over time, possibly leading to the extinction of one of the competing words. By contrast, in topics which are increasing in importance for language users, near-synonymous words tend not to compete directly and can coexist. This suggests that, in addition to direct competition between words, language change can be driven by competition between topics or semantic subspaces.","output":"Communicative need modulates competition in language change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasingly, firms need to cope with challenges related to sustainability and ecological transformation while also experiencing an ongoing transformation by implementing New Work forms, a trend even more accelerated by the Covid 19 pandemic.

Aside from its implications on the community as a whole, COVID-19 has also been associated with a variety of mental health problems among healthcare workers (HCWs). In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs in central Ethiopia. Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from June 25, 2020, to July 25, 2020, in Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-reported Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were cleaned, coded, and analysed using SPSS Version 23. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify the associated factors for mental health outcomes at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results: A total of 816 HCWs completed the self-report questionnaire. The percentage of HCWs who had moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were 60.3%, 78%, and 33.8%, respectively. Female participants, HCWs in the Oromiya Special Zone, medical laboratory professionals, and HCWs working in the COVID-19 treatment isolation centers were significantly more likely to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusion: In this study, HCWs reported a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Female participants, HCWs in the Oromiya Special Zone, medical laboratory professionals, and HCWs working in the COVID-19 treatment isolation centers were significantly more likely to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. It is imperative that the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health should develop psychological interventions to address the specific needs of HCWs who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Self-Reported Symptoms of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Healthcare Workers in Ethiopia During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing global presence of and reliance on smartphones, featuring high-resolution digital photography and wireless, high-speed Internet, patients with wounds and point-of-care wound professionals are increasingly engaged in remote wound management and surveillance. Twenty years ago, home wound care professionals, advised by remote experts using telemedicine, were achieving sterling chronic wound outcomes. Mobile technology has sharply reduced transportation costs compared with clinic visits. Registered nurses using smartphones to access a web-based surgical infection site (SIS) surveillance algorithm based on validated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, extended reliable, valid SIS surveillance into the first month of home care as recommended in the guidelines. This improved timely SIS identification and management while generating a registry that motivated patients and caregivers. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic accelerated needs for evidence-based care delivered by telemedicine, empowering wound care professionals to deliver quality care while limiting risks associated with patient contact. This installment of Evidence Corner reviews 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that used telehealth in varying ways to improve health care delivery and outcomes. One reported use of a telehealth application is to improve patient knowledge and outcomes of diabetic foot care.

It is done to maintain plasma concentration of the drug under therapy within a specific target range for maximum therapeutic efficacy without unnecessary exposure to adverse effects. Objective This study aims to evaluate necessity of therapeutic drug monitoring in Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and Lamotrigine therapy among epileptic patients. Method A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of one year at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal. After taking detailed history, blood samples were collected from epileptic patients on monotherapy with the selected drugs. Plasma levels of these drugs were analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique (HPLC). Out of total 42 selected patients, 21 were tested for phenytoin, 17 for carbamazepine and four for lamotrigine. The result was categorized into therapeutic, sub-therapeutic and above-therapeutic groups based on reference range. Result Out of total 21 samples tested for phenytoin, 15(71.4%) had plasma drug level within therapeutic range, 5(23.8%) had within subtherapeutic range and 1(4.8%) had above therapeutic range. Analysis of carbamazepine plasma level showed 14(82.3%) at therapeutic level, 1(5.9%) at sub-therapeutic level and 2(11.8%) at above-therapeutic level. Lamotrigine testing in four samples showed 2(50% in) both within therapeutic range and above-therapeutic range. Conclusion Therapeutic drug monitoring of phenytoin, carbamazepine and lamotrigine showed variation in plasma level irrespective of the therapeutic dose.

We sought to objectively identify trends in internet search queries on public concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine side effects on fertility that might impact vaccine uptake. We used Google Trends to investigate queries in Google's Search Engine relating to the coronavirus vaccine and fertility between 10/24/2020 and 1/27/2021.

Historically, the lack of red giants in the Galactic center was discovered via the drop in the strength of the CO absorption bandhead by Kris Sellgren et al. (1990), later followed by the stellar number counts based on the high angular resolution near-infrared observations. Several mechanisms were put forward that could have led to the preferential depletion of bright red giants: star-star collisions, tidal stripping, star-accretion disc collisions, or an infall of a massive cluster or a secondary black hole. Here we propose a novel scenario for the bright red-giant depletion based on the collisions between red giants and the nuclear jet, which was likely active in the Galactic center a few million years ago and could have led to the formation of the large-scale $\\\\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles. The process of the jet-induced ablation of red giants appears to be most efficient within $\\\\sim 0.04\\\\,{\\\\rm pc}$ (S-cluster), while at larger distances it was complemented by star-accretion disc collisions and at smaller scales, tidal stripping operated.

The majority of eligible college students with disabilities do not register with their campus disability service to receive accommodations or supports. Among those who do utilize disability services, findings have been mixed regarding the relation between service use and students' academic outcomes. Further, few studies have measured the use of disability services over time. The current study used secondary data to examine the relation between accommodation use and academic outcomes of undergraduate students with disabilities (N = 1980) who registered with the campus disability service during a 4-year study period. Descriptive findings for academic and accommodation use patterns are discussed with regard to gender, race/ethnicity, and disability type. Regression analyses showed that earlier registration with the disability service and longer duration of service use predicted more positive student outcomes, as measured by cumulative GPA and time to graduation. Continued accommodation use also positively predicted within-subject changes in students' semester GPAs across the study period. However, services appear to be under-utilized, with 25% of participants only using accommodations for a single semester across the study period.

Food store businesses were not limited by the restrictions and people had to purchase food; however, national and local rules limited citizens' movements, potentially leading to a different choices of transportation means than before the pandemic. The results show that both the lockdown and, perhaps, the fear of contagion, moved the preferences of people from public and shared means to foot and private vehicles.

The level of privacy incorporated into an app is largely based on the societal norms and values of a particular country. Digital health technologies can be highly effective and preserve privacy at the same time, but in the case of contact tracing and exposure notification apps, there is a trade-off between increased privacy measures and the effectiveness of the app. In this article, examples from various countries are used to highlight how characteristics of contract tracing and exposure notification apps contribute to the perceived levels of privacy awarded to citizens and how this impacts an app's effectiveness.

The present study investigated how the lockdown has impacted the physiological and psychological well-being of children with Fragile X-Syndrome (FXS), aged from 2 to 16 years, and their mothers. In an online survey, 48 mothers of FXS children reported their perception of self-efficacy as caregivers and, at the same time, their childrens sleep habits, behavioral and emotional difficulties during, and retrospectively, before the lockdown. Results showed a general worsening of sleep quality, and increasing behavioral problems. Although mothers reported a reduction in external support, their perception of self-efficacy as caregivers did not change during the home confinement compared to the period before.

While the protection offered by vaccines (and booster doses) offers a method of mitigating the worst effects, by the end of 2021 the distribution of vaccine was highly heterogeneous with some countries achieving over 90% coverage in adults by the end of 2021, while others have less than 2%. In part, this is due to the availability of sufficient vaccine, although vaccine hesitancy also plays a role. Methods: We use an age-structured model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, matched to national data from 152 countries, to investigate the global impact of different vaccine sharing protocols during 2021. We assume a direct relationship between the emergence of variants with increased transmissibility and the cumulative amount of global infection, such that lower global prevalence leads to a lower reproductive number within each country. We compare five vaccine sharing scenarios, from the current situation, through sharing once a particular within-country threshold is reached (e.g. all over 40s have received 2 doses), to full sharing where all countries achieve equal age-dependent vaccine deployment. Findings: Compared to the observed distribution of vaccine uptake, we estimate full vaccine sharing would have generated a 1.5% (PI -0.1 - 4.5%) reduction in infections and a 11.3% (PI 0.6 - 23.2%) reduction in mortality globally by January 2022. The greatest benefit of vaccine sharing would have been experienced by low and middle income countries, who see an average 5.2% (PI 2.5% - 10.4%) infection reduction and 26.8% (PI 24.1% - 31.3%) mortality reduction. Many high income countries, that have had high vaccine uptake (most notably Canada, Chile, UK and USA), suffer increased infections and mortality under most of the sharing protocols investigated, assuming no other counter measures had been taken. However, if reductions in vaccine supply in these countries had been offset by prolonged use of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, we predict far greater reductions in global infection and mortality of 64.5% (PI 62.6% - 65.4%) and 62.8% (PI 44.0% - 76.3%), respectively. Interpretation: By itself, our results suggest that although more equitable vaccine distribution would have had limited impact on overall infection numbers, vaccine sharing would have substantially reduced global mortality by providing earlier protection of the most vulnerable. If increased vaccine sharing from high income nations had been combined with slower easing of non pharmaceutical interventions to compensate for this, a large reduction in both infection and mortality globally would be expected, confounded by a lower risk of new variants arising.","output":"The impacts of increased global vaccine sharing on the COVID-19 pandemic; a retrospective modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on sport entrepreneurship and service-dominated logic theory, this paper explores the association between networks, value co-creation and crises in the articulation of sport entrepreneurial ecosystems.

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of SG, RYGB, and OAGB, on short- and long-term weight loss and comorbidities resolution. METHODS A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB, and OAGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: those patients undergoing SG, those ones undergoing RYGB and those ones undergoing OAGB. BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HT), and dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed. RESULTS 600 patients were included in the study, 200 in each group. Follow-up rate at 5 years postoperatively was 91% in SG group, 92% in RYGB, and 90% in OAGB. OAGB achieves significantly greater EBMIL than RYGB and SG at 1, 2, and 5 years (p < 0.001, respectively). At 5 years, OAGB achieves significantly greater remission of T2DM (p = 0.027), HT (p = 0.006), and DL (p < 0.001) than RYGB and SG. RYGB did not show significant superiority than SG in short- and long-term remission of T2DM and HT, but achieves greater remission of DL (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION OAGB achieves superior mid- and long-term weight loss than RYGB and SG. There are no significant differences in weight loss between SG and RYGB at 1, 2, and 5 years. OAGB achieves better short- and long-term resolution rates of DM, HT, and DL than SG and RYGB.

This may have increased the number of hours spent online and could have impacted the quality of the enacted behavior, in terms of loss of control of Internet use. In this online survey, we were interested in measure how much loss of control was perceived regarding online gambling, online shopping, the fruition of online pornographic content and web navigation. Design and methods: The online survey was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in the post-lockdown and 1232 subjects participated in the survey. In the participating sample, healthcare workers (HW) were 43.1% of the sample, of which 18.7% were directly involved in the Coronavirus emergency, and 52.3% of the sample is not a HW. Only 0.6% of the sample gambled online and 37.5% of those reported losing control of their gambling mode. Most of the sample shopped online during the LD (70.1%), but only 7.2% of those lost control by buying and/or spending more than what they had set themselves. Results: Significant data emerged showing that those who lost control while online shopping also lost control regarding the amount of time spent online (p<0.001); 21.6% of the sample, reported making use of online pornographic material during LD, 4.7% of them stated that the frequency increased and 5.1% reported losing control by having spent more money or more time than what was intended. Finally, 44.7% of the sample have experienced loss of control during the web navigation. Furthermore, during the LD 67.8% of the sample reports having experienced unpleasant emotions. Of these, 8.4% state that they enacted behaviors such as online gambling, online shopping, online pornographic material viewing and web navigation to counter their negative emotions. Interestingly, we found a correlation between loss of control during web navigation and online shopping and the emotional states upset, scared and restless (p<0.05). Conclusion: To conclude, there was no significant increase in potentially addictive behaviors, nor an increase in loss of control of these behaviors when enacted online. However, the loss of control in online shopping and web navigation was significantly correlated to the unpleasant emotional states of nervousness, fear and restlessness, whereas those who reported feeling strong and able to handle the situation experienced a lower loss of control in their web navigation. These correlations may suggest that these online behaviors may act as modulators of unpleasant emotional states.","output":"COVID-19 lockdown: Impact on online gambling, online shopping, web navigation and online pornography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the number of users and the demand for live-streaming services have increased.

Rapid and precise diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63 C) for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified and detected in a one-step and single-tube reaction, and the detection results were easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swab samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinical samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: Data from the 2020 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey were analyzed. A total of 54948 adolescents responded to the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) for the assessment of their anxiety severity as well as to the mental health and health risk behavior survey. Logistic regression analysis, t tests, and variance analysis of a complex sample general linear model were used to examine the association of anxiety severity with health behaviors and mental health. RESULTS: After statistical adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, the subjects in the severe anxiety group were significantly more likely to be current smokers (odds ratio [OR]: 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72C2.50), current drinkers (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.67C2.19), experience habitual substance use (OR: 10.89, 95% CI: 8.22C14.42), have sexual intercourse (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.76C2.51), and have unprotected intercourse (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.67C2.92) than those in the normal group. Anxiety severity negatively correlated with sleep satisfaction and happiness, but positively correlated with stress perception, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. CONCLUSION: Adolescent anxiety is associated with health risk behaviors and poor mental health. Thus, early screening and intervention for anxiety in adolescents could contribute to the management and coping of youth health risk behaviors in the community.","output":"The Association of Anxiety Severity With Health Risk Behaviors in a Large Representative Sample of Korean Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biospecimen repositories play a vital role in enabling investigation of biologic mechanisms, identification of disease-related biomarkers, advances in diagnostic assays, recognition of microbial evolution, and characterization of new therapeutic targets for intervention.

Endoscopic dissection was performed to expose the lamina papyracea, ethmoid roof, sphenoid roof, and frontal sinus. Cautery was applied to the frontal sinus of goat heads, and temperatures were measured via thermocouple sensors placed along the intracranial skull base. Surgical instruments studied included monopolar, bipolar, and endoscopic bipolar devices at various power settings. RESULTS Temperature increase, as averaged across all cautery powers and measurement positions, was highest for the monopolar cautery (17.55 C) when compared with the bipolar and endoscopic bipolar devices (<2 C for bipolar, Endo-Pen, Stammberger, and Wormald; P < .001). Monopolar cautery reached 30.86 C at high power when averaged over all positions (P < .001) as compared with <3 C for the other instruments. Temperatures rose as power of cautery was increased from low to medium and high. Temperatures decreased as the distance of the thermocouple sensor probe from the cautery origin increased. CONCLUSION Thermal conductance across the skull base varies depending on equipment and power of cautery, with monopolar resulting in the largest temperature increase.

Here, we analyze the air pollution, human health, carbon emissions, and water consumption impacts under a set of planning strategies to prepare for potentially fully disrupted natural gas imports in China. We find that, with China's current natural gas storage capacity, compensating for natural gas import disruptions using domestic fossil fuels (with the current average combustion technology) could lead up to 23,300 (95% CI: 22,100-24,500) excess premature deaths from air pollution, along with increased carbon emissions and aggravated water stress. Improving energy efficiency, more progressive electrification and decarbonization, cleaner fossil combustion, and expanding natural gas storage capacity can significantly reduce the number of excess premature deaths and may offer opportunities to reduce negative carbon and water impacts simultaneously. Our results highlight the importance for China to increase the domestic storage capacity in the short term, and more importantly, to promote a clean energy transition to avoid potentially substantial environmental consequences under intensifying geopolitical uncertainties in China.

Many of these assays have been launched by various manufacturers. Unfortunately, the new FDA emergency use regulations have resulted in a situation where laboratories have to perform their own validation studies. Numerous of these labs do not have the biobank needed to carry the studies out. Methods In this paper, we introduce a method that allows institutions to quickly perform a verifiation study in a low-prevalence infection situation. As proof of concept, we used the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA assay and an SAP-based hospital information system. The Shenzhen YHLO Biotech IgM and IgG assay targetting other surface patterns, was used as confirmatory test. Results The Roche assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 0.069 COI (cutoff index) and successfully passed the performance validation according to CLSI EP15-A3. The study population of 627 in-patients exhibited an age median of 64 years and approximately 13% of the group were under intensive care at the respective time point. All included patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR (cobas 6800?, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Only one false positive result was obtained, resulting in a specificity for the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test of 99.84% and a negative predictive value of 99.98%. Conclusions The anonymized use of residual material enables quick evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, as shown in this work with the Roche Elecsys assay. Comparison of the control population with economic data makes it possible to validate the sampling set and therefore to determine diagnostic specificity. Using the chosen approach, it was shown that the Roche test achieved very good results in terms of diagnostic specificity, reproducibility and limit of detection.","output":"Specificity testing by point prevalence as a simple assessment strategy using the Roche Elecsys?

Such a strategy should rely on disparate diagnostic tests to prevent a slowdown in testing due to lack of materials and reagents imposed by supply chain problems, which happened at the beginning of the pandemic. In this study, we have established a single-tube test based on RT-LAMP that enables the visual detection of less than 100 viral genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 within 30 min. We benchmarked the assay against the gold standard test for COVID-19 diagnosis, RT-PCR, using 177 nasopharyngeal RNA samples. For viral loads above 100 copies, the RT-LAMP assay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96.1%. Additionally, we set up a RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples, albeit with lower sensitivity. The saliva was self-collected and the collection tube remained closed until inactivation, thereby ensuring the protection of the testing personnel. As expected, RNA extraction from saliva samples increased the sensitivity of the test. To lower the costs associated with RNA extraction, we performed this step using an alternative protocol that uses plasmid DNA extraction columns. We also produced the enzymes needed for the assay and established an in-house-made RT-LAMP test independent of specific distribution channels. Finally, we developed a new colorimetric method that allowed the detection of LAMP products by the visualization of an evident color shift, regardless of the reaction pH.","output":"A molecular test based on RT-LAMP for rapid, sensitive and inexpensive colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thymidine phosphorylase (TP), also known as platelet\\\\derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD\\\\ECGF), is an enzyme, which is upregulated in a wide variety of solid tumors including breast and colorectal cancers.

This series aims to expose undergraduate and medical students to IR physician perspectives of a typical day. As IR continues to grow as a specialty, it is essential to promote awareness and recruit future generations of physicians to this innovative field [1,2]. Currently, it is difficult for undergraduate and medical students to shadow IRs in hospitals, depending on COVID-19 protocol, so the video series gives students a glimpse at what an IR does. For the series, several residents and attendings were invited to create video content for the IR Education YouTube channel run by the SIR RFS. Materials and Methods: A template and instructions for the video series were provided to the participating physicians. The interventional radiologists were asked to take approximately 5 minutes of video footage consisting of an introduction, their type of practice, their day-to-day schedule, and a tour of their facility. They can add any additional information they would like, such as procedures, devices, why they chose IR, and current lifestyle. Notably, the physicians have the flexibility to make the video unique to their preference. To aid in the video-making process, medical students involved in this project will complete video editing, such as adding music and clip transitions with the footage submissions. We will survey undergraduate and medical students to gauge if the YouTube series sparked interest in the field of IR. Additionally, our survey can identify specific topics or content sought out by viewing students to incorporate those into future videos.

Furthermore, the interaction within a community and interaction outside the community is modeled. The constraint with respect to interaction has been implemented by a machine learning type algorithm and becomes the unique part of our study . Using this model, the maximum healthcare threshold is fixed as a constraint.

CONCLUSION: Critical care nurses and multidisciplinary teams often care for patients with a tracheostomy who are known or suspected to have COVID-19. Appropriate care of these patients relies on safeguarding the health care team. The practices described in this review may greatly reduce risk of infectious transmission.","output":"Critical Care Guidance for Tracheostomy Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global, Multidisciplinary Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevance. There is limited evidence on the effect of various vaccines on the human reproductive system. Potential adverse effects of vaccines on fertility are associated with autoimmune disorders, which might cause gonadal damage. Currently, several studies are underway investigating the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on human fertility. To our best knowledge, there is only one study published which demonstrated no adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccine on assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Aim. To investigate the effect of the Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine on ovarian reserve and antiphospholipid antibody level in reproductive-age women. Materials and methods. The prospective study included 51 women vaccinated against COVID-19 with Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine. The inclusion criteria were age from 18 to 45, preserved menstrual function, normal ovarian reserve, no history of COVID-19, negative PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 and negative SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test before vaccination, no pregnancy, and no history of serious illnesses. Clinical evaluation was carried out twice-immediately before immunization and 90 days after the first vaccine component administration. The antral follicle count was measured by pelvic ultrasound. Serum levels of AMH, FSH, TSH, estradiol, antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) M and G isotypes against cardiolipin (aCL), 2-glycoprotein-1 (a2-GP-1), annexin V (aAn V), phosphatidylserine (aPS), and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Results. There were no significant changes in hormones levels and antral follicle counts before and after vaccination, including in women of advanced reproductive age (37 years). After immunization, aPL antibody levels did not differ significantly from the baseline. There was no correlation between aPL antibody level dynamics and level of FSH and AMH, which indirectly demonstrates no possible autoimmune effect of vaccination on women's fertility. Conclusion. This is the first study investigating the effect of the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine on ovarian reserve parameters and aPL antibody levels. The preliminary results prove that the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine in women of reproductive age does not adversely impact ovarian reserve.","output":"Gam-covid-vac (Sputnik v) vaccine has no adverse effect on ovarian reserve in reproductive-age women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some patients and families of color, including Asian Americans, face significant adverse stressors due to living within a White-dominant society Xenophobia and racism can impact health Research evidence points to early exposure to adverse childhood experiences such as racial discrimination as being detrimental and having significant short-term and long-term impact on physical and mental health The purpose of this commentary article is to illuminate the need of patients and their families who may seek health care providers (HCPs) to express their concerns and fears when issues of xenophobia and racism arise Patients and families need space in a healthcare setting to feel heard and understood Anti-Asian xenophobia and racism among medically underserved Asian Americans persists and has been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic We describe tenets of Critical Race Theory and AsianCrit, and use this lens to understand an example actual scenario, a counter-story, of a Vietnamese mother, and her Vietnamese-Chinese American family's experience with xenophobia and racism at a community recreation center and the subsequent communication of this experience with a HCP We describe the impacts of these experiences of seeking healing including discontinuity of a HCP-patient-family relationship It takes bravery for patients and families to tell their story of xenophobia and racism to a HCP There are Asian Americans who are afraid to seek healthcare because of anti-Asian xenophobia and concerns about White fragility Following, we highlight research evidence on implicit bias, also known as unconscious bias, as context about its persistent and widespread existence among healthcare professionals in general and the need to address this in healthcare Implicit bias can influence care provided to a patient-family and the interactions between a HCP-patient-family We include additional resources such as those from the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, American Psychological Association Office on Children Youth and Families, the Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs, the Office on Socioeconomic Status, and American Academy of Pediatrics to consider in support of equity in healthcare practice of children and their families","output":"Deconstructing Racialized Experiences in Healthcare: What a Missed Opportunity for Healing Looks Like and Healthcare Resources for Children and Their Families"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) in children has been hampered by difficulty in obtaining convalescent serum and time constraints. In this study, the two diagnostic assays that targeted respectively on Mp-antibody and Mp-DNA were retrospectively investigated. METHODS: A total of 3146 children were clinically diagnosed to have CAP and were confirmed by chest X-ray during March 2015 to February 2016 in Childrens hospital of Hebei Province (China). Both of the sera and sputum samples were collected in 24 h after their admission. The Mp-antibody was examined by the passive particle agglutination assay and a fourfold or greater increase of antibody titers of paired sera orR1:160 titer of single serum was set as the serology positive. Mp-DNA in the sputum samples was tested by a multiplex-PCR method named GeXP assay (multiplex PCR combined with automated capillary electrophoresis). In order to eliminate the false positive results caused by the asymptomatic carriage after infected by M. pneumoniae, the inconsistent samples were tested by the real-time isothermal transcription-mediated RNA amplification assay (SAT). RESULTS: The inter-rated agreement test was performed in 3146 CAP patients, with a highest kappa value in the school-age children as 0.783. There were 6.29% (198/3146) cases showed inconsistent results determined by GeXP and serology assay. All of the 19 GeXP(+)/Serology (?) samples and a randomly chosen 27 from 179 GeXP(?)/Serology (+) samples were tested by SAT assay, and a 97.8% diagnosis agreement was observed between SAT and GeXP assay, but not with the serology assay. In addition, patients who were detected only by serology or only by multiplex-PCR were significantly younger than those with both methods positive (3.0 and 1.5 years vs. 5.0 years, p < 0.01). The Viral-Mp coinfection accounted for 37.0% (97/262), which was more common in winter and spring (p < 0.05) and in the infantile group (p < 0.01), compared to the pure Mp positive ones. CONCLUSION: In some children CAP cases, the Mp laboratory diagnosis was inconsistent between serology and multiplex-PCR assay. Verified by the SAT assay, the GeXP showed a more sensitive and reliable performance compared with the serology assay. Furthermore, employing the multiplex-PCR could provide more information on the associated pathogens for clinical assessment of CAP.

At the Bristol Royal Infirmary, an innercity teaching hospital that manages patients aged 16 and over, we present our response to these projected changes in ED attendances, with the initiation of the incident triage area (ITA). The ITA is a triage station situated outside the ED and staffed by a senior clinician, healthcare assistant and patient flow coordinator. It receives patients presenting as walk-in or via ambulance, and on their arrival aims to establish their risk of COVID-19 and their acuity of illness. This allows for triage of the patient to one of the four zones of the hospital, as well as providing clinical guidance on any initial interventions that patients may require. The benefits of the ITA are that it enables an early senior review of patients to establish their acuity of illness and initiate time-critical medical intervention as required. In addition, patients are immediately cohorted to zones within the hospital based on their infection risk, thereby reducing patient footfall throughout the hospital. Its aim is to reduce the spread of infection, by efficiently triaging and streaming patients who present to the hospital prior to them entering clinical areas, while maintaining patient safety and flow through the ED and initiating rapid management of acutely unwell patients.","output":"The incident triage area: a response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bristol Royal Infirmary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In the context of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic in Canada, we aimed to (1) characterize trends in cannabis use in the overall population; and (2) characterize patterns of and identify risk characteristics associated with an increase in cannabis use among those who used cannabis. METHODS: Data were obtained from three waves of an online, repeated cross-sectional survey of adults residing in Canada (May 08-June 23, 2020; Na=a3012). Trends were assessed using Cochran-Armitage and chi-square tests, and risk characteristics were identified using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Cannabis use in the overall population remained stable during the months of May and June. Among those who used cannabis, about half increased their cannabis use compared to before the start of the pandemic. This proportion of an increase in cannabis use among those who used cannabis remained consistent across the survey waves. Risk characteristics associated with higher odds of an increase in cannabis use included residence in the central region (Odds ratio, 95% confidence intervals: 1.93, 1.03-3.62), being 18 to 29 years old (2.61, 1.32-5.17) or 30 to 49 years old (1.85, 1.07-3.19), having less than college or university education (1.86, 1.13-3.06) and being somewhat worried about the pandemic's impact on personal finances (1.73, 1.00-3.00).

Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation).

We aimed to determine the risk and predictors of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 in patients with DM and CVD. Methods: : This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized patients aged  18 years with confirmed COVID-19 in Alborz province, Iran, from 20 February 2020 to 25 March 2020. Data on demographic, clinical and outcome (in-hospital mortality) data were obtained from electronic medical records. Self-reported comorbidities were classified into the following groups: DM (having DM with or without other comorbidities), only DM (having DM without other comorbidities), CVD (having CVD with or without other comorbidities), only CVD (having CVD without other comorbidities), and having any comorbidity. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to quantify the risk and predictors of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 in patients with these comorbidities. Results: : Among 2957 patients with COVID-19, 2656 were discharged as cured, and 301 died. In multivariate model, DM (OR: 1.62 (95%CI: 1.14-2.30)) and only DM (1.69 (1.05-2.74)) increased the risk of death from COVID-19;but, both CVD and only CVD showed non-significant associations (p>0.05). Moreover, having any comorbidities increased the risk of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 (OR: 2.66 (95%CI: 2.09 -3.40)). Significant predictors of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with DM were lymphocyte count, creatinine and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (all P- values < 0.05). Conclusions: : Our findings suggest that diabetic patients have an increased risk of in-hospital mortality following COVID-19;also, lymphocyte count, creatinine and CRP concentrations could be considered as significant predictors for the death of COVID-19 in these patients.","output":"Risk and predictors of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evaluation of perceived safeness and risk by persons is particularly valuable for safety and security handling.

We demonstrate that GA disrupts latent KSHV infection by downregulating the expression of latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and upregulating the expression of viral cyclin and selectively induces cell death of KSHV-infected cells. We show that reduced levels of LANA lead to p53 reactivation, an increase in ROS, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which result in G1 cell cycle arrest, DNA fragmentation, and oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Latent genes are involved in KSHV-induced oncogenesis, and strategies to interfere with their expression might prove useful for eradicating latent KSHV infection and have future therapeutic implications.","output":"Glycyrrhizic acid alters Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus latency, triggering p53-mediated apoptosis in transformed B lymphocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recently, cases of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have increased significantly since the implementation of the new normal policy in Indonesia.

The fundamental role of DUBs is specific removal of ubiquitin from substrates. DUBs contribute to activation/deactivation, recycling and localization of numerous regulatory proteins, and thus play major roles in diverse cellular processes. Altered DUB activity is associated with a multitudes of pathologies including cancer. Therefore, DUBs represent novel candidates for target-directed drug development. AREAS COVERED The article is a thorough review/accounting of patented compounds targeting DUBs and stratifying/classifying the patented compounds based on: chemical-structures, nucleic-acid compositions, modes-of-action, and targeting sites. The review provides a brief background on the UPS and the involvement of DUBs. Furthermore, methods for assessing efficacy and potential pharmacological utility of DUB inhibitor (DUBi) are discussed. EXPERT OPINION The FDA's approval of the 20S proteasome inhibitors (PIs): bortezomib and carfilzomib for treatment of hematological malignancies established the UPS as an anti-cancer target. Unfortunately, many patients are inherently resistant or develop resistance to PIs. One potential strategy to combat PI resistance is targeting upstream components of the UPS such as DUBs. DUBs represent a promising potential therapeutic target due to their critical roles in various cellular processes including protein turnover, localization and cellular homeostasis. While considerable efforts have been undertaken to develop DUB modulators, significant advancements are necessary to move DUBis into the clinic.","output":"Deubiquitinases (DUBs) and DUB inhibitors: a patent review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) with transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in post-operative pain management after laparoscopic colon surgery. METHODS: One hundred thirty-six patients undergoing laparoscopic colon resection randomly received either TEA or TAP with ropivacaine only. The primary endpoint was opioid requirement up to 48 h postoperatively. Intensity of pain, time to onset of bowel function, time to mobilization, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and patients satisfaction with pain management were also assessed. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in opioid consumption on the day of surgery with TEA compared with TAP block (30 mg vs 14 mg, p < 0.001). On the first two postoperative days (POD), the balance shifted to opioid consumption being smaller in the TAP group: on POD 1 (15.2 mg vs 10.6 mg; p = 0.086) and on POD 2 (9.2 mg vs 4.6 mg; p = 0.021).

All the patients were treated with IVIG: 76 patients with IVIG only, and 91 patients with IVIG+GCS. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding age, gender, BMI, or inflammatory markers. Methylprednisolone was the most common drug (80%). Echocardiographic abnormalities on admission were more prevalent in the IVIG+GCS group. Mean time from IVIG infusion to subsidence of fever was 1.1 days, and 1.5 for those in the IVIG+GCS group. Conclusions: GCS are commonly used in the treatment of MIS-C patients in Poland. Various GCS regimens are used, from a single dose to a month-long therapy.

The risk of allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccines may be a reasonable cause for the antivaccination attitude of people with a history of allergies or who consider themselves at risk for having severe allergic reactions after vaccination. Objective Our paper aims to analyze the role of allergist advice in getting people with a history of allergies to trust and accept COVID-19 vaccines and to evaluate the real risk of allergic reactions to these vaccines in this population. Method We performed a retrospective study of patients who asked for allergist advice from our hospital before getting one of the COVID-19 vaccines and who received a consultation either through phone call or online or have been admitted for hospital evaluation in 2021. Results More than 300 calls and 100 online consultations for COVID-19 vaccination-related allergist advice were done in our center within one year. From the total number of 210 people who were evaluated based on a one-day hospital stay in the Allergology department, 64 patients (30.47%) have been scheduled for evaluation before vaccination because of their past or recent medical history of allergies. Nine patients had documented post-vaccination adverse events, which occurred after the first dose in seven cases, after the second dose in one case, and after the booster in one case. The reactions were mild but one was moderate. No patient was considered to have a contraindication or special precaution for COVID-19 vaccination, and all patients with reactions after the first dose could safely complete the vaccination scheme. Conclusion In conclusion, allergist advice and evaluation can significantly influence the decision to vaccinate in patients with a history of allergies.","output":"Role of Allergist Advice in Determining Personal Decisions for COVID-19 Vaccination of People With a History of Allergies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction is a major contributor to the poor outcomes of septic shock. As an add-on with conventional sepsis management for over 15 years, the effect of Xuebijing injection (XBJ) on the sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction was not well understood. The material basis of Xuebijing injection (XBJ) in managing infections and infection-related complications remains to be defined. A murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model and cardiomyocytes in vitro culture were adopted to study the influence of XBJ on infection-induced cardiac dysfunction. XBJ significantly improved the survival of septic-mice and rescued cardiac dysfunction in vivo. RNA-seq revealed XBJ attenuated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and related signalings in the heart which was further confirmed on the mRNA and protein levels. Xuebijing also protected cardiomyocytes from LPS-induced mitochondrial calcium ion overload and reduced the LPS-induced ROS production in cardiomyocytes. The therapeutic effect of XBJ was mediated by the combination of paeoniflorin and hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) (C0127-2). C0127-2 improved the survival of septic mice, protected their cardiac function and cardiomyocytes while balancing gene expression in cytokine-storm-related signalings, such as TNF- and NF-B.

We model the dynamics of directly-transmitted infections (such as SARS-CoV2) propagating on these commuting networks, and find that differences in network structure between the two cities drive divergent predicted epidemic trajectories: the commuting network in Bangkok is composed of geographically contiguous modular communities and epidemic dispersal is correlated with geographic distance between locations, whereas the network in Dhaka has less distinct geographic structure and epidemic dispersal is less constrained by geographic distance.

Comparative studies have not yet been conducted to investigate the impact of these containment measures; these studies are needed to facilitate public health policy-making across countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the impact of national containment measures and policies (stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns) on decelerating the increase in daily new cases of COVID-19 in 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the pandemic in different jurisdictions worldwide. METHODS: We reviewed the effective dates of the national containment measures (stay-at-home order, curfew, or lockdown) of 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wuhan, New York State, Lombardy, and Madrid), and we searched cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and daily new cases provided by health authorities. Data were drawn from an open, crowdsourced, daily-updated COVID-19 data set provided by Our World in Data. We examined the trends in the percent increase in daily new cases from 7 days before to 30 days after the dates on which containment measures went into effect by continent, World Bank income classification, type of containment measures, effective date of containment measures, and number of confirmed cases on the effective date of the containment measures. RESULTS: We included 122,366 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 54 countries and 24,071 patients from 4 epicenters on the effective dates on which stay-at-home orders, curfews, or lockdowns were implemented between January 23 and April 11, 2020. Stay-at-home, curfew, and lockdown measures commonly commenced in countries with approximately 30%, 20%, or 10% increases in daily new cases. All three measures were found to lower the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within one month. Among the countries studied, 20% had an average percent increase in daily new cases of 30-49 over the seven days prior to the commencement of containment measures; the percent increase in daily new cases in these countries was curbed to 10 and 5 a maximum of 15 days and 23 days after the implementation of containment measures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Different national containment measures were associated with a decrease in daily new cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Due to the restrictions posed by COVID-19, there has been a shift from in-person to online forms of assessment. This presents a challenge as not all motor symptoms can be assessed virtually. Two of the four cardinal symptoms of PD (rigidity and postural instability) cannot be assessed virtually using the gold-standard Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). As a result, an accurate total disease severity score cannot be computed from the remaining subsections. Recently, one study stated that in order for accurate scores to be calculated, only three sections could be absent. Virtually, six sections are unable to be evaluated with online assessments. This inability to compute a total disease severity score may result in poor disease management. Thus, in this study a regression equation was developed to predict total disease severity scores from partial scores.Methods: Total disease severity scores from N=234 individuals with idiopathic Parkinsons were retrospectively analyzed. In order to conduct a linear regression analysis predictor and outcome variables were created. The variables were then used for the linear regression. The derived equation was tested on an independent sample of N=1168 participants to predict overall UPDRS-III scores.Findings: The regression analysis resulted in the Almeida-Sang equation to predict total disease severity in PD. Pearson correlation between the predicted full UPDRS-III scores and the actual UPDRS-III scores of the independent data set indicated a strong correlation (R2=0994, p<0001).Interpretation: In conclusion, the Almeida-Sang equation may be essential for the continued management of PD with the limitations brought on by COVID-19, making in-person assessments more challenging.Funding: This study was unfunded.Declaration of Interests: Authors have no conflict of interest to report.Ethics Approval Statement: Ethics approval for secondary data usage was obtained by the Research Ethics Board at Wilfrid Laurier University.","output":"Responding to COVID-19: The 'Almeida-Sang Equation' to Predict Total Disease Severity in Parkinson's"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Several epidemiological studies using sensitive detection methodologies have confirmed that the majority of acute asthma exacerbations follow upper respiratory tract infections C common colds. Most of these colds are due to human rhinoviruses (RVs). RVs are able to reach and replicate in epithelial cells of the lower airways and can activate these cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators. Under some circumstances, RVs can also become cytotoxic to the epithelium. Atopic asthmatic individuals produce less interferon- and more interleukin-10 than normal subjects in response to RV infection. Symptom severity as well as viral shedding after experimental RV infection, is inversely correlated with atopic status, expressed as the interferon- to interleukin-5 ratio. Expression of co-stimulatory molecules on immune cells is also affected in atopic asthmatics, suggesting an aberrant immune response to RV that may lead to suboptimal viral clearance and viral persistence. Some of the above effects can be reversed in vitro by corticosteroids, second-generation antihistamines or anti-oxidants; however, the optimal strategy for treating acute asthma exacerbations requires further research at both mechanistic and clinical levels.","output":"Mechanisms of rhinovirus-induced asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supply chain integration plays an important role in the development of the vegetable industry in terms of vegetable quality, vegetable safety, and vegetable security in rural China.

PATIENT CONCERNS A Slovenian woman diagnosed with relapsed bone metastases of breast cancer (BC) was unable to undergo surgery and refused radiation therapy due to fear of side effects; she also feared the side effects of adjuvants. However, she was eager to live with a high quality of life. DIAGNOSIS Stage IV, HR-positive/HER2-negative BC with relapse of bone metastases. INTERVENTIONS After diagnosis of relapse of bone metastases, she received adjuvant with PAL plus FUL. Additionally, she chose to take AC orally (10 g/d). OUTCOMES The pain was mostly relieved, and the side effects of adjuvant therapy reduced. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed reduction of tumor size at the fifth month of adjuvant therapy plus AC. After 14 months of adjuvant therapy plus AC, the tumors at the thoracic vertebrae T1 and T3 were found to have shrunk from 35.2 and 12.0 mm to 28.1 and 9.9 mm, respectively. Remarkably, no further metastases were observed. LESSONS According to the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) test data, AC had better anti-tumor efficacy on active tumor cells than PAL plus FUL. Thus, AC could be an effective complementary medicine for adjuvant therapy in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC. Interestingly, continued elevation of carcinoma antigen 15-3 and lactate dehydrogenase levels but decreasing levels of alkaline phosphatase were observed, which may be indicative of the potent efficacy of treatment resulting in massive tumor cell death. The CTCs test may be a sensitive approach to monitor the progression of BC and subsequently evaluate the efficiency of therapy.","output":"Antrodia cinnamomea is a potentially effective complementary medicine for adjuvant therapy against breast cancer with bone metastasis: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Skeleton Key Group (SKG) is an online collective of trainees working to generate free, open-access medical education (FOAMed) focusing on electrolyte disorders.

Results: After an accelerated onset, the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to be relatively controlled in Chile (late April 2020), with reproductive numbers close to 1.00. However, at this time, the load of infected patients was high, with an important number of underreported cases; the diagnostic effort was still limited and heterogeneous across regions.

One of these strategies is placing a higher emphasis on individuals, who are expected to better manage their own health and illness. mHealth applications could increase this self-management behaviour among older adults. However, it is crucial to know the intention to use mHealth of older adults before implementing these services. Even less is known regarding differences between genders on factors influencing this intention to use mHealth applications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study the gender differences regarding the relationship between technology acceptance factors and the intention to use mHealth applications in the Dutch elderly population. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative cross-sectional study using questionnaires. The participants were 65 years or older, lived independently or in a senior living facility, without cognitive impairment. Logistic regression with interaction terms was done to determine gender differences in the relationship between the intention to use mHealth applications and technology acceptance factors. RESULTS: While we found that half of the studied population had intention to use medical applications (50.3%) a notable difference was observed within gender groups which showed more men had intention to use medical applications rather than women (59.4% vs. 43.4% respectively). Adjusted logistic regression analysis per factor on the male and female part of the study population respectively showed that the factors Perceived usefulness (OR 21,69 and 2,39, resp.), Perceived ease of use (OR 7,21 and 2,74), Attitude toward use (OR 24,61 and 4,94), Sense of control (OR 4,12 and 2,67), Personal innovativeness (OR 2,54 and 1,58), Self-perceived effectiveness (OR 3,21 and 2,34), Service availability (OR 4,38 and 2,51) and Facilitating circumstances (OR 3,04 and 2,18) had a statistically significant influence on intention to use in both models. Logistic regression with interaction terms showed that two of the technology acceptance factors differed statistically significant in their relationship with intention to use when comparing females to males, namely Perceived usefulness (OR 0,11) and Attitude toward use (OR 0.24). Both factors were more strongly associated with intention to use for men compared to women. CONCLUSION: Policymakers and interventions aiming to stimulate the uptake of mHealth applications should acknowledge gender differences. Interventions based on improving the Perceived usefulness and Attitude toward use among female users could be a means to stimulate the full potential of medical applications and improve the uptake.

Despite high vaccination coverage this disease remains a public health concern worldwide. A better understanding of the protective immune responses to B. pertussis is required for the development of improved vaccines. The aim of this study was to determine the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by human neutrophils in response to B. pertussis and to determine the contribution of opsonizing antibodies from convalescent pertussis patients in this response. The serum samples from convalescent patients were taken at <3, 9, 18 and 36 months after diagnosis of pertussis. Also included were sera from healthy age-matched controls. We show that neutrophils produced high levels of ROS in response to opsonized, compared to non-opsonized, B. pertussis and that this effect was independent of the time the convalescent serum samples were taken. This indicates the presence of functional opsonizing antibodies up to 3 years after B. pertussis infection. While opsonization of B. pertussis with serum samples from uninfected controls also induced ROS production, sera from infected individuals induced significantly higher ROS levels. Spearman correlations analysis showed that IgG antibodies targeting fimbriae3 followed by pertactin, and BrkA correlate with ROS production. Additionally, we observed that neutrophils killed opsonized B. pertussis in a ROS-dependent manner. Searching for other antigen-specific antibodies from convalescent pertussis patients involved in ROS production by neutrophils may assist in the identification of novel antigens to improve the current pertussis vaccines.","output":"Long Lasting Antibodies From Convalescent Pertussis Patients Induce ROS Production and Bacterial Killing by Human Neutrophils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of social distancing policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of oral and maxillofacial fractures at an urban, Level I trauma center in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigators designed a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample of 883 subjects who presented for evaluation of oral and maxillofacial fractures (OMF) between March 1 and June 30 in the years 2018 through 2020. The primary predictor variable was the evaluation of OMF during a period with social distancing policies (2020 - experimental group) or without social distancing policies in place (2018 or 2019 - control group). The primary outcome variables were the facial fracture diagnosis, the abbreviated injury scale (AIS), injury severity score (ISS), and the mechanism of injury. Appropriate univariate and bivariate statistics were computed, and the level of significance was set at P < .05 for all tests. RESULTS: The number of subjects presenting with OMF was lower during the period of social distancing (n = 235 in 2020) than during the periods without (2018: n = 330; 2019: n = 318). During the period of social distancing, there were more individuals who presented secondary to assault, whereas fewer individuals presented secondary to falls (P = .05). On average, those who presented in 2020 had more severe oral and maxillofacial injuries (mean AIS = 3.2  1.2 in 2020 vs 3.0  1.1 in 2019 and 3.0  1.1 in 2018.

METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen COVID-19-positive patients were enrolled, including 87 severe cases and 128 mild-moderate cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and IgM/IgG antibodies, as well as TTV DNA loads, were measured on longitudinal plasma samples. RESULTS: The rate of severe cases was higher in patients with low TTV DNA load in plasma considering a threshold of 700 copies/mL. In severe patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positivity rates were higher than those in mild-moderate cases at any timepoint. When combined, TTV DNA load and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia allowed to predict the outcome of COVID-19 infection, with a higher risk (HR=12.4) of ICU admission in patients with low TTV DNA load and positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia.

This study described how, in the context of the early stages of the pandemic, clinicians used telemedicine for OUD in conjunction with in-person care, barriers encountered, and implications for quality of care. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted semistructured interviews with clinicians waivered to prescribe buprenorphine. We used maximum variation sampling. We used standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: Eighteen clinicians representing 10 states participated. Nearly all interview participants were doing some telemedicine, and more than half were only doing telemedicine visits. Most participants reported changing their typical clinical care patterns to help patients remain at home and minimize exposure to COVID-19. Changes included waiving urine toxicology screening, sending patients home with a larger supply of OUD medications, and requiring fewer visits. Although several participants were serving new patients via telemedicine during the early weeks of the pandemic, others were not. Some clinicians identified positive impacts of telemedicine on the quality of their patient interactions, including increased access for patients. Others noted negative impacts including less structure and accountability, less information to inform clinical decision-making, challenges in establishing a connection, technological challenges, and shorter visits. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the pandemic, buprenorphine prescribers quickly transitioned to providing telemedicine visits in high volume; nonetheless, there are still many unknowns, including the quality and safety of widespread use of telemedicine for OUD treatment.","output":"Treatment of opioid use disorder during COVID-19: Experiences of clinicians transitioning to telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper develops a methodology for the early detection of reactivation of tourist markets to help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, using Skyscanner data on air passenger searches (&gt;5,000 million) and picks (&gt;600 million), for flights between November 2018 and December 2020, through ForwardKeys. For future travel during the May to September 2020 period, the desire to travel (based on the number of flight searches) has dropped by about 30% in Europe and the Americas, and by about 50% in Asia, while intention to travel (the number of flight picks, the final selections amongst flight searches) has dropped a further 10C20%.

Although adherence towards preventive measures is the only means to tackle the virus, reluctance to do so has been reported to be a major problem everywhere. Thus, this study aimed to assess the community's adherence towards COVID-19 mitigation strategies and its associated factors among Gondar City residents, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was employed among 635 respondents from April 20-27, 2020. Cluster sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Epi-Data version 4.6 and STATA version 14 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Binary logistic regressions (Bivariable and multivariable) were performed to identify statistically significant variables. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables on the basis of p < 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of good adherence towards COVID-19 mitigation measures was 51.04% (95%CI: 47.11, 54.96). Female respondents [AOR: 2.39; 95%CI (1.66, 3.45)], receiving adequate information about COVID-19 [AOR: 1.58; 95%CI (1.03, 2.43)], and favorable attitude towards COVID-19 preventive measures were significantly associated with good adherence towards COVID-19 mitigation measures.

Public understanding of viruses reinforces their malignaspects, especially nowadays under the COVID-19 global pandemic. It is our aim here to propose a new way to view viruses and understand their origins and evolution. First, viruses are the most abundant biological systems found on Earth. They can be found almost everywhere and form a subtle biological layer named virosphere. Second, viruses are probably the most important drivers of molecular evolution and they are active agents of ecosystems maintenance and homeostasis, allowing and driving their dynamic modification. A significant number of eukaryotic genomes are composed by genome elements similar to viruses and these endogenous viruses are continuously acting for our equilibrium and fitness. They are responsible for the origin of species-specific orphan genes that allow adaptation through the development of specific traits in separate lineages of eukaryotes. Accumulated evidence indicate that a viral infection was responsible to create the eukaryotic nucleus and, also, it is a syncytium structure caused by viral replication that allows the formation of the placenta. Therefore, viruses were fundamental for the evolutionary fate of eukaryotes and mammals. The presence of virus-specific genes that are absent in cellular organisms indicates that viruses existed before cells. Besides, such as progenotes, viruses are simply ribonucleoproteic entities and their capsids are orders of magnitude simpler than proteolipidic membranes. Here, we (i) propose a complete scenario to describe the major transitions in prebiotic evolution, (ii) present the possibility that viruses emerged before LUCA, and (iii) suggest that viruses originated at the age of progenotes. However, viruses do not form a monophyletic clade. They should be seen as an evolutionary stable strategy recurrently achieved by biological systems to survive. We propose that the word VIRUS, known as venom, is historically mistaken and introduce a new interpretation for their name as an acronym for Very Important Replicator Unit and Symbiont. But more than being very important, viruses are of Utmostrelevance for the maintenance of life in biosphere, by which reason we suggest referring to them as UIRUSto reinforce their incredible role in symbiosis and their beneficial characteristics over the infectious ones.","output":"The Misleading History of VIRUSes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Knowledge on the epidemiology, genotypic and phenotypic features of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) ESKAPEE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli) and their association with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are limited in Malaysia. Therefore, we evaluated the AMR features and resistance mechanisms of the ESKAPEE pathogens collected in a tertiary hospital located in the capital of Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 378 AMR-ESKAPEE strains were obtained based on convenience sampling over a nine-month study period (2019C2020). All strains were subjected to disk diffusion and broth microdilution assays to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequence analyses were performed to determine the AMR genes profiles of the non-susceptible strains.

We detected two novel mutations in the quinolone-resistant determining region of the gyrA in fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (Leu-102-Ala; Gly-105-Val). Microbial resistance to ampicillin, methicillin, and cephalosporins was identified as important risk factors associated with HAIs in the hospital. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings may provide valuable insight into the microbial resistance pattern and the risk factors of ESKAPEE-associated HAIs in a tertiary hospital located in central Peninsular Malaysia.

Remyelination declines in progressive MS, causing permanent axonal loss and irreversible disabilities. Strategies aimed at enhancing remyelination are critical to attenuate disease progression. OBJECTIVE We systematically reviewed recent advances in neuroprotective and regenerative therapies for MS, covering preclinical and clinical studies. METHODS We searched three biomedical databases using defined keywords. Two authors independently reviewed articles for inclusion based on pre-specified criteria. The data were extracted from each study and assessed for risk of bias. RESULTS Our search identified 7351 studies from 2014 to 2020, of which 221 met the defined criteria. These studies reported 262 interventions, wherein 92% were evaluated in animal models. These interventions comprised protein, RNA, lipid and cellular biologics, small molecules, inorganic compounds, and dietary and physiological interventions. Small molecules were the most highly represented strategy, followed by antibody therapies and stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION While significant strides have been made to develop regenerative treatments for MS, the current evidence illustrates a skewed representation of the types of strategies that advance to clinical trials. Further examination is thus required to address current barriers to implementing experimental treatments in clinical settings.","output":"Current status of neuroprotective and neuroregenerative strategies in multiple sclerosis: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Around the world, proposals for new taxes on the stock of wealth (a wealth tax) were gaining traction even before the fiscal tumult that has followed the COVID-19 pandemic. Piketty's utopian ideal of a global wealth tax is perhaps the most prominent example.1 In the US, a new wealth tax proposed by Saez and Zucman (2019) was taken up by prominent candidates for the 2019 Democratic primaries. The OECD recently conducted a wide-ranging review of the wealth taxes already in operation within its member countries,2 and new empirical research has also examined the impacts of existing wealth taxes in a developing country context. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated this interest in wealth taxes. First off the mark was Argentina, which in December 2020 passed a new one-off levy on its wealthiest citizens (with assets over $2.5 million) to pay for medical supplies and relief measures.4 In April 2021, in response to concerns about a $5 trillion surge in the wealth of the world's richest individuals during the pandemic, the UN Secretary-General urged governments to consider introducing a new solidarity or wealth tax.5 The International Monetary Fund has also recommended that countries consider taxes on high wealth, emphasising the symbolic impact of this type of contribution in the context of recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"Taxes on wealth: time for another look?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Ever since the first case was reported at the end of 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus and associated lung disease COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has become a pandemic. In particular, the high transmission rate of the virus has made it a threat to public health globally. Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome. Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances and use of antiviral drugs.

DESIGN: Prospective, between March 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020. SETTING: Intensive care unit of Amiens University Hospital (France). PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with moderate-to-severe CARDS under mechanical ventilation for fewer than 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Tricuspid annular displacement (TAD) parameters (TAD-septal, TAD-lateral, and RV longitudinal shortening fraction [RV-LSF]), RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS), and RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) were measured using transesophageal echocardiography with a dedicated software and compared with classic RV systolic parameters (RV-FAC, S' wave, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE]). RV systolic dysfunction was defined as RV-FAC <35%. Twenty-nine consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe CARDS were included. ACP was diagnosed in 12 patients (41%). 2D-STE parameters were markedly altered in the ACP group, and no significant difference was found between patients with and without ACP for classic RV parameters (RV-FAC, S' wave, and TAPSE). In the ACP group, RV-LSF (17% [14%-22%]) had the best correlation with RV-FAC (ra?=a?0.79, p < 0.001 v ra?=a?0.27, pa?=a?0.39 for RVGLS and ra?=a?0.28, pa?=a?0.39 for RVFWLS). A RV-LSF cut-off value of 17% had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 86% to identify RV systolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Classic RV function parameters were not altered by ACP in patients with CARDS, contrary to 2D-STE parameters.

Bringing lignin research to AM has prompted the emergence of the nascent \\"lignin 3D printing\\" field. This review presents the recent state of art of this promising field and highlights its challenges and opportunities. Following a review of the industrial availability, molecular attributes, and associated properties of technical lignins, we review R&D efforts at implementing lignin systems in extrusion-based and stereolithography (SLA) printing technologies. Doing so underlines the adage of lignin research that \\"all lignins are not created equal,\\" and stresses the opportunity nested in this chemical diversity created mostly by differences in isolation conditions to molecularly select and tune the attributes of technical lignin systems towards desirable properties, be it by modification or polymer blending.

To assess the performance of an extended questionnaire in identifying cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among obstetric patients. 2. To evaluate the rate of infection among healthcare workers involved in womens care. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of obstetric patients admitted to MBBM Foundation and Buzzi Hospital (Lombardy, Northern Italy) from March 16(th) to May 22(nd), 2020. Women were screened on admission by a questionnaire investigating major and minor symptoms of infection and high-risk contacts in the last 14 days. SARS-CoV-2 assessment was performed by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. Till April 7(th), a targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing triggered by a positive questionnaire was used; from April 8(th), a universal testing approach was implemented. RESULTS: There were 1,177 women screened by the questionnaire, which yielded a positive result in 130 (11.0%) cases. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed in 865 (73.5%) patients, identifying 51 (5.9%) infections. During the first period, there were 29 infected mothers, 4 (13.8%) of whom had a negative questionnaire. After universal testing implementation, there were 22 (3%, 95% CI 1.94% - 4.04%) infected mothers, 13 (59.1%) of whom had a negative questionnaire; rate of infection among asymptomatic women was 1.9%. Six of the 17 SARS-CoV-2-positive women with a negative questionnaire reported symptoms more than 14 but within 30 days before admission.

CONCLUSIONS: An exhaustive triage questionnaire can effectively discriminate women at low risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of a targeted and a universal viral testing approach. In 15.7% of infected women, correct classification as a suspected case of infection was due to investigation of olfactory and taste disorders.

The masks of these two parts of images then were converted to corresponding volumes to calculate the physical proportion of infected region of lung. A total of 129 CT image set were herein collected and studied. The intrinsic Hounsfiled value of CT images was firstly utilized to generate the initial dirty version of labeled masks both for intact lung and infected regions. Then, the samples were carefully adjusted and improved by two professional radiologists to generate the final training set and test benchmark. Two deep learning models were evaluated: UNet and 2.5D UNet. For the segment of infected regions, a deep learning based classifier was followed to remove unrelated blur-edged regions that were wrongly segmented out such as air tube and blood vessel tissue etc. For the segmented masks of intact lung and infected regions, the best method could achieve 0.972 and 0.757 measure in mean Dice similarity coefficient on our test benchmark. As the overall proportion of infected region of lung, the final result showed 0.961 (Pearson's correlation coefficient) and 11.7% (mean absolute percent error).

The HIT Collaborative developed an Advanced Liver Disease (ALD) Dashboard to identify Veterans with cirrhosis who were due for surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other liver care, promoted the use of an HCC Clinical Reminder in the electronic health record, and provided training and networking opportunities. This evaluation aimed to describe the VHA's approach to improving cirrhosis care and identify the facility factors and HIT activities associated with HCC surveillance rates, using a quasi-experimental design. Across all VHA facilities, as the HIT focused on cirrhosis between 2018-2019, HCC surveillance rates increased from 46% (IQR 37-53%) to 51% (IQR 42-60%, p < 0.001). The median HCC surveillance rate was 57% in facilities with high ALD Dashboard utilization compared with 45% in facilities with lower utilization (p < 0.001) and 58% in facilities using the HCC Clinical Reminder compared with 47% in facilities not using this tool (p < 0.001) in FY19.

This unprecedented situation allows for development and application of new research approaches. One of the major technical hurdles in immunology is the characterization of HLA-antigen-T cell receptor (TCR) specificities. Most approaches aim to identify reactive T cells starting from known antigens using functional assays. However, the need for a reverse approach identifying the antigen specificity of orphan TCRs is increasing. Utilizing large public single-cell gene expression and TCR datasets, we identified highly public CD4+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, covering >75% of the analysed population. We performed an integrative meta-analysis to deeply characterize these clonotypes by TCR sequence, gene expression, HLA-restriction, and antigen-specificity, identifying strong and public CD4+ immunodominant responses with confirmed specificity. CD4+ COVID-enriched clonotypes show T follicular helper functional features, while clonotypes depleted in SARS-CoV-2 individuals preferentially had a central memory phenotype. In total we identify more than 1200 highly public CD4+ T cell clonotypes reactive to SARS-CoV-2. TCR similarity analysis showed six prominent TCR clusters, for which we predicted both HLA-restriction and cognate SARS-CoV-2 immunodominant epitopes. To validate our predictions we used an independent cohort of TCR repertoires before and after vaccination with ChAdOx1, a replication-deficient simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We find statistically significant enrichment of the predicted spike-reactive TCRs after vaccination with ChAdOx1, while the frequency of TCRs specific to other SARS-CoV-2 proteins remains stable. Thus, the CD4-associated TCR repertoire differentiates vaccination from natural infection. In conclusion, our study presents a novel reverse epitope discovery approach that can be used to infer HLA- and antigen-specificity of orphan TCRs in any context, such as viral infections, antitumor immune responses, or autoimmune disease.

Thus, it is essential that hospital pharmacists receive specific training in technical aspects concerning the possession and use of medical devices. This will help guarantee an effective and safe use of medical products. The acquisition and use of medical devices requires a keen understanding of the technical and legal aspects concerning these products, which makes hospital pharmacists essential for the integral management of medical devices.","output":"El servicio de farmacia: Gestin integral de productos sanitarios en SARS-CoV-2./ Hospital Pharmacy: Comprehensive management of medical devices during SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic decreed by the World Health Organization (WHO) since March 12, 2020 is wreaking havoc globally and it is a true economic, social and health challenge. Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory symptoms, some patients also have cardiological symptoms. Among patients with cardiological conditions2 they represent a group of higher risk and, in fact, they are a particularly vulnerable group, due to their higher risk of contagion and greater severity in case of acquiring the disease1 those with heart failure (HF), including heart transplant (CT) and ventricular assists, as well as patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). HF is the main chronic cardiovascular disease and patients in this group are the most vulnerable for the development of more serious clinical symptoms after suffering the infection, and to a greater extent cases with advanced HF3. In fact, HF is one of the most frequent complications in patients with COVID-194. Likewise, transplant patients who require immunosuppressants to avoid graft rejection, constitute a population especially susceptible to infection and to develop more serious processes. This situation has made the National Association of Cardiologists of Mexico (ANCAM) and the Mexican Society of Cardiology (SMC) together with their respective chapters, have prepared the following recommendations for medical personnel, who participate in the care of this special group of patients in the different clinical settings, who suffer or not, of COVID-19.","output":"Recomendaciones para la atencin de pacientes con insuficiencia cardiaca y COVID-19./ Recommendations for the care of patients with heart failure and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There are limited data on the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on hospitalized patients with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disease (AICID) compared with patients who do not have AICID. We sought to evaluate whether patients with AICID who have confirmed COVID-19 presenting to the hospital are at higher risk of adverse outcomes compared with those patients without AICID who are infected with COVID-19 and whether immunosuppressive medications impact this risk. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study with patients presenting to five hospitals in a large academic health system with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection. We evaluated the impact of having an AICID and class of immunosuppressive medication being used to treat patients with AICID (biologics, nonbiologic immunosuppressives, or systemic corticosteroids) on the risk of developing severe COVID-19 defined as requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or death. RESULTS: A total of 6792 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study, with 159 (2.3%) having at least one AICID. On multivariable analysis, AICIDs were not significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-1.8). Among patients with AICID, use of biologics or nonbiologic immunosuppressives did not increase the risk of severe COVID-19. In contrast, systemic corticosteroid use was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (aOR 6.8, 95% CI: 2.5-18.4). CONCLUSION: Patients with AICID are not at increased risk of severe COVID-19 with the exception of those on corticosteroids. These data suggest that patients with AICID should continue on biologic and nonbiologic immunosuppression but limit steroids during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Autoimmune and Chronic Inflammatory Disease Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Web Exclusive.

METHOD: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28.

The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which have already been reduced to small and endangered populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme\\\\2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies have shown that rhesus macaques exposed to the virus develop COVID-19-like symptoms, the susceptibility of other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, as well as some lemurs are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARSCoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival.

Given the fact that some of these therapeutics are multi-acting molecules, other relevant mechanisms will also be described. The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules and macromolecules of sulfated polysaccharides, polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. The potential therapeutics target viral and/or host proteins or processes that facilitate the early stage of the viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral spike protein, the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the host transmembrane protease serine 2, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis process. Overall, the review aims at presenting update-to-date details, so as to enhance awareness of potential therapeutics, and thus, to catalyze their appropriate use in combating the pandemic.","output":"Potential Anti-COVID-19 Therapeutics that Block the Early Stage of the Viral Life Cycle: Structures, Mechanisms, and Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has highlighted the importance of hospital infection-control programs.

In the mouse tissues after exposure to X-ray, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased and melatonin was able to reduce it. The MDA concentration was higher in the cerebral cortex tissue than that in the spleen tissue of the mouse. In mouse tissues following irradiation, the glutathione (GSH) level was low. The spleen GSH content was more than twice as low as that in the cerebral cortex. Melatonin helped restore the GSH levels in the mouse tissues.

We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors that predicted whether a VAMC was in the top quartile of VA Video Connect (VVC) telehealth uptake for primary care and mental health care. Results: All 139 VAMCs increased their VVC uptake at least 2-fold early in the pandemic, with most increasing uptake between 5- and 10-fold. Pre-COVID-19, higher VVC uptake in primary care was weakly and positively associated with having more high-risk patients, negatively associated with having more long-distance patients, and positively associated with the prior fiscal year's VVC uptake. During COVID-19, the positive association with high-risk patients and the negative association with long-distance patients strengthened, while weaker broadband coverage was negatively associated with VVC uptake. For mental health care, having more long-distance patients was positively associated with higher VVC uptake pre-COVID-19, but this relationship reversed during COVID-19. Discussion: Despite the marked increase in VVC uptake early in the COVID-19 pandemic, significant VAMC-level variation indicates that VVC adoption was more difficult for some medical centers, particularly those with poorer broadband coverage and less prior VVC experience.

Individual behaviour, mobility, viral variants and transmission vary locally, temporally and with season, and interventions and vaccination are often implemented regionally. Therefore, we developed a new regional changepoint stochastic SEIR metapopulation model. The model is informed by real-time mobility estimates from mobile phone data, laboratory-confirmed cases, and hospitalisation incidence. To estimate locally and time-varying transmissibility, case detection probabilities, and missed imported cases, we present a new sequential Approximate Bayesian Computation method allowing inference in useful time, despite the high parametric dimension.

The model is informed by near real-time mobile phone mobility data, laboratory-confirmed cases, and hospitalisation incidence. The model is used to estimate reproduction numbers and provide regional predictions of future hospital beds. Regional reproduction numbers are important due spatio-temporal heterogeneity due to for example local interventions. We assume different regional reproduction numbers for different periods of the epidemic.

The aim: review scientific research to find out whether the new coronavirus infection (NCI) causes fibrotic changes in the lungs and, if any, how long they persist and whether functional disorders of the respiratory system accompany them. Disruption of the functional state of the lungs in patients with severe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still seen 6 months after completion of inpatient treatment. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) demonstrates persistent pathological changes in the lungs, some of which are fibrosis-like. Pathomorphological features of the COVID-19 course, as well as the ability of the virus to activate connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and enhance the signaling of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-), can contribute to lung tissue fibrosis. Increased titers of antinuclear autoantibodies and specific autoantibodies indirectly reveal dysregulation of the immune response leading to the progression of organizing pneumonia and fibrotic changes in the lung tissue. These increased titers can also indicate the need to prescribe immunosuppressive and antifibrotic drugs. Researchers are considering the possibility of including antifibrotic drugs in combination therapy for severe COVID-19 in the early stages of treatment in patients with risk factors for developing pulmonary fibrosis. However, further monitoring and determination of the role of antifibrotic drugs are required.

The present study investigated the withanolides as an immune booster and anti-viral agents against the coronavirus-19. Withanolides from Withania somnifera were retrieved from the open-source database, their targets were predicted using DIGEP-Pred, and the protein-protein interaction was evaluated. The drug-likeness score and intestinal absorptivity of each compound were also predicted. The network of compounds, proteins, and modulated pathways was constructed using Cytoscape, and docking was performed using autodock4.0, and selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to 100 ns Molecular Dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics trajectories were subjected to free energy calculation by the MM-GBSA method. Withanolide_Q was predicted to modulate the highest number of proteins, showed human intestinal absorption, and was predicted for the highest drug-likeness score. Similarly, combined network interaction identified Withanolide_Q to target the highest number of proteins; RAC1 was majorly targeted, and fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis associated pathway were chiefly regulated. Similarly, Withanolide_D and Withanolide_G were predicted to have a better binding affinity with PLpro, Withanolide_M with 3CLpro, and Withanolide_M with spike protein based on binding energy and number of hydrogen bond interactions. MD studies suggested Withanoside_I with the highest binding free energy (Gbind-31.56 kcal/mol) as the most promising inhibitor. Among multiple withanolides from W. somnifera, Withanolide_D, Withanolide_G, Withanolide_M, and Withanolide_Q were predicted as the lead hits based on drug-likeness score, modulated proteins, and docking score to boost the immune system and inhibit the COVID-19 infection, which could primarily act against COVID-19.

The clinical background and clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among Japanese patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: This study is an observational cohort of Japanese IBD patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Data on age, sex, IBD (classification, treatment, and activity), COVID-19 symptoms and severity, and treatment of COVID-19 were analyzed. RESULTS: From 72 participating facilities in Japan, 187 patients were registered from June 2020 to October 2021. The estimated incidence of COVID19 in Japanese IBD patients was 0.61%. The majority of IBD patients with COVID-19 (73%) were in clinical remission. According to the WHO classification regarding COVID-19 severity, 93% (172/184) of IBD patients had non-severe episodes, while 7% (12/184) were severe cases including serious conditions. 90.9% (165/187) of IBD patients with COVID-19 had no change in IBD disease activity. A logistic regression analysis stepwise method revealed that older age, higher body mass index (BMI), and steroid use were independent risk factors for COVID-19 severity. Six of nine patients who had COVID-19 after vaccination were receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- antibodies.

We consider repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing models for the purpose of containing outbreaks in the residential campus community. The goal of repeat testing is to detect and isolate new infections rapidly to block transmission that would otherwise occur both on and off campus. The models allow for specification of aspects including scheduled on-campus resident screening at a given frequency, test sensitivity that can depend on the time since infection, imported infections from off campus throughout the school term, and a lag from testing until student isolation due to laboratory turnaround and student relocation delay. For early- (late-) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age of infection, we find that weekly screening cannot reliably contain outbreaks with reproductive numbers above 1.4 (1.6) if more than one imported exposure per 10,000 students occurs daily. Screening every three days can contain outbreaks providing the reproductive number remains below 1.75 (2.3) if transmission happens earlier (later) with time from infection, but at the cost of increased false positive rates requiring more isolation quarters for students testing positive. Testing frequently while minimizing the delay from testing until isolation for those found positive are the most controllable levers for preventing large residential college outbreaks.

Internationally, there are lower rates of opioid-related mortality, possibly because of differences in prescribing and health system policies. Our aim was to compare opioid prescribing rates in patients without cancer, across 5 centers in 4 countries. In addition, we evaluated differences in the type, strength, and starting dose of medication and whether these characteristics changed over time. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of adults who are new users of opioids without prior cancer. Electronic health records and administrative health records from Boston (United States), Quebec and Alberta (Canada), United Kingdom, and Taiwan were used to identify patients between 2006 and 2015. Standard dosages in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) were calculated according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Age- and sex-standardized opioid prescribing rates were calculated for each jurisdiction. Of the 2,542,890 patients included, 44,690 were from Boston (US), 1,420,136 Alberta, 26,871 Quebec (Canada), 1,012,939 UK, and 38,254 Taiwan. The highest standardized opioid prescribing rates in 2014 were observed in Alberta at 66/1,000 persons compared to 52, 51, and 18/1,000 in the UK, US, and Quebec, respectively. The median MME/day (IQR) at initiation was highest in Boston at 38 (20 to 45); followed by Quebec, 27 (18 to 43); Alberta, 23 (9 to 38); UK, 12 (7 to 20); and Taiwan, 8 (4 to 11). Oxycodone was the first prescribed opioid in 65% of patients in the US cohort compared to 14% in Quebec, 4% in Alberta, 0.1% in the UK, and none in Taiwan. One of the limitations was that data were not available from all centers for the entirety of the 10-year period. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed substantial differences in opioid prescribing practices for non-cancer pain between jurisdictions. The preference to start patients on higher MME/day and more potent opioids in North America may be a contributing cause to the opioid epidemic.","output":"Opioid prescribing among new users for non-cancer pain in the USA, Canada, UK, and Taiwan: A population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has altered all aspects of performing medical procedures throughout the world It is important to stratify patients into categories according to the likelihood that a requested exam will result in a change in acute management Health care staff should maintain adequate distancing and engage in frequent hand washing, and personnel who are patient-facing should put on PPE at all times All patient-touching apparatus should be disinfected between patients according to the Infection Control protocols of the institutions Most labs have chosen to have patients wear surgical masks to afford some level of protection for them Efforts should be implemented to enable remote reading and remote reporting of study results The guidelines presented in this paper are based on the currently available information regarding SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) viral infections, but it is essential that all laboratories comply with evolving recommendations of their institutions and public health authorities","output":"Approach to Protecting Patients and Staff in Nuclear Cardiology Laboratories in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially fatal disease. clinical practice shows that Chinese Patent Medicine (CPM) has played an important role in the outbreak, Among them, Jinhua Qinggan granules, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, and Xuebiqing injection have an effect in treating COVID-19 patients, but it has not been systematically evaluated for efficacy and safety.

The development of infections, inflammatory factors, neurologic outcome at discharge and risk factors for in-hospital infection were assessed in patients with and without high dose steroid therapy before and after immunotherapy. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and logistic regression models were established to assess risk factors for in-hospital infection. RESULTS: A total of 278 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis were included in the study. Thirty-four patients received high dose methylprednisolone (IVMP) therapy only, 84 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, and 160 patients received IVIG and IVMP therapy. Compared with the IVIG group, IVIG + IVMP group had a higher infection rate (64.38% vs 39.29%, P < 0.001), a higher incidence of noninfectious complications (76.25% vs 61.90%, P = 0.018) and a higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge from the hospital (3 vs 2, P < 0.001). Inflammatory indicators, including white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), were higher (9.93 vs 5.65, 6.94 vs 3.47 and 1.47 vs 0.70, respectively, P < 0.001) in the IVIG + IVMP group than in the IVIG group. Moreover, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) was lower (2.20 vs 2.54, P = 0.047) in the IVIG + IVMP group.

Specifically, we are interested in how differences in the amino acid and codon sequence lead to different incubation periods and outbreak periods. Results: The initial question we had was to compare SARS-CoV-2 to different viruses in the coronavirus family to understand its characteristics. The result of experiments using BLAST, Apriori and Decision Tree has shown that SARS-CoV-2 had high similarity with SARS-CoV while having comparably low similarity with MERS-CoV. We decided to compare the codons of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV to see the difference. Though the viruses are very alike according to BLAST and Apriori experiments, SVM proved that they can be effectively classified using non-linear kernels. Decision Tree experiment has proved several remarkable properties of SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequence that cannot be found in MERS-CoV amino acid sequence.The consequential purpose of this paper is to minimize the damage on humanity from SARS-CoV-2.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a machine learningCbased screening tool using patient-generated health data (PGHD) obtained from a mobile health (mHealth) app. METHODS: We trained a deep learning model based on a gated recurrent unit to screen influenza using PGHD, including each patients fever pattern and drug administration records. We used meteorological data and app-based surveillance of the weekly number of patients with influenza. We defined a single episode as the set of consecutive days, including the day the user was diagnosed with influenza or another disease. Any record a user entered 24 hours after his or her last record was considered to be the start of a new episode. Each episode contained data on the users age, gender, weight, and at least one body temperature record. The total number of episodes was 6657. Of these, there were 3326 episodes within which influenza was diagnosed. We divided these episodes into 80% training sets (2664/3330) and 20% test sets (666/3330). A 5-fold cross-validation was used on the training set. RESULTS: We achieved reliable performance with an accuracy of 82%, a sensitivity of 84%, and a specificity of 80% in the test set. After the effect of each input variable was evaluated, app-based surveillance was observed to be the most influential variable. The correlation between the duration of input data and performance was not statistically significant (P=.09).

The annual contribution of influenza to use of intensive care is difficult to estimate, as many people with influenza present without a classic influenza syndrome and laboratory testing may not be performed. We used a population-based approach to estimate and compare the impact of recent epidemics of seasonal and pandemic influenza. METHODS: For 2007 to 2010, time series describing health outcomes in various population groups were prepared from a database of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Serfling approach, a time series method, was used to estimate seasonal patterns in health outcomes in the absence of influenza epidemics. The contribution of influenza was estimated by subtracting expected seasonal use from observed use during each epidemic period. RESULTS: The estimated excess rate of influenza-associated respiratory ICU admissions per 100,000 inhabitants was more than three times higher in 2007 (2.6/100,000, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.1) than the pandemic year, 2009 (0.76/100,000, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.48). In 2009, the highest excess respiratory ICU admission rate was in 17 to 64 year olds (2.9/100,000, 95% CI 2.2 to 3.6), while in 2007, the highest excess rate was in those aged 65 years or older (9.5/100,000, 95% CI 6.2 to 12.8).

CONCLUSION: While influenza was diagnosed more frequently and peak use of intensive care was higher during the epidemic of pandemic influenza in 2009, overall excess admissions to intensive care for respiratory illness was much greater during the influenza season in 2007. Thus, the impact of seasonal influenza on intensive care use may have previously been under-recognised. In 2009, high ICU use among young to middle aged adults was offset by relatively low use among older adults, and Aboriginal people and pregnant women were substantially over-represented in ICUs. Greater emphasis on prevention of serious illness in Aboriginal people and pregnant women should be a priority in pandemic planning.","output":"The impact of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 compared with seasonal influenza on intensive care admissions in New South Wales, Australia, 2007 to 2010: a time series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the current empirical landscape of police responses to people in mental health crisis as a backdrop, this methods paper makes an argument for the central role of collaborative co-design and production by diverse community experts and stakeholders to build transformative specialized training for frontline officers.

Lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory failure. Methods: Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19. We performed drug repositioning analysis to identify drug candidates that reverse gene expression pattern in L1000 lung cell line HCC515 treated with ACE2 inhibitor. We confirmed these drug candidates by similar bioinformatics analysis using lung tissues from patients deceased from COVID-19. We further investigated deregulated genes and pathways related to lung injury, as well as the gene-pathway-drug candidate relationships.

Further bioinformatics analysis shows that 12 significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues. These include signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and chemokine signaling pathways. All 12 pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares 11 of 12 pathways with COL-3 and common target genes such as RHOA. It also uniquely targets other genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. Conclusions: This study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and CGP-60474 have potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.","output":"Prediction of repurposed drugs for treating lung injury in COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease, affecting around 10 500 people in the UK. Precision medicines have been developed to treat specific CF-gene mutations. The newest, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELEX/TEZ/IVA), has been found to be highly effective in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and became available to a large proportion of UK CF patients in 2020. Understanding the potential health economic impacts of ELEX/TEZ/IVA is vital to planning service provision. METHODS We combined observational UK CF Registry data with RCT results to project the impact of ELEX/TEZ/IVA on total days of intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment at a population level. Registry data from 2015 to 2017 were used to develop prediction models for IV days over a 1-year period using several predictors, and to estimate 1-year population total IV days based on standards of care pre-ELEX/TEZ/IVA. We considered two approaches to imposing the impact of ELEX/TEZ/IVA on projected outcomes using effect estimates from RCTs: approach 1 based on effect estimates on FEV1% and approach 2 based on effect estimates on exacerbation rate. RESULTS ELEX/TEZ/IVA is expected to result in significant reductions in population-level requirements for IV antibiotics of 16.1% (~17 800 days) using approach 1 and 43.6% (~39 500 days) using approach 2. The two approaches require different assumptions. Increased understanding of the mechanisms through which ELEX/TEZ/IVA acts on these outcomes would enable further refinements to our projections. CONCLUSIONS This work contributes to increased understanding of the changing healthcare needs of people with CF and illustrates how Registry data can be used in combination with RCT evidence to estimate population-level treatment impacts.","output":"Projecting the impact of triple CFTR modulator therapy on intravenous antibiotic requirements in cystic fibrosis using patient registry data combined with treatment effects from randomised trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le confinement et le contexte sanitaire lis au COVID-19 peuvent entrainer une peur, une anxit ou des troubles psychologiques sapparentant  un syndrome de stress post traumatique (SSPT) Les patients traits pour un cancer apparaissent dautant plus  risque de SSPT quils doivent faire face  la fois  leur pathologie grave et  la peur de dvelopper une forme svre de COVID-19 dans un contexte social peu favorable pour les soutenir Dans le cadre de ltude COVIPACT, notre objectif tait de dcrire au cours du temps la prvalence des sympt?mes de SSPT chez les patients atteints de cancer, en lien avec des caractristiques cliniques (date de diagnostic de cancer, traitements, adaptations de prise en charge lies  la pandmie COVID-19) et des mesures dtat de sant auto-dclares (qualit de vie, insomnie et cognition) Mthodes Ltude COVIPACT (NCT04366154) a inclus 734 patients traits pour un cancer solide ou hmatologique et re?us en h?pital de jour pendant la premire priode de confinement dans les deux Centres de lutte contre le cancer de Normandie Les donnes cliniques ont t recueillies dans les dossiers mdicaux Des questionnaires valids ont permis de mesurer le stress post-traumatique (dfini par un score  lchelle IES-R 33), la qualit de vie (FACT-G, chelle 0-108), linsomnie (ISI, chelle 0-28) et la cognition (FACT-Cog PCI, chelle 0-72)  linclusion (pendant le premier confinement, avril/mai 2020),  trois mois (dconfinement, juillet/ao?t 2020) et  six mois (pendant le deuxime confinement, octobre/novembre 2020) Les facteurs associs au SSPT  linclusion et  son volution au cours du temps ont t recherchs par des modles de rgression logistique  effets fixes et mixtes (prenant en compte la corrlation intra-individuelle entre mesures rptes) Rsultats Les 578 (79 %) patients COVIPACT ayant rpondu aux questionnaires  linclusion avaient en mdiane 64 ans et 72 % taient des femmes Prs de 95 % des patients prsentaient une tumeur solide, dont la localisation primitive tait principalement le sein (44 %), les poumons, la tte et le cou (20 %), le systme digestif (17 %) et lappareil gnital fminin (11 %) et dont 59 % avaient un cancer mtastatique Un SSPT a t observ chez 21,3 % des patients au premier confinement (n=120/565), 13,6 % des patients au moment du dconfinement (n=46/339) et 23,5 % des patients durant le deuxime confinement (n=76/322 ;p&lt;0,001 pour effet du temps sur SSPT) Les femmes et les patients dont la prise en charge avait t adapte face  la pandmie COVID-19 (ex : report/interruption de cures, tl/visio consultations) prsentaient plus frquemment un SSPT  linclusion (OR [IC 95 %]=2,08 [1,26-3,56] et 1,75 [1,12-2,70], respectivement), mais pas au cours du suivi Aucune autre variable clinique ntait associe au SSPT ou  son volution A tous les temps, les patients exprimant un SSPT avaient aussi plus dinsomnie (ISI mdian chez les patients avec versus sans SSPT =15 versus 7  linclusion, 15 versus 8  trois mois, 16 versus 8  six mois), une moindre qualit de vie (FACT-G mdian=61 versus 79, 63 versus 79, 60 versus 80) et une moindre cognition per?ue (FACT-Cog PCI=52 versus 66, 55 versus 63, 47 versus 65  linclusion, trois mois et six mois respectivement) Conclusion Pendant les priodes de confinement lies  la COVID-19, un SSPT se manifeste chez plus dun patient sur cinq en cours de prise en charge dun cancer, et est fortement reli  la qualit de vie, au sommeil et  la cognition per?us","output":"Stress post-traumatique chez les patients traits pour un cancer au cours de la pandmie COVID-19 : rsultats de ltude COVIPACT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article focuses on focuses on COVID-19 and social work, identifying weaknesses in the welfare, health, and educational systems with places, and organizations where social workers are key players.

COVID-19 has had and will continue to have important consequences on wellness and burnout for EM physicians in Canada. Baseline data are crucial to monitor the health of EM physicians in Canada, and evaluate any interventions designed to help during and after COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To describe the rates of burnout, depression, and suicidality in practicing EM physicians in Canada, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A modified snowball method was used for survey distribution. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Health Services Tool (MBI-HSS), a screening measure for depression (PHQ-9), and a question regarding if the physician had ever or in the past 12 months contemplated suicide. RESULTS: A total of 384 respondent surveys were included in the final analysis: 86.1% (329/382) met at least one of the criteria for burnout, 58% (217/374) scored minimal to none on the PHQ-9 screening tool for depression, 14.3% (53/371) had contemplated suicide during their staff career in EM, and of those, 5.9% (22/371) had actively considered suicide in the past year. CONCLUSION: Canadian EM physicians just before the COVID-19 pandemic had an alarming number of respondents meet the threshold for burnout, confirming EM as a high-risk specialty.

The highest mortality is found between 80 and 89 years old. Why do these patients have a higher risk of severe COVID-19? In this narrative review we address potential mechanisms regarding viral transmission, physical reserve and the immune system, increasing the severity of this infection in elderly patients. OBSERVATIONS: First, the spread of COVID-19 may be enhanced in elderly patients. Viral shedding may be increased, and early identification may be complicated due to atypical disease presentation and limited testing capacity. Applying hygiene and quarantine measures, especially in patients with cognitive disorders including dementia, can be challenging. Additionally, elderly patients have a decreased cardiorespiratory reserve and are more likely to have co-morbidity including atherosclerosis, rendering them more susceptible to complications. The aging innate and adaptive immune system is weakened, while there is a pro-inflammatory tendency. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system on cytokine production and T-cells, further seem to aggravate this pro-inflammatory tendency, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, increasing disease severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The combination of all factors mentioned above contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 in the older patient. While larger studies of COVID-19 in elderly patients are needed, understanding the factors increasing disease severity may improve care and preventative measures to protect the elderly patient at risk for (severe) COVID-19 in the future.","output":"How does SARS-CoV-2 targets the elderly patients?

Overwhelming Coronavirus-Disease-2019 (COVID-19) respiratory failure placed tremendous demands on healthcare systems increasing the death toll. Cost-effective prognostic tools to characterize COVID-19 patients' likely to progress to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure are still needed. Design We conducted a retrospective cohort study to develop a model utilizing demographic and clinical data collected in the first 12-hours admission to explore associations with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in unvaccinated and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Setting University based healthcare system including 6 hospitals located in the Galveston, Brazoria and Harris counties of Texas. Participants Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to one of six hospitals between March 19th and June 31st, 2020. Primary outcome The primary outcome was defined as reaching a WHO ordinal scale between 6-9 at any time during admission, which corresponded to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high-flow oxygen supplementation or mechanical ventilation. Results We included 329 participants in the model cohort and 62 (18.8%) met the primary outcome. Our multivariable regression model found that lactate dehydrogenase (OR 3.38 (95% CI 2.04-5.59)), qSOFA score (OR: 2.24 (95% CI 1.22-4.12)), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (OR:1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14)), age (OR: 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.07)), BMI (OR: 1.08 (95% CI1.03-1.13)), oxygen saturation or admission SpO2 (OR: 0.91 (95% CI 0.83-0.99)), and admission date (OR: 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-0.99)).

If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this paper, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of the reproduction number of COVID-19 in China and the United States. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary tracks of the epidemics in China and the United States, both of which are in accordance with that of the real incident cases.","output":"Maximum entropy method for estimating the reproduction number: An investigation for COVID-19 in China and the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ion-conductive hydrogels with intrinsic biocompatibility, stretchability, and stimuli-responsive capability have attracted considerable attention because of their extensive application potential in wearable sensing devices.

However, currently, hydrogel film is rarely reported because it can be easily wrinkled, torn, and dehydrated, which severely hinders its development in microelectronics. Herein, thin, stretchable, and transparent ion-conductive double-network hydrogel films with controllable thickness are integrated with stretchable elastomer substrates, which show good environmental stability and ultrahigh sensitivity to humidity (78,785.5%/% relative humidity (RH)). Benefiting from the ultrahigh surface-area-to-volume ratio, abundant active sites, and short diffusion distance, the hydrogel film humidity sensor exhibits 2  10(5) times increased response to 98% RH, as well as 5.9 and 7.6 times accelerated response and recovery speeds compared with the bulk counterpart, indicating its remarkable thickness-dependent humidity-sensing properties. The humidity-sensing mechanism reveals that the adsorption of water improves the ion migration and dielectric constant, as well as establishes the electrical double layer. Furthermore, the noncontact human-machine interaction and real-time respiratory frequency detection are enabled by the sensors.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a quality improvement project at a single academic medical center. Onsite vaccination was available once a week at 2 high-risk obstetrical clinics staffed by obstetrical residents, maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) fellows, and MFM attendings were selected for our vaccine pilot program. Onsite vaccinations were immediately available for use in the clinic starting May 11, 2021. Data were collected over a 4-week period (April 27, 2021, to May 20, 2021), which included 4 clinic days before onsite vaccine availability (April 27, 2021 to May 10, 2021) and 4 days with onsite vaccine availability (May 11, 2021, to May 20, 2021). Patients were considered exposed to onsite vaccination if they had any clinic visits during the latter 2 weeks of the study period. All patients were counseled by providers at each visit using our institution's standardized COVID-19 vaccination discussion tool designed for pregnant and breastfeeding patients.5 Counseling was documented in each patient's chart per the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Before and throughout the study period, pregnancy was listed as a qualifying condition for priority vaccination in Missouri and Illinois. At this time, vaccinations were readily available in the local area surrounding our clinical space. Data on vaccine administration were collected via the Missouri and Illinois state databases over a period of 1 month after the pilot program was closed, allowing for the collection of data on patients who pursued vaccination offsite for scheduling or personal reasons. This project was deemed exempt by the Office for Human Research Protections. RESULTS: We reviewed data from 124 clinic visits, where a total of 93 individual patients were seen in the 4-week period; 6 had previously been vaccinated at external sites and the remaining 87 were eligible (Figure). The majority of our patient population was non-Hispanic Black women with public or no insurance (Table). Of the 32 eligible patients seen and counseled before onsite vaccination availability, 1 (3%) proceeded to receive the vaccination offsite. Of the 55 eligible patients seen and counseled after onsite vaccination availability, 2 (3%) proceeded with onsite vaccination and an additional 4 (7%) proceeded with vaccination offsite. Onsite vaccination availability did not significantly increase the vaccination rates (3% vs 11%; P=.22). Of the 55 eligible patients counseled during onsite vaccination availability, 25 were seen and counseled exclusively during the onsite vaccination pilot period and none of these patients accepted onsite vaccination or pursued vaccination offsite. CONCLUSION: Because only 3% of eligible, high-risk obstetrical patients proceeded with onsite vaccination, our experience suggests that vaccine hesitancy, not availability, is a critical driver of the low vaccination rates in this population. Although a larger sample size may have demonstrated statistical difference, the overall low vaccination uptake rate forced the closure of our pilot program over concerns for wasted vaccination doses. In a population at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, only 14% of our study population was vaccinated, whereas Missouri reported a 41% vaccination rate during this time.6 These findings suggest that increased access alone may not improve vaccination rates in obstetrical patients even after counseling by expert clinicians. These findings are limited by the pre/post nature of the comparison, exposing the sample to bias as vaccination recommendations and population sentiment was rapidly evolving during this time period. However, the consistency of counseling and patient population provided by a single clinical setting limited other sources of bias during the study period. Vaccine hesitancy is multifactorial and complex and urgently requires more evaluation in this high-risk population. Vaccine hesitancy in pregnancy is well documented, but early reports suggest that the COVID-19 vaccination uptake rate is markedly lower than that of other vaccines during pregnancy. Our finding that none of the women who were seen exclusively during the onsite vaccination period accepted vaccination may suggest that repeat clinic visits and the associated establishment of rapport and trust is a vital part of vaccine decision making. Earlier intervention, before patient views on novel therapeutics such as vaccinations can be formulated and fixed, may aid in uptake. Further qualitative work and inclusion of pregnant women in vaccine trials is an initial step.","output":"Offering onsite COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk obstetric patients: Initial Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM In recent years, platelet-related markers were recognized as useful prognostic factors in various malignancies.

This assumes importance not only in outreach clinics but also in the ongoing pandemic caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus, where social distancing is advocated to contain the spread. We aimed to compare the axial ACD in PXF and normal patients by SACD, and its agreement with the anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) and LenstarLS-900. METHODS: A prospective comparative observational study was done at a tertiary eye care hospital. A PXF group and a normal group of controls were recruited. All eyes were phakic with normal cornea. Any eye with previous intraocular/refractive surgery and cause of other secondary or uncontrolled glaucoma was excluded. SACD was measured clinically via slit-lamp method and also via ASOCT and Lenstar; agreement between the methodologies was plotted. RESULTS: Fifty patients were recruited in each group. Mean age was 66.82  4.88 years in PXF patients and 65  5.46 years in controls (P = 0.2). ACD was found to be greater in controls compared with the PXF patients; this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001) across all methodologies. A good agreement with narrow 95% limits of agreement was found between these methodologies.

However, less is known about how per capita alcohol sales, which predict population-level alcohol use, have changed and whether changes in alcohol sales differ from changes in sales of other products due to pandemic factors. METHODS: We obtained monthly retail sales data by industry from Statistics Canada, for the six largest provinces in Canada (containing 93% of the national population), between January 2010 and November 2020, representing time before and 9 months after the start of the pandemic in Canada. We used an interrupted time series analysis to estimate pandemic impacts on the dollar value of monthly per capita (per individuals 15+ years) alcohol, essential and non-essential retail sales. We adjusted our analyses for pre-pandemic sales trends, inflation, seasonality and changing population demographics over time. RESULTS: During the first 9 months of the pandemic, the values of per capita alcohol, essential and non-essential sales were, respectively, 13.2% higher, 3.6% higher and 13.1% lower than the average values during the same period in the prior 3 years. Interrupted time series models showed significant level change for the value of monthly per capita alcohol sales (+$4.86, 95% CIs: 2.88, 6.83), essential sales (?$59.80, 95% CIs: ? 78.47, ? 41.03) and non-essential sales (?$308.70, 95% CIs: ? $326.60, ? 290.79) during the pandemic. Alcohol sales were consistently elevated during the pandemic, and the pre- and post-pandemic slopes were comparable. In contrast, essential and non-essential retail sales declined in the early months of the pandemic before returning to regular spending levels. CONCLUSION: During the first 9 months of the pandemic, per capita alcohol sales were moderately elevated in Canada. In contrast, non-essential sales were lower than prior years, driven by large decreases during the initial months of the pandemic. These findings suggest that the pandemic was associated with increased population-level alcohol consumption, which may lead to increased alcohol-related harms.

With mixed-effects logistic regression models, we assessed the probability of screening positive for ethyl glucuronide according to patients' main clinical characteristics and time of analysis (either prior to or after a lockdown was implemented in Spain). RESULTS: A total of 362 patients provided 2,040 urine samples (1,295 prior to lockdown, 745 during lockdown). The mean age of participants was 52.0 years (SD 12.6), and 69.2% were men.

Prolonged use results in neurobiological changes in the cerebral area, activating the \\"reward system,\\" leading to development of drug-seeking behaviors and upregulating proinflammatory cytokines, as well as growth factors [2,3]. The immune system's response inducing Covid-19 virus even to moderate symptoms by adapting the immunomodulation, seems to lead to an inflammatory process, especially in patients with pre-existing production of inflammatory agents, such as patients with SUD [4]. Objective: The investigation of biopsychosocial responses of the Covid-19 pandemic in patients under medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with methadone and buprenorphine and their correlation to biological factors. Material and Methods: 64 patients with Covid-19 were included in the study sample, 26 (40.6%) under methadone administration and 38 (59.4%) under buprenorphine ones. The Control group consisted of patients with SUD that had not been infected by the virus and Covid-19 patients without previous history of substance use. Blood samples were obtained in both groups to determine C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, IFNa1, IFNa2, IFN, IL-1a, IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, MCP-1, TNF-a, but in patients with Covid-19, blood samples were obtained at the first, seventh and sixteenth day after infection. The sample with SUD had completed a structured questionnaire (Medication-Assisted Treatment Questionnaire Covid-19 C MATQ/Covid-19) about Covid-19 effect in terms of medications administration (methadone and buprenorphine) and psychosocial life. Statistical significance was ascertained by t-tests, ANOVA and Pearson's x2 test as appropriate. Results: Reduced management of medications at take-home doses (p<0.05) and physical dysfunctions (p<0.05) were observed in both groups with SUD. Regarding the patients under methadone treatment, social isolation (p<0.05) and the need for psychosocial support from the therapeutic programs (p<0.001) were found increased. According to the results, the values of cortisol, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly elevated (p<0.05) in the study sample compared to the control group. Furthermore, biological factors on the 7th and 16th day after Covid-19 infection (cortisol, IL-1b, IL-8, TNF-a, MCP-1, IL-6) in methadone administration were significantly increased (p<0.05) while greater values of CRP (p<0.05) on the first and seventh day were observed in the buprenorphine group. In respect of the findings, the IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly increased in the methadone group compared to the buprenorphine group. Moreover, increased values of IL-8 and MCP-1 positively were correlated with the need for psychosocial support, drug-seeking behavior and relapse. Conclusions: In conclusion, the Covid-19 virus negatively influences the immune system in patients under substitution treatment. Although methadone and buprenorphine are key substances as MAT, they seem able to exacerbate the dysregulated cellular functions due to the Covid-19 virus and, thus, lead progressively in drug-seeking behaviors and relapsing disorders.

The nanotoxicity affects the range between induction of cellular stress and cytotoxicity. The reasons so far reported for these toxicological effects are due to their variable sizes with high surface areas, shape, charge, and physicochemical properties, which upon interaction with the biological components may influence their functioning and result in adverse outcomes (AO). Thus, understanding the risk produced by these materials now is an important safety concern for the development of nanotechnology and nanomedicine. Since the time nanotoxicology has evolved, the methods employed have been majorly relied on in vitro cell-based evaluations, while these simple methods may not predict the complexity involved in preclinical and clinical conditions concerning pharmacokinetics, organ toxicity, and toxicities evidenced through multiple cellular levels. The safety profiles of nanoscale nanomaterials and nanoformulations in the delivery of drugs and therapeutic applications are of considerable concern. In addition, the safety assessment for new nanomedicine formulas lacks regulatory standards. Though the in vivo studies are greatly needed, the end parameters used for risk assessment are not predicting the possible toxic effects produced by various nanoformulations. On the other side, due to increased restrictions on animal usage and demand for the need for high-throughput assays, there is a need for developing and exploring novel methods to evaluate NPs safety concerns. The progress made in molecular biology and the availability of several modern techniques may offer novel and innovative methods to evaluate the toxicological behavior of different NPs by using single cells, cell population, and whole organisms. This review highlights the recent novel methods developed for the evaluation of the safety impacts of NPs and attempts to solve the problems that come with risk assessment.

While WHO mentioned only chronic respiratory diseases, not specifically asthma as a risk factor for severe illness. There has been asthma prevalence discrepancy in studies of COVID-19 across the world. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to investigate the association between asthma and composite poor outcome in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles with adult COVID-19 patients > 18 years old and had information related to asthma as a risk factor. Studies with outcomes consisting of mortality, severe COVID-19, use of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and hospital admission were included in this study. The outcomes of interest were divided into severe COVID-19, mortality and other poor outcomes. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in meta-analysis with a total of 6,046 patients. Asthma was not associated with composite poor outcomes with OR = 0.92 (95%CI 0.71-1.19, p = 0.61, and I2 = 8.49%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed that asthma was not associated with severe COVID (p = 0.76), mortality (p = 0.45), and other poor outcomes (p = 0.28).

One mechanism for incorporating LC into practice is to attend an LC course (LCC). Postcourse mentorship is recommended by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), in addition to course participation, to encourage adoption of the new techniques. Recommendations also include access to at least 25 colectomies annually. Because the use of LC likely will increase, access to mentorship is an important consideration for LCC participants. This study aimed to evaluate mentorship access and related factors for participants in an ongoing LCC. METHODS Participants in seven consecutive single-center LCCs were anonymously surveyed regarding age, specialty, surgical experience, practice, and mentorship availability. Factors associated with mentorship were identified via chi-square and univariate logistic regression. RESULTS Of the 90 participants surveyed, 81 (90%) were men, 51 (56.7%) were general surgeons, 43 (48.9%) were older than 40 years, and 49 (54.4%) had access to a mentor. A majority of the participants (86.7%) performed five or fewer open colorectal cases per month, and 81 (90%) performed five or fewer noncolorectal advanced laparoscopic cases monthly. Factors associated with lack of mentor access included age older than 40 years (P = 0.004), practice as a general surgeon (P = 0.014), and status as a senior attending surgeon (P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS A significant number of surgeons (45.6%) participating in LCC have limited or no access to mentors. In particular, older surgeons, senior attending surgeons, and general surgeons have the least access to mentors. To encourage adoption of LC, training methods should be adopted that accommodate general surgeons, surgeons with a limited advanced laparoscopic case load, and surgeons without access to mentors.

Most respiratory tract infections are self-limiting and require no specific treatment. However, patients often use different self-medication therapies that can treat both the symptoms and the cause. Throat lozenges with a fixed combination of benzydamine hydrochloride and cetypiridinium chloride (BH/CPC) have been shown to provide effective symptomatic relief for sore throat, but their effect on viruses has not been investigated to date. The antiseptic, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), has already been described as a successful bactericide. In addition, there are some studies suggesting its efficacy against certain enveloped viruses. Thus, the aim of our study was to examine the virucidal activity of CPC and a combination of BH/CPC as a free active substance or as lozenge on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Under in-laboratory simulated conditions of lozenge administration, we incubated SARS-CoV-2 with three different concentrations of each of the active substances, CPC, free BH/CPC or BH/CPC, as a lozenge suspension for 1 min, 5 min and 15 min of contact time. Infective viral particles were detected in cell cultures and the viral titre was calculated accordingly. Our results show that all active substances in high-concentration suspensions, as well as a medium concentration of the BH/CPC combination, exhibited a 4-log reduction in viral titre. Additionally, the highest concentration of BH/CPC as a lozenge had a faster virucidal effect compared to CPC as a free active substance alone, since a contact time as short as 1 min reduced the initial virus concentration by more than 4-log. This study demonstrates the effective strong virucidal effect of the lozenge, with the possibility of viral load reduction in the oral cavity and, consequently, reduced risk of viral transmission.","output":"A Throat Lozenge with Fixed Combination of Cetylpyridinium Chloride and Benzydamine Hydrochloride Has Direct Virucidal Effect on SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Several studies have suggested that accommodative and non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions are commonly encountered in optometric practice.

Probably, this deterioration of the mental health situation is partly due to declines in physical activity. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in and the association between affective wellbeing and levels of different domains of physical activity at three time points before and during the pandemic. METHOD: We used a nationwide online panel with a trend data design encompassing a total sample of N = 3517, representing the German population (> 14 years). Four different activity domains (sport and exercise, light outdoor activity, housework/gardening, active travel) and affective wellbeing (positive and negative affect) were assessed at three time points before and during the Covid-19 pandemic (October 2019, March 2020, October 2020). RESULTS: Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) indicate differences regarding affective wellbeing over the three time points with the lowest values at the second time point. Levels of activity in the four domains differed significantly over time with the strongest decrease for sport and exercise from the first to the second time point. Partial correlations indicated that the relationships between sport and exercise and positive affect were most consistent over time. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that physical activity plays a particularly important role in the pandemic period as a protective factor against poor mental health.

They are also a prominent cause of multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections, and some species are recognized as biothreat pathogens. Tools for noninvasive, whole-body analysis that can localize a pathogen with specificity are needed, but no such technology currently exists. We previously demonstrated that positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-sorbitol (18F-FDS) can selectively detect Enterobacterales infections in murine models. Here, we demonstrate that uptake of 18F-FDS by bacteria occurs via a metabolically conserved sorbitol-specific pathway with rapid in vitro 18F-FDS uptake noted in clinical strains, including MDR isolates. Whole-body 18F-FDS PET/computerized tomography (CT) in 26 prospectively enrolled patients with either microbiologically confirmed Enterobacterales infection or other pathologies demonstrated that 18F-FDS PET/CT was safe, could rapidly detect and localize Enterobacterales infections due to drug-susceptible or MDR strains, and differentiated them from sterile inflammation or cancerous lesions. Repeat imaging in the same patients monitored antibiotic efficacy with decreases in PET signal correlating with clinical improvement. To facilitate the use of 18F-FDS, we developed a self-contained, solid-phase cartridge to rapidly (<10 min) formulate ready-to-use 18F-FDS from commercially available 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) at room temperature.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent PCI in England between January 2017 and April 2020 in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database. RESULTS: Forty-four hospitals reported PCI procedures for 126 491 patients. There were &#8776;700 procedures performed each week before the lockdown. After the March 23, 2020 lockdown (11th/12th week in 2020), there was a 49% fall in the number of PCI procedures after the 12th week in 2020. The decrease was greatest in PCI procedures performed for stable angina (66%), followed by non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (45%), and ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (33%). Patients after the lockdown were younger (64.5 versus 65.5 years, P<0.001) and less likely to have diabetes (20.4% versus 24.6%, P<0.001), hypertension (52.0% versus 56.8%, P=0.001), previous myocardial infarction (23.5% versus 26.7%, P=0.008), previous PCI (24.3% versus 28.3%, P=0.001), or previous coronary artery bypass graft (4.6% versus 7.2%, P<0.001) compared with before the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown in England has resulted in a significant decline in PCI procedures. Fewer patients underwent PCI for stable angina.

The objective of this study was to estimate the total discounted money value of human life losses (TDMVCL(MAURITIUS)) associated with COVID-19 in Mauritius. Methods: The human capital approach (HCA) was used to estimate the TDMVCL(MAURITIUS) of the 10 human life losses linked with COVID-19 in Mauritius as of 16 October 2020. The HCA model was estimated with the national life expectancy of 75.51 years and a discount rate of 3%. A sensitivity analysis was performed assuming (a) 5 and 10% discount rates, and (b) the average world life expectancy of 73.2 years, and the world highest life expectancy of 88.17 years. Results: The money value of human lives lost to COVID-19, at a discounted rate of 3%, had an estimated TDMVCL(MAURITIUS) of Int$ 3,120,689, and an average of Int$ 312,069 per human life lost. Approximately 74% of the TDMVCL(MAURITIUS) accrued to persons aged between 20 and 59 years. Reanalysis of the model with 5 and 10% discount rates, holding national life expectancy constant, reduced the TDMVCL(MAURITIUS) by 19.0 and 45.5%, respectively.

Any effort to reduce the percentage of patients with a diagnosis of nephropathy heading towards kidney replacement therapies should therefore be encouraged. Besides early genetic screenings and registries, in vitro systems that mimic the complexity and pathophysiological aspects of the disease could advance the screening for targeted and personalized therapies. In this regard, the use of patient-derived cell lines, as well as the generation of disease-specific cell lines via gene editing and stem cell technologies, have significantly improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying inherited kidney diseases. Furthermore, organs-on-chip technology holds great potential as it can emulate tissue and organ functions that are not found in other, more simple, in vitro models. The personalized nature of the chips, together with physiologically relevant read-outs, provide new opportunities for patient-specific assessment, as well as personalized strategies for treatment. In this review, we summarize the major kidney-on-chip (KOC) configurations and present the most recent studies on the in vitro representation of genetic kidney diseases using KOC-driven strategies.","output":"Organs-on-chip technology: a tool to tackle genetic kidney diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Parastomal hernia is a common complication following stoma creation. The surgical approaches included local repair by suture, stoma relocation and mesh-based techniques; but none has been able to provide satisfactory results. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 60-year-old asian female was referred complaining of abdominal pain and constipation caused by recurrent parastomal hernia of an end stoma. She had undergone total cystectomy with creation of an ileal conduit at the age of 53 years, and laparoscopic sigmoid colostomy at the age of 55 years. Parastomal hernia of an end stoma had developed postoperatively, and she had undergone recreation of colostomy at the same place with fasciorrhaphy at the age of 59 years, but parastomal hernia recurred 6 months later because of split fascia sutures. Laparoscopic repair for recurrent parastomal hernia was conducted using the sandwich technique while preserving an ileal conduit. The patient has been followed postoperatively for more than 3 years without any sign of recurrence. DISCUSSION Although further cases are required to get definitive conclusions, we suppose that the laparoscopic sandwich technique can be useful for parastomal hernia. CONCLUSION We herein report a case of recurrent parastomal hernia treated laparoscopically while preserving an ileal conduit using the sandwich technique which combines the keyhole and Sugarbaker techniques. This is a quite rare case report of laparoscopic repair for recurrent parastomal hernia in a patient with an ileal conduit.","output":"Laparoscopic repair for recurrent parastomal hernia of an end stoma using the sandwich technique while preserving an ileal conduit: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: In addition to its respiratory impact of SARS-CoV2, skin lesions of probable vascular origin have been described. This study intends to quantify the incidence of acro-ischemic lesions in COVID-19 infected adult subjects in our population, describing clinical patterns and associated findings. Methods: All adult confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection who presented with acro-ischemic lesions and received care in our institution were prospectively enrolled up to May 15th, 2020. The variables included demographics, comorbidities, analytical parameters, clinical presentations and COVID-19 treatment. Results: We enrolled 24 patients. The overall rate of acro-ischemic findings in COVID-19 patients was 1.2% [0.6% for outpatients and 2.9% for hospitalized (ICU and non-ICU patients)], but the observed incidence for acro-ischemia in ICU patients was remarkably higher (23.0%, p<0.001). We have described four different clinical patterns of acroischemia: atypical Raynauds phenomenon (ARP), (4); pseudo-pernio (PP), (5); severe microcirculatory ischemia with preserved pulse (SMI), (6); and dry gangrene with arteriosclerosis obliterans (AO), (9). Kendalls &#964; correlation with lung disease severity was 0.877 (95% CI, 0.756 to 0.968); p<0.01). ARP individuals were predominantly female, while SMI appeared lately in elderly hospitalized subjects with better prognosis. AO occurred in patients with more comorbidity and younger than those with SMI. We observed other associated lesions of suggestive ischemic nature in other organs in all groups (15 patients of total sample). Plasma procalcitonin was significantly higher in patients who developed SMI (median and interquartile range: 9.99 (4.2, 12.3) mg/mL vs 0.26 (0.11, 0.89) mg/mL; p<0.001), and D-dimer level at hospital admission was significantly higher in AO patients (median and interquartile range: 1166 (1050, 2111) mg/L vs 502 (448, 777) mg/L; p<0.001). Conclusion: The observed risk for acroischemia in COVID-19 is high in ICU patients (23%).

Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were recruited via social media and invited to participate in an online survey released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. FINDINGS: While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family's health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women's partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree. CONCLUSION: This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further service changes and future service redesign. New evidence provided offers unique insight into key stakeholders' experiences of the rapid changes to health services.","output":"Experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: A five-cohort cross-sectional comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":".","output":"Ultrasonography and SARS-CoV 2 infection: a review of what we know and do not yet know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease rapidly spreading around the world, raising global public health concerns.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) provide the first line of defense against any disease outbreak. Thus, the present study is designed to assess HCWs' attitudes towards, knowledge of, and awareness of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using an online survey on social media; the participants were 597 adults. The study was conducted from March to April 2020. The questionnaire was randomly administered on Arabic-language social media applications; the 26-item survey assessed knowledge levels, attitudes, and practices. RESULTS: The analysis includes 597 complete responses from HCWs; participants included physicians, nurses, medical students, and pharmacists. Most participants were females aged 18 to 25 years. Most participants agreed that the virus can spread via direct and indirect contact. Most participants indicated that they wash their hands; avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth; and avoid crowded places to protect themselves against infection. Most indicated that a bat was the original source of the virus. Most participating HCWs indicated that the symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Most of the participants also indicated that there is no specific treatment for patients infected with COVID-19.

METHODS The authors conducted a cross-sectional study utilizing an online survey to assess the attitudes of pharmacists and other health care providers toward their role as immunization providers and perceived barriers to providing immunizations. The survey was distributed between November 2018 and February 2019. RESULTS Two hundred thirty-six pharmacists and 51 other health care providers completed the survey. Of the pharmacists who responded, 203 (86%) provided immunizations. Most respondents (97.9% of pharmacists and 90.2% of other health care providers) see vaccinations as a shared professional responsibility. Both pharmacists (82.6%) and other health care providers (79.6%) believe pharmacists have adequate training to administer vaccines to patients. Immunizing pharmacists identified 2 primary barriers to providing immunizations: patients refusing vaccines for financial reasons (55%) and patients not having insurance coverage for vaccines received in a pharmacy (55%). In contrast, the primary barrier identified by non-immunizing pharmacists is other responsibilities taking precedence over vaccinating (75%). Other health care providers identified determining whether their patients' insurance will reimburse for a vaccine (52%) as their primary barrier toward providing immunizations. CONCLUSION These surveys provide a baseline measure of the attitudes of Wisconsin pharmacists and other health care providers toward immunization provision and offer opportunities for comparison.

We hypothesized that practices about ventilation during CPR might be heterogeneous and may differ worldwide. To address this question, we surveyed physicians from several countries on their practices during CPR. METHODS We used a Web-based opinion survey. Links to the survey were sent by e-mail newsletters and displayed on the Web sites of medical societies involved in CPR practice from December 2013 to March 2014. RESULTS 1,328 surveys were opened, and 548 were completed (41%). Responses came from 54 countries, but 64% came from 6 countries. Responders were mostly physicians (89%). From this group, 97% declared following specific CPR guidelines. Regarding practices, 28% declared always or frequently adopting only continuous chest compressions without additional ventilation. With regard to mechanical chest compression devices, 38% responded that such devices were available to them; when used, 28% declared always or frequently experiencing problems with ventilation such as frequent alarms. During bag-mask ventilation in intubated patients, 18% declared stopping chest compression during insufflation, and 39% applied > 10 breaths/min, which conflicts with international CPR guidelines. When a ventilator was used, the volume controlled mode was the most common strategy cited, but there was heterogeneity regarding ventilator settings for PEEP, trigger, FIO2 , and breathing frequency. SpO2 and end-tidal CO2 were the 2 most monitored variables cited. CONCLUSIONS Physicians indicated heterogeneous practices that often differ significantly from international CPR guidelines.

Therefore, the requirement of real-world analysis has become crucial. Propensity score methods, which have provided great values in observational studies over the years, are frequently used to estimate causal treatment effects. However, these methods are not without their challenges and limitations. In this study, an alternative technique to propensity score called sample substitution method has been proposed for multi-group comparison in real-world evidence analysis.

SETTING Tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS A total of 104 women with a uterine weight >500 g who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy using a manual morcellation technique. INTERVENTION Manual morcellation was done extracorporeally, within a partially exteriorized specimen bag, using a scalpel under direct visualization by the operating surgeon. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 104 laparoscopic hysterectomies were performed in women with a uterus weighing >500 g using a manual morcellation technique for specimen extraction. The median patient age was 48.1 years (range, 34-69 years), and the median body mass index was 31.0 kg/m(2) (range, 19.1-56.7 kg/m(2)). The median blood loss and specimen weight were 200 mL (range, 20-1200 mL) and 741.5 g (range, 500-1930 g), respectively. Morcellation was performed through an abdominal approach in 58.7% of the patients and through a vaginal approach in 41.3%.

A common animal model used to study different facets of psychiatric disorders is social isolation from early life on. In rats, this isolation can induce long-lasting alterations in molecular expression and in behavior. Since social isolation models severe psychiatric symptoms, it is to be expected that it affects the overall wellbeing of the animals. As also promoted by the 3Rs principle, though, it is pivotal to decrease the burden of laboratory animals by limiting the number of subjects (reduce, replace) and by improving the animals wellbeing (refine). The aim of this study was therefore to test possible refinement strategies such as resocialization and mere adult social isolation. We examined whether the alternatives still triggered the necessary phenotype while minimizing the stress load on the animals. Interestingly, we did not find reduced wellbeing-associated burrowing performance in isolated rats. The hyperactive phenotype seen in socially isolated animals was observed for rats undergoing the adult-only isolation, but resocializing ameliorated the locomotor abnormality. Isolation strongly affected markers of neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex independent of timing: mRNA levels of Arc, Bdnf and the pool of Bdnf transcripts with the 3 long UTR were reduced in all groups. Bdnf splice variant IV expression was reduced in lifelong-isolated animals. Some of these deficits normalized after resocialization; likewise, exon VI Bdnf mRNA levels were reduced only in animals persistently isolated. Conversely, social deprivation did not affect the expression of Gad67 and Pvb, two GABAergic markers, whereas changes occurred in the expression of dopamine d1 and d2 receptors. As adult isolation was sufficient to trigger the hyperactive phenotype and impaired neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex, it could be a candidate for a refinement strategy for certain research questions. To fully grade the severity of post-weaning social isolation and the alternatives, adult isolation and resocialization, a more profound and multimodal assessment approach is necessary.","output":"Social isolation in rats: Effects on animal welfare and molecular markers for neuroplasticity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to affect the globe.

of educators and students on Forced Online Distance Education during the Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lock-down. Such differences in views can be a source of misunderstanding, leading to unintended side effects. Online open-ended surveys resulted in 1341 comments received from 210 university educators and 347 students. The coding, based on the principles of Grounded Theory, resulted in 35 concepts, organized into 6 categories. The main findings were that students and educators shared most of the negative and positive views; however, there exist unique views that are not shared between the two groups. The negative views outweigh the positive ones, and educators are more negative than students. The category 'Perceived usefulness' is the most positive and 'Technology' the most negative category. Positive views were attributed to the quality of life, not the quality of the study. The most important contribution of the work to the existing body of knowledge is the comparative analysis of the unconstrained views of students and their educators about Online Learning Environments (OLE) as the workhorse of Forced Online Distance Education (FODE). The results of this study can be helpful for institutional evaluators, since they reveal undesirable side effects that are usually overlooked.

A lack of serologic tools has hindered targeted studies of transmission. METHODS We studied 26 index patients with MERS-CoV infection and their 280 household contacts. The median time from the onset of symptoms in index patients to the latest blood sampling in contact patients was 17.5 days (range, 5 to 216; mean, 34.4). Probable cases of secondary transmission were identified on the basis of reactivity in two reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays with independent RNA extraction from throat swabs or reactivity on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against MERS-CoV S1 antigen, supported by reactivity on recombinant S-protein immunofluorescence and demonstration of neutralization of more than 50% of the infectious virus seed dose on plaque-reduction neutralization testing. RESULTS Among the 280 household contacts of the 26 index patients, there were 12 probable cases of secondary transmission (4%; 95% confidence interval, 2 to 7). Of these cases, 7 were identified by means of RT-PCR, all in samples obtained within 14 days after the onset of symptoms in index patients, and 5 were identified by means of serologic analysis, all in samples obtained 13 days or more after symptom onset in index patients. Probable cases of secondary transmission occurred in 6 of 26 clusters (23%). Serologic results in contacts who were sampled 13 days or more after exposure were similar to overall study results for combined RT-PCR and serologic testing. CONCLUSIONS The rate of secondary transmission among household contacts of patients with MERS-CoV infection has been approximately 5%.

Unquestionably, countless dealers who had to shut their shops for weeks were hit hardest by the crisis. Similarly, consumers also face many difficulties, especially in emerging economies. At this time, e-commerce is the only available option that people can use to fulfill their needs. In developing states, people prefer to buy things from shops. Hence, it raises a concern about whether people will adopt e-commerce in the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aims to examine the consumers intention to adopt e-commerce by incorporating corona fear as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: The statistical techniques applied to the data set were confirmatory factor analysis and partial least square structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings depict that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norms, perceived lack of alternatives are positively and significantly connected with the intention to adopt e-commerce. However, perceived risk, perceived behavioral control and attitude have a positive but insignificant effect. Additionally, moderating analysis results depict that corona fear moderates the associations between perceived risk, perceived usefulness, subjective norms and attitude. However, no moderating effect is found in perceived ease of use and perceived behavioral control. Originality/value: The present research is the initial attempt that analyzes consumers intention to accept e-commerce during the corona pandemic in a country like Pakistan, where the trend of physical shopping is more favorable among consumers. Also, it includes the moderating role of corona fear to understand how this fear has shaped the consumers intention to shop online? Additionally, the technology acceptance model framework is expanded by including perceived risk and perceived lack of alternatives in the research model. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Corona fear and e-commerce adoption in an emerging economy: paradigm shift of consumer intention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diverse new azoloazines were synthesized from the reaction of fluorinated hydrazonoyl chlorides with heterocyclic thiones, 1,8\\\\diaminonaphthalene, ketene aminal derivatives, and 4\\\\amino\\\\5\\\\triflouromethyl\\\\1,2,4\\\\triazole\\\\2\\\\thiol.

Accordingly, characteristics of households in a region have been shown to relate to transmission heterogeneity of the virus. We introduce a discrete-time stochastic epidemiological model to examine the impact of the household size distribution in a region on the transmission dynamics. We choose parameters to reflect incidence in two health regions of the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate the impact of distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution the only different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause significant differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions drive distinct dynamics that match reported cases. Furthermore, our model suggests that offering individuals a place to isolate outside their household can speed the decline in cases, and does so more effectively where there are more larger households.","output":"Modelling the impact of household size distribution on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While the Covid-19 pandemic was spreading worldwide, the Italian government stated lockdown, with a drastic reorganization in of healthcare systems. The psychological and social effects of the pandemic and to the restrictions of freedom could have had a detrimental impact on people with physical disabilities, for whom well-being depends strongly on their social environment. AIM: Our main aim was to describe the overall impact of the pandemic on mental health, social condition and illness perception among patients with disabilities, to provide early interventions for this particularly vulnerable population. For this purpose, we performed a specific screening protocol to detect the prevalence of any psychological distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Telephonic interview administered to patients and their caregivers attending the Neurorehabilitation unit of the University Hospital of Pisa. POPULATION: 134 patients with physical disability related to neurological disorders, who had their outpatient appointment cancelled, because of the government dispositions, were enrolled. METHODS: A specific questionnaire (COVID19-q) was designed to test patients' psychosocial state, including a section addressed to the caregiver. Moreover, a standardized psychological evaluation, using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), was also performed. RESULTS: Results show a different impact in our study population compared to the general population on psychological aspect. Patients did not manifest any clinically relevant distress, as assessed with CORE-OM. However, patients with higher disability degree reported a statistically lower outcome in the social function and in the well-being domains and an increase in risk behaviour. Results from COVID19-q show that most of our patients reported none or mild change in their psycho-social habits and perception of illness during lockdown. However, reduction of family cohesion and lack of healthcare support are two important aspects that people with disability had to face with during the pandemic emergency. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: People with physical disabilities surprisingly shown milder effects of the pandemic on their psychological state and good coping skills in facing social isolation, manifesting resilience resources. However, the is a need to give concrete support to healthcare and social care, especially in the management of severe disability. This unexpected and reassuring result may reveal a worrying scenario regarding the social participation and quality of life of people with disabilities: were they already in lockdown?","output":"Psycho-social impact of social distancing and isolation due to the COVID-19 containment measures on patients with physical disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a novel approach for enumerating partial models of a propositional formula, inspired by how theory solvers and the SAT solver interact in lazy SMT.

In this way, we could improve GT efficiencies to up to a third of the inoculated cotyledons when using ttLbCas12a, which outperformed SaCas9 considerably. In addition, we could show that the conversion tract length of the GT reaction can be up to 606 bp long and in the majority of cases, it is longer than 250 bp. We obtained multiple heritable GT events, mostly heterozygous, but also biallelic GT events and some without T\\\\DNA integration. Thus, we were not only able to obtain CRISPR/Cas\\\\based heritable GT events in allotetraploid Nicotiana tabacum for the first time, but our results also indicate that ttLbCas12a might be a superior alternative for gene editing and GT in tobacco as well as in other crops.","output":"Efficient gene targeting in Nicotiana tabacum using CRISPR/SaCas9 and temperature tolerant LbCas12a"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The population in Mexico has high prevalence rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients in the countries most affected by the pandemic has been associated to chronic comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of NCDs in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico and analyze the increased risk due to comorbidities and risk factors on hospitalization, utilization of intensive care units and death. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 212,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health up to June 27, 2020. Odds ratios were performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Up to 47.40% of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were also reported with a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most frequent (20.12%). The report of at least one NCD significantly increased the risk of death with respect to patients without such diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease increased the risk of death the most (OR 2.31), followed by diabetes (OR 1.69), immunosuppression (OR 1.62), obesity (OR 1.42), hypertension (OR 1.24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.20). The comorbidities that most increased the risk of ICU and of intubation were diabetes, immunosuppression and obesity. CONCLUSION: NCD comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Given high NCD prevalence rates among the Mexican population, the pandemic poses a special threat to the health system and to society. Special prevention measures need to be strengthened for persons with NCD diagnoses in the short-term. In the mid-term, disease control strategies need to be improved to protect these patients against COVID-19 severity.","output":"Increased Risk of Hospitalization and Death in Patients with COVID-19 and Pre-existing Noncommunicable Diseases and Modifiable Risk Factors in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Children represent a small fraction of confirmed COVID-19 cases, with a low case fatality rate (CFR) In this paper, we lay out an evidence-based policy for reopening schools Methods: We gathered age-specific COVID-19 case counts and identified mortality data for 14 countries Dose-response meta-analysis was used to examine the relationship of the incremental case fatality rate (CFR) to age In addition, an evidence-to-decision framework (EtD) was used to correlate the dose-response data with other epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in childhood Results: In the dose-response analysis, we found that there was an almost negligible fatality below age 18 CFR rose little between ages 5 to 50 years The confidence intervals were narrow, suggesting relative homogeneity across countries Further data suggested decreased childhood transmission from respiratory droplets and a low viral load among children Conclusions: Opening up schools and kindergartens is unlikely to impact COVID-19 case or mortality rates in both the child and adult populations We outline a robust plan for schools that recommends that general principles not be micromanaged, with authority left to schools and monitored by public health authorities ? 2021, Paris Scholar Publishing All rights reserved","output":"An evidence base for school health policy during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) to neutralizing antibodies has largely been studied in the context of key receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations, including E484K and N501Y.

Hence, we elaborated on the relationship between ?-catenin expression and BC through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. As of March 2020, EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Science Direct/Elsevier, MEDLINE and CNKI were used for systematic literature retrieval to investigate the correlation between ?-catenin expression and BC. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager and Stata software. Fourteen studies were included, including 865 BC tissues and 106 controls. Combined ORs were identified with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) in a random- or fixed-effects model. We illustrated that there was a significant correlation between ?-catenin and BC, that there was abnormally high expression of ?-catenin in BC tissues compared with normal bladder tissues (P<0.05), and that the combined OR was 14.69[5.73, 37.65]. Furthermore, the aberrant expression rates of ?-catenin in high-grade and invasive bladder neoplasm tissues were greater than those in low-grade and non-muscle-invasive bladder tissues (P<0.05), and the combined ORs were 0.31[0.23, 0.43] and 0.21[0.15, 0.29].

ACE2 and other genes utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter human cells have been shown to express in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. However, their expression pattern in different subtypes has not been investigated. Hence, in the current study, we have analyzed the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN in 649 HNSCC patients from two independent cohorts. Our analysis showed significantly lower expression of TMPRSS2 while significantly increased expression of ACE2 and FURIN in HPV-negative HNSCC. Comparison of expression of these genes in the three subtypes of HNSCC patients (basal, classical and inflamed/mesenchymal) showed no significant difference in the expression of ACE2 among the three subtypes; however, the basal subtype showed significantly reduced expression of TMPRSS2 but significantly increased expression of FURIN. Comparison of expression of these genes between the HPV-negative patients of basal subtype vs all others confirmed significantly lower expression of TMPRSS2 in HPV-negative patients of basal subtype as compared to all others. Our study shows that the different subtypes of HNSCC patients have different expression patterns of genes utilized by the SARS-CoV-2 to enter human cells, and hence, their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 may also be different. As the expression of TMPRSS2 is significantly lower in the HNSCC patients of the basal subtype, we predict that these patients would be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than the patients of other subtypes.

The study aim was to identify significant prognostic factors and develop a predictive nomogram for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have undergone radiofrequency ablation. We also developed the formula to predict the probability of 3- and 5-year overall survival based on clinical variables. Methods We retrospectively studied 96 consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone radiofrequency ablation as a first-line treatment. Independent and significant factors affecting the overall survival were selected using a Cox proportional hazards model, and a prognostic nomogram was developed based on these factors. The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was determined by Harrell's concordance index and compared with the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score and Japan Integrated Staging score. Results A multivariate analysis revealed that age, indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate, and log (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) level were independent and significant factors influencing the overall survival. The nomogram was based on these three factors. The mean concordance index of the nomogram was 0.740.08, which was significantly better than that of conventional staging systems using the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score (0.540.03) and Japan Integrated Staging score (0.590.07). Conclusion This study suggested that the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate and age at radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) are good predictors of the prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after radiofrequency ablation.

We aimed to estimate COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) against severe disease and death in the Greek population, for all vaccines in use. Methods: Nationwide active surveillance and vaccination registry data during January-December 2021 were used to estimate VE via quasi-Poisson regression, as one minus the Incidence Rate Ratio, adjusted for age and calendar time. Interaction terms were included to assess VE by age group, against the 'delta' SARS-CoV-2 variant and waning of VE over time. Results: Two doses of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccines offered very high (>90%) VE against both intubation and death across all age groups, similar against both 'delta' and previous variants, with one-dose Ad26.COV2.S slightly lower. There was some waning over time but VE remained >80% at six months, and three doses increased VE again to near 100%. Vaccination prevented an estimated 19,691 COVID-19 deaths (95% CI: 18,890-20,788) over the study period. Conclusions: All approved vaccines were very highly effective in preventing COVID-19 severe disease and death. Every effort should be made to vaccinate the population with at least two doses, in order to reduce the mortality and morbidity impact of the pandemic.","output":"Comparative effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against death and severe disease in an ongoing nationwide mass vaccination campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human migration patterns influence the redistribution of population characteristics over the geography and since such distributions are closely related to social and economic outcomes, investigating the structure and dynamics of internal migration plays a crucial role in understanding and designing policies for such systems.

We identify a set of classical migration laws and examine them via various methods for signed network analysis, ego network analysis, representation learning, temporal stability analysis, community detection, and network visualization. The findings show that, in line with the classical migration laws, most migration links are geographically bounded with several exceptions involving cities with large economic activity, major migration flows are countered with migration flows in the opposite direction, there are well-defined migration routes, and the migration system is generally stable over the investigated period. Apart from these general results, we also provide unique and specific insights into Turkey.

The numbers of registrations are now raising inordinately. It is challenging to understand which research areas are explored in this massive pool of clinical studies. If such information can be compiled, then it is easy to explore new research studies for possible contributions in COVID-19 research. METHODS In the present work, a text-mining technique of artificial intelligence is utilized to map the research domains explored through the clinical trials of COVID-19. With the help of open-source and graphical user interface-based tool, 3007 clinical trials are analyzed here. The dataset is acquired from the international clinical trial registry platform of WHO. With the help of hierarchical cluster analysis, the clinical trials were grouped according to their common research studies. These clusters are analyzed manually using their word clouds for understanding the scientific area of a particular cluster. The scientific fields of clinical studies are comprehensively reviewed and discussed based on this analysis. RESULTS More than three-thousand clinical trial are grouped in 212 clusters by hierarchical cluster analysis. Manual intervention of these clusters using their individual word-cloud, helped to identify various scientific areas which are explored in COVID19 related clinical studies. CONCLUSION The text-mining is an easy and fastest way to explore many registered clinical trials. In our study, thirteen major clusters or research areas were identified in which the majority of clinical trials were registered. Many other uncategorized clinical studies were also identified as 'miscellaneousstudies'.

A wider definition considers any arthritis that occurs after a mucosal surface infection as ReA. There is limited consensus regarding a working definition, status of HLA-B27, or even classification criteria for ReA. This may also contribute to a lack of systemic studies or clinical trials for ReA, thereby reducing further treatment recommendations to expert opinions only. The emergence of post-COVID-19 ReA has brought the focus back on this enigmatic entity. Post-COVID-19 ReA can present at extremes of age, appears to affect both sexes equally and can have different presentations. Some present with small joint arthritis, others with SpA phenotype-either with peripheral or axial involvement, while a few have only tenosynovitis or dactylitis. The emergence of post-vaccination inflammatory arthritis hints at similar pathophysiology involved. There needs to be a global consensus on whether or not to include all such conditions under the umbrella of ReA. Doing so will enable studies on uniform groups on how infections precipitate arthritis and what predicts chronicity.

We sought to develop a research agenda to understand the short- and long-term mechanisms and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on childrens healthy development, with the goal of devising and ultimately testing interventions to respond to urgent needs and prepare for future pandemics. DESCRIPTION: The Life Course Intervention Research Network facilitated a series of virtual meetings that included members of 10 Maternal and Child Health (MCH) research programs, their research and implementation partners, as well as family and community representatives, to develop an MCH COVID-19 Research Agenda. Stakeholders from academia, clinical practice, nonprofit organizations, and family advocates participated in four meetings, with 30C35 participants at each meeting. ASSESSMENT: Investigating the impacts of COVID-19 on childrens mental health and ways to address them emerged as the highest research priority, followed by studying resilience at individual and community levels; identifying and mitigating the disparate negative effects of the pandemic on children and families of color, prioritizing community-based research partnerships, and strengthening local, state and national measurement systems to monitor childrens well-being during a national crisis. CONCLUSION: Enacting this research agenda will require engaging the community, especially youth, as equal partners in research co-design processes; centering anti-racist perspectives; adopting a strengths-based approach; and integrating young researchers who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC).

(2) To provide a treatment algorithm for care of COVID-19 positive/suspected hip fractures patients that accounts for their increased risk of morbidity and mortality. SETTING: One academic medical center including 4 Level 1 trauma centers, 1 university-based tertiary care referral hospital, and 1 orthopaedic specialty hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One thousand two hundred seventy-eight patients treated for hip fractures between October 2014 and April 2020, including 136 patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic between February 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020. INTERVENTION: The Score for Trauma Triage in the Geriatric and Middle-Aged (ORIGINAL) (STTGMA(ORIGINAL)) score was modified by adding COVID-19 virus as a risk factor for mortality to create the STTGMA(COVID) score. Patients were stratified into quartiles to demonstrate differences in risk distribution between the scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Inpatient and 30-day mortality, major, and minor complications. RESULTS: Both STTGMA score and COVID-19 positive/suspected status are independent predictors of inpatient mortality, confirming their use in risk assessment models for geriatric hip fracture patients. Compared with STTGMA(ORIGINAL,) where COVID-19 patients are haphazardly distributed among the risk groups and COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities comprise 50% deaths in the minimal-risk and low-risk cohorts, the STTGMA(COVID) tool is able to triage 100% of COVID-19 patients and 100% of COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities into the highest risk quartile, where it was demonstrated that these patients have a 55% rate of pneumonia, a 35% rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a 22% rate of inpatient mortality, and a 35% rate of 30 days mortality. COVID-19 patients who are symptomatic on presentation to the emergency department and undergo surgical fixation have a 30% inpatient mortality rate compared with 12.5% for patients who are initially asymptomatic but later develop symptoms. CONCLUSION: The STTGMA tool can be modified for specific disease processes, in this case to account for the COVID-19 virus and provide a robust risk stratification tool that accounts for a heretofore unknown risk factor. COVID-19 positive/suspected status portends a poor outcome in this susceptible trauma population and should be included in risk assessment models. These patients should be considered a high risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 symptoms on presentation should have surgery deferred until symptoms improve or resolve and should be reassessed for surgical treatment versus definitive nonoperative treatment with palliative care and/or hospice care.

However, this process is costly and time consuming. Therefore, there is a need for faster, reliable and economical methods. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant/oxidant levels of patients were estimated by Expert-models using biomarkers, which are effective in the diagnosis/prognosis of COVID-19 disease. For this purpose, Expert-models were trained and created between the white-blood-cell-count (WBC), lymphocyte-count (LYM), C-reactive-protein (CRP), D-dimer, Ferritin values of 35 patients with COVID-19 and antioxidant/oxidant parameter values of the same patients. Error criteria and R(2) ratio were taken into account for the performance of the models. The validity of the all models was checked by the Box-Jenkis-method. RESULTS: Antioxidant/Oxidant levels were estimated with 95% confidence-coefficient using the values of WBC, LYM, CRP, D-dimer, Ferritin of different 500 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with the trained models. The error rate of all models was low and the coefficients of determination were sufficient. In the first data set, there was no significant difference between measured antioxidant/oxidant levels and predicted antioxidant/oxidant levels. This result showed that the models are accurate and reliable. In determining antioxidant/oxidant levels, LYM and Ferritin biomarkers had the most effect on models, while WBC and CRP biomarkers had the least effect. The antioxidant/oxidant parameter estimated with the highest accuracy was Native-Thiol divided by Total-Thiol.

Published analyses from a 4-wave panel survey conducted with U.S. adults (N = 166) during the pandemic revealed that decreased face-to-face interactions and increased mediated interactions with friends predicted PSR growth (Bond, 2021). This study concluded that pandemic-induced reliance on screens to engage with real-life friends may have blurred the cognitive distinctions between real-life friends and liked media personae, thereby strengthening PSRs. The present study aimed to further investigate this line of reasoning by incorporating parasocial interaction (PSI) into a secondary analysis of the longitudinal data. Participant-reported liked media personae were coded for their PSI potential, defined as likelihood of engaging audiences in illusory interactions. Results suggest that PSRs experienced significant growth during the pandemic, particularly PSRs with media personae more likely to invoke PSI among those who also increased their mediated social interactions with real-life friends. These findings support and extend the conclusions of the initial analyses: PSRs may serve a compensation function during social distancing, and increased exposure to real-life friends through screen media may blur the lines between the social and parasocial, increasing the value of PSRs during social distancing.

To do so, we analyse the constructs of fitness for purpose and fitness for use across healthcare systems and in practice based on the literature, expert opinion and user experience. METHODS: A multiphase qualitative study was undertaken. Phases included a literature review, a first round of one-on-one interviews with a panel of academics and thought leaders in the field (n=16), and a second round of interviews with real-world users of performance indicators (n=16). Thematic analysis was conducted between phases in order to triangulate findings in a stepwise process. RESULTS: Common uses of healthcare performance indicators were differentiated within micro-meso-macro contexts of healthcare systems. Each purpose of use signals different decision-making tasks, and in effect information needs. An indicators fitness for use can be appraised by three clusters of considerations: methodological, contextual and managerial. Methodological considerations gauge an indicators perceived importance, engagement potential, interpretability, standardisation, feasibility of remedial actions, alignment to care models and sensitivity to change. Information infrastructure, system governance, workforce capacity and learning culture were found as enabling contextual considerations. Managerial considerations influencing an indicators use in practice were found to span the selection of indicators, data collection, analysis, display of results and delivery of information to decision-makers. CONCLUSION: The actionability of a healthcare performance indicator should be appraised by its alignment with the intended purpose of use beyond aggregate healthcare system levels, in combination with the extent to which methodological, contextual and managerial fitness for use considerations are met.

A descriptive analysis is conducted for the spread of the epidemic in the BRICS countries. Considering the nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics of COVID-19 data, a principle of decomposition-reconstruction(R)-prediction-integration is proposed. Correspondingly, this paper constructs an integrated deep learning prediction model of CEEMDAN-R-ILSTM-Elman. Specifically, the prediction model is integrated by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMDAN), improved long-term and short-term memory network (ILSTM), and Elman neural network. First, the data is decomposed by adopting CEEMDAN. Then, by calculating the permutation entropy and average period, the decomposed eigenmode component IMFs are reconstructed into four sequences of high, medium, low level, and trend term. Thus, ILSTM and Elman algorithms are used for component sequence prediction, whose results are integrated as the final results. The ILSTM is established based on the LSTM model and the improved beetle antennae search algorithm (IBAS). The ILSTM mainly considers that the prediction accuracy of LSTM model is vulnerable to the influence of parameter selection. The IBAS with adaptive step size is used to automatically optimize the super parameters of LSTM model and to improve the modeling efficiency and prediction accuracy. Experimental results indicate that compared with other benchmark models, CEEMDAN-R-ILSTM-Elman integrated model predicts the number of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 in BRICS countries with higher accuracy and lower error. Strict social policies have a greater impact on the infection rate and mortality rate of the epidemic.

Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system (RAS) element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the downregulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of COVID-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the COVID-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of COVID-19 strongly depends on the age of the patient. Age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially those of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone, may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs thorough clinical trials.","output":"Endocrine and metabolic aspects of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: La survenue de formes svres ou critiques de COVID-19, avec ncessit dune hospitalisation en ranimation, est associe  la prsence danticorps anti-Interfron de classe I dans environ 10 % des cas [1].

Verification and Validation (V & V) activities are the effective methods employed to achieve quality. Static and dynamic testing activities are performed during V & V. During static testing, the program code is not executed while in dynamic testing (Black Box and White Box), the execution of the program code is performed. Effective test cases are designed by both these methods. Tables are employed to represent test case documentation. The most beneficial representation - State table based testing, for generating test inputs is explained with the help of state graphs and state tables. This technique is mainly employed in embedded system software testing, real time applications and web application based software product testing where time constraints are a major criteria. Automatic generation of test cases will help to reduce time overhead in testing activities. Our study is to develop optimum test cases by a modified Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique in an automated method and it ensures maximum coverage. The prediction model used in this paper ensures better accuracy of the design of test inputs.

After signing consent, women 18-45 years were included. Internal consistency was calculated with Cronbach's alpha, external validity using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), factorial analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient for re-test. RESULTS: The sample included 178 women, mean age 31.04  5.9. We obtained internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha = 0.873 (95%CI, 0.842-0.899). Spearman's Rho coefficient was 0.207 (p= .013). All the elements were statistically significant for the polychoric correlation (p<.001). Reliability test-retest with intraclass correlation was 0.873.

Nevertheless, little is known about the microbiological characteristics of water in Lake Bunyonyi. This study was therefore undertaken to examine the spatial and temporal variations of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in relation to physicochemical parameters in Lake Bunyonyi. Result The FIB concentration was consistently measured during sampling months and correlated with each other showing the presumed human faecal pollution in the lake. The highest concentration values for E. coli (64.7  47.3 CFU/100 mL) and enterococci (24.6  32.4 CFU/100 mL were obtained in the station close to the Mugyera trading centre. On a temporal basis, the maximum values were recorded during the rainy season in October 2019 (70.7  56.5 CFU/100 mL for E. coli and 38.44  31.8 CFU/100 mL for enterococci. FIB did not differ significantly among the study stations (p > 0.05) but showed significant temporal variations among the months (p < 0.05) with concentrations being significantly high in wet season than dry season (U = 794, p < 0.0001 for E. coli; U = 993.5, p = 0.008 for enterococci). Spearmans rank correlation revealed that FIB concentrations were significantly positively correlated with turbidity and DO concentration levels (p < 0.05). Approximately 97.2% of the water samples had E. coli and enterococci concentrations levels below USEPA threshold for recreational waters. Likewise, 98.1 and 90.7% of samples recorded E. coli and enterococci counts exceeding the UNBS, APHA, WHO and EU threshold values for drinking water. Conclusion The FIB counts show that the Lake Bunyonyi water is bacteriologically unsuitable for drinking unless it is treated since the FIB pose health risks to consumers.

Lifting confinement restriction and resuming to normality depends greatly on COVID-19 immunity screening. Detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 by serological methods is important to diagnose a current or resolved infection. In this study, we applied a rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibody test and performed serology assessment of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. In PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (n=45), the total antibody detection rate is 92% in hospitalized patients and 79% in non-hospitalized patients. We also studied antibody response in relation to time after symptom onset and disease severity, and observed an increase in antibody reactivity and distinct distribution patterns of IgM and IgG following disease progression. The total IgM and IgG detection is 63% in patients with < 2 weeks from disease onset; 85% in non-hospitalized patients with > 2 weeks disease duration; and 91% in hospitalized patients with > 2 weeks disease duration. We also compared different blood sample types and suggest a potentially higher sensitivity by serum/plasma comparing with whole blood measurement. To study the specificity of the test, we used 69 sera/plasma samples collected between 2016-2018 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and obtained a test specificity of 97%. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive validation of the rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG serology test, and mapped antibody detection patterns in association with disease progress and hospitalization. Our study supports that the rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG test may be applied to assess the COVID-19 status both at the individual and at a population level.","output":"Serology assessment of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 by rapid IgM/IgG antibody test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the experiences of the educator as a key actor in entrepreneurship education.

Employing an interpretative phenomenological approach with ten UK-based higher education entrepreneurship education educators, this article sheds light on their experiences. The article concludes by proposing a conceptual model of the essence of entrepreneurship education educators experiences which identifies shared values, multiple identities and innovative practices. It finds something personal and inherently good about entrepreneurship education, beyond the knowledge of entrepreneurship, which attracts certain educators. These educators are found to be entrepreneurial with a need for change, distinctiveness and action which at times can lead to marginalisation from the traditional educational establishment.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment option for DME, although the injections are costly and require frequent visits which increases the risk for unintended treatment lapses. The aim of this study is to characterize the effects of an unintended treatment lapse in patients with DME undergoing anti-VEGF therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative case series. METHODS: This retrospective chart review compared patients seen in a multicenter institutional practice with DME exhibiting an un-intended minimum three-month lapse in anti-VEGF treatment, with a control group of DME patients receiving regular anti-VEGF treatment without lapses. The primary outcome was difference in central subfield thickness (CST) between the control group and the treatment lapse group at 6 months following treatment lapse. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were evaluated, 82 patients in the treatment lapse group and 82 patients in the control group. The average age was 65 years, and the average lapse in treatment was 6.2  3.5 months (range 3-24 months). Comparison of data between the lapse and control groups revealed no significant differences in CST respectively [(359.9108.3 m), (335.494.6 M)], p=0.066 or in visual acuity (VA) respectively [(66.514.3), (68.914.5)], p=0.136. Limitations included a relatively small sample size, retrospective nature, and only a single lapse being evaluated.

To this end, we augment the iso-flux tension propagation (IFTP) theory with electrostatics for a negatively charged biopolymer pulled through a nanopore embedded in a similarly charged anionic membrane. We show that in the realistic case of a single-stranded DNA molecule, dilute salt conditions characterized by weak charge screening, and a negatively charged membrane, the translocation dynamics is unexpectedly accelerated despite the presence of large repulsive electrostatic interactions between the polymer coil on the {\\\\it cis} side and the charged membrane. This is due to the rapid release of the electrostatic potential energy of the coil during translocation, leading to an effectively attractive force that assists end-driven translocation. The speedup results in non-monotonic polymer length and membrane charge dependence of the exponent $\\\\alpha$ characterizing the translocation time $\\\\tau \\\\propto N_0^\\\\alpha$ of the polymer with length $N_0$.

However, the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in ALV-J infection remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel chicken lncRNA derived from LTR5B of the ERV-L family (namely lnc-LTR5B), which is significantly downregulated in ALV-J infected cells. lnc-LTR5B was localized in the cytoplasm and was relatively high expressed in the chicken lung and liver. Notably, the replication of ALV-J was inhibited by the overexpression of lnc-LTR5B but enhanced when lnc-LTR5B expression was knocked down. We further confirmed that lnc-LTR5B could bind to the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), a master regulator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. Mechanistically, lnc-LTR5B serves as a competing endogenous RNA for BiP, restricting its physical availability. Upon ALV-J infection, the reduction of lnc-LTR5B released BiP, which facilitated its translocation to the cell surface. This is crucial for ALV-J entry as well as pro-survival signaling. In conclusion, we identified an endogenous retroviral LTR-activated lnc-LTR5B that is involved in regulating the cell surface translocation of BiP, and such regulatory machinery can be exploited by ALV-J to complete its life cycle and propagate.","output":"An Endogenous Retroviral LTR-Derived Long Noncoding RNA lnc-LTR5B Interacts With BiP to Modulate ALV-J Replication in Chicken Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with end-stage kidney disease are at increased risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Despite prompt treatment with three technically successful thrombectomies along with systemic intravenous heparin and two rounds of catheter-directed thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator, the fistula rapidly re-thrombosed each time and he required tunneled dialysis catheter placement. He subsequently required admission for hypoxemia from COVID-19 pneumonia and ultimately developed a catheter-related blood stream infection that likely contributed to his death.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess COVID-19's impact on health students in France on different levels: psychological, educational and social. METHODS: An online national cross-sectional study, from April 11 to May 30 2020, included sociodemographic, work conditions and numeric scales. RESULTS: 4411 students answered. Regarding the K6 scale, 39% of students had moderate distress, and 21% had a high level of distress. Risk factors of psychological distress included being a woman (p<0.001), being between 19 and 21 years old (p<0.001), living alone (p=0.008), and not having the ability to isolate (p<0.001). Students on the frontline had less psychological distress (57 vs 62 %, p= 0.003), better quality of sleep (34% vs 28% high quality, p<0.001) but a higher consumption of medical (8.5% vs 6.5%, p=0.044) and non-medical (18% vs 10%, p<0.001) psychotropic drugs.

Among different treatments proposed, exogenous surfactant showed conflicting results. Aim of this multicenter retrospective observational study was to evaluate whether poractant alfa use in pediatric ARDS might improve gas exchange in children less than 2 years old, according to a shared protocol. METHODS: The study was carried out in fourteen Italian PICUs after dissemination of a standardized protocol for surfactant administration within the Italian PICU network. The protocol provides the administration of surfactant (50 mg/kg) divided in two doses: the first dose is used as a bronchoalveolar lavage while the second as supplementation. Blood gas exchange variations before and after surfactant use were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children, age 0C24 months, affected by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome treated with exogenous porcine surfactant were enrolled. Data collection consisted of patient demographics, respiratory variables and arterial blood gas analysis. The most frequent reasons for PICU admission were acute respiratory failure, mainly bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and septic shock. Fifty-four children (78.3%) had severe ARDS (define by oxygen arterial pressure and inspired oxygen fraction ratio (P/F) < 100), 15 (21.7%) had moderate ARDS (100 < P/F < 200). PO(2), P/F, Oxygenation Index (OI) and pH showed a significant improvement after surfactant use with respect to baseline (p < 0.001 at each included time-point for each parameter). No significant difference in blood gas variations were observed among four different subgroups of diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, septic shock and others). Overall, 11 children died (15.9%) and among these, 10 (90.9%) had complex chronic conditions. Two children (18.2%) died while being treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Mortality for severe pARDS was 20.4%. CONCLUSION: The use of porcine Surfactant improves oxygenation, P/F ratio, OI and pH in a population of children with moderate or severe pARDS caused by multiple diseases. A shared protocol seems to be a good option to obtain the same criteria of enrollment among different PICUs and define a unique way of use and administration of the drug for future studies.","output":"A shared protocol for porcine surfactant use in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome: a feasibility study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The discovery of laser-induced graphene (LIG) from polymers in 2014 has aroused much attention in recent years.

An online, nationally representative sample of the adult population in the United Kingdom (N = 520) completed a previously validated measure of rational thinking style, as well as novel measures of rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists and compliance with mandated requirements. Intercorrelations between scores on all three measures were significant and positive. Mediation analysis indicated that rational thinking style and rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists, respectively, were directly associated with compliance, and that the mediated association was also significant.

Compared to diseases caused by earlier identified human CoVs, COVID-19 displays higher transmission competence with minimal severe pathogenesis, as is obvious from the unceasingly increasing numeral of confirmed cases. Older adults with diabetes, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, etc., are more likely to be infected with COVID-19, and COVID-19 disease affects older adults with underlying chronic conditions more than other age groups. Comorbidities are known to aggravate the course of COVID-19 and increase the risk of death associated with COVID-19. However, one factor that makes it difficult for older adults to fight infection is that they have a weaker immune system than other individuals. Another group that the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, could infect is children. However, they seem to be lesser sensitive to infections than adults, and COVID-19 symptoms are usually milder. There are currently no scientific data with a sufficient level of evidence regarding the treatments for COVID-19 infection in children. Therefore, COVID-19 for children's treatment recommendations should be evaluated according to adult studies and pediatric patients.

Unfortunately, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially variants of concern (VOCs), are less susceptible to neutralization by the convalescent and post-vaccination sera, raising concerns of increased disease transmissibility and severity. Recent data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels are a reliable correlate of vaccine-mediated protection. However, currently used BSL3-based virus micro-neutralization (MN) assays are more laborious, time-consuming, and expensive, underscoring the need for BSL2-based, cost-effective neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Clinical text data incorporates significant phenotypic medical entities (e.g., symptoms, diseases, and laboratory indexes), which could be used for profiling the clinical characteristics of patients in specific disease conditions (e.g., Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)). However, general BioNER approaches mostly rely on coarse-grained annotations of phenotypic entities in benchmark text dataset. Owing to the numerous negation expressions of phenotypic entities (e.g., no fever, no cough, and no hypertension) in clinical texts, this could not feed the subsequent data analysis process with well-prepared structured clinical data. In this paper, we developed Human-machine Cooperative Phenotypic Spectrum Annotation System (http://www.tcmai.org/login, HCPSAS) and constructed a fine-grained Chinese clinical corpus. Thereafter, we proposed a phenotypic named entity recognizer: Phenonizer, which utilized BERT to capture character-level global contextual representation, extracted local contextual features combined with bidirectional long short-term memory, and finally obtained the optimal label sequences through conditional random field. The results on COVID-19 dataset show that Phenonizer outperforms those methods based on Word2Vec with an F1-score of 0.896. By comparing character embeddings from different data, it is found that character embeddings trained by clinical corpora can improve F-score by 0.0103. In addition, we evaluated Phenonizer on two kinds of granular datasets and proved that fine-grained dataset can boost methods' F1-score slightly by about 0.005. Furthermore, the fine-grained dataset enables methods to distinguish between negated symptoms and presented symptoms. Finally, we tested the generalization performance of Phenonizer, achieving a superior F1-score of 0.8389.

A pat7 motif of 41-PGKK(N/S)KK has previously been identified in the N protein as the functional nuclear localization signal (NLS); however, the biological consequences of N protein nuclear localization are unknown. In the present study, the role of N protein nuclear localization during infection was investigated in pigs using an NLS-null mutant virus. When two lysines at 43 and 44 at the NLS locus were substituted to glycines, the modified NLS with 41-PGGGNKK restricted the N protein to the cytoplasm. This NLS-null mutation was introduced into a full-length infectious cDNA clone of PRRSV. Upon transfection of cells, the NLS-null full-length clone induced cytopathic effects and produced infectious progeny. The NLS-null virus grew to a titer 100-fold lower than that of wild-type virus. To examine the response to NLS-null PRRSV in the natural host, three groups of pigs, consisting of seven animals per group, were intranasally inoculated with wild-type, placebo, or NLS-null virus, and the animals were maintained for 4 weeks. The NLS-null-infected pigs had a significantly shorter mean duration of viremia than wild-type-infected pigs but developed significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibodies. Mutations occurred at the NLS locus in one pig during viremia, and four types of mutations were identified: 41-PGRGNKK, 41-PGGRNKK, and 41-PGRRNKK, and 41-PGKKSKK. Both wild-type and NLS-null viruses persisted in the tonsils for at least 4 weeks, and the NLS-null virus persisting in the tonsils was found to be mutated to either 41-PGRGNKK or 41-PGGRNKK in all pigs. No other mutation was found in the N gene. All types of reversions which occurred during viremia and persistence were able to translocate the mutated N proteins to the nucleus, indicating a strong selection pressure for reversion at the NLS locus of the N protein in vivo. Reversions from NLS-null to functional NLS in the tonsils suggest a possible correlation of viral persistence with N protein nuclear localization. These results show that N protein nuclear localization is non-essential for PRRSV multiplication but may play an important role in viral attenuation and in pathogenesis in vivo.","output":"Mutations within the nuclear localization signal of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nucleocapsid protein attenuate virus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To limit the transmission of COVID-19, nationwide lockdown was imposed in France between March, 17th and May 10th, 2020.

A convenience sample of 938 French adults completed online questionnaires on the Qualtrics platform at the end of April 2020. Participants were retrospectively asked about their food choice motives and food consumption during the month before and in the first month of the lockdown. The importance of nine food choice motives was assessed: health, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, ethical concern, weight control, mood, familiarity, and price, scoring from 1 to 4. Food intakes were recorded using a food frequency questionnaire including 110 foods, 12 non-alcoholic beverages and 4 alcoholic beverages. Adherence to the French dietary recommendations before and during the lockdown was estimated using the simplified PNNS-GS2, scoring from -17 to 11.5. The nutritional quality of diet was lower during the lockdown compared to before (-0.32, SD 2.28, p < 0.001). Food choice motives significantly changed and an increase in the importance of weight control was associated with increased nutritional quality (? = 0.89, p < 0.001, partial ?2 = 0.032), whereas an increase in the importance of mood was associated with decreased nutritional quality (? = -0.43, p = 0.021, partial ?2 = 0.006). The lockdown period in France was related to a decrease in nutritional quality of diet on average, which could be partly explained by changes in food choice motives. The lockdown was indeed related to modification of food choice motives, notably with an increase of mood as a food choice motive for 48% of the participants, but also with an increase of health (26%), ethical concern (21%) and natural content (19%) suggesting a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable food choices in some participants.","output":"Food choice motives and the nutritional quality of diet during the COVID-19 lockdown in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The specialty of Obstetrics and Gynaecology has been on the forefront of introducing simulation in post graduate education for the past two decades.

Patients presenting with complications from cosmetic tourism were included and their hospital notes were reviewed. RESULTS: Seven patients were identified in the COVID-19 cohort compared with four patients in the comparator. In the COVID-19 patient group, six underwent their procedure overseas. The final patient was operated on in the UK by a visiting surgeon. Cases consisted of two abdominoplasties, two breast augmentations, two gluteal augmentations, and the final patient had a hernia repair. The most common presenting complaint in the COVID-19 cohort was a post-operative wound infection (n=5), of which two had deeper associated collections, with two further wound dehiscences.

During CoV infection, numerous cytokines and chemokines are induced in vitro and in vivo. Human interleukin 8 and its mouse functional counterpart, CXCL2, are early-expressed chemokines. Here we show that SARS-CoV and MHV induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and Cxcl2 mRNA transcription during infection in vitro. Expression of the viral spike protein significantly induced ER stress and Cxcl2 mRNA upregulation, while expression of the other structural genes did not. Additional experiments with UV-inactivated virus, cell-cell fusion-blocking antibodies, and an MHV mutant with a defect in spike protein maturation demonstrated that spike-host interactions in the ER are responsible for the induction of ER stress and subsequent Cxcl2 mRNA transcription. Despite significant increases in levels of Cxcl2 mRNA and functional nucleus-to-cytoplasm RNA transport, no CXCL2 protein was released into the medium from MHV-infected cells. Yet Sendai virus-infected cells showed substantial Cxcl2 mRNA induction and a simultaneous increase in levels of secreted CXCL2 protein. Our results demonstrate that expression of CoV spike proteins induces ER stress, which could subsequently trigger innate immune responses. However, at that point in infection, translation of host mRNA is already severely reduced in infected cells, preventing the synthesis of CXCL2 and ER stress proteins despite their increased mRNA concentrations.","output":"The coronavirus spike protein induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and upregulation of intracellular chemokine mRNA concentrations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on tourism, and emotion projection is one way to understand the extent of destination image resiliency during the crisis.

However, the relevance of these investigations with respect to understanding MCAs' chemistry appears often vague. Here, we discuss how insights into the electronic structure obtained from negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) combined with theoretical calculations and collision-induced dissociation can provide a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic chemical reactivity of MCAs and their fragments. This is exemplified in our studies on polyhedral closo-borate dianions [BnXn]2- (n = 6, 10, 11, 12; X = H, F-I, CN) and their fragment ions. For example, the rational design of closo-borate dianions with specific electronic properties is described, which leads to generating highly reactive fragments. Depending on the dianionic precursor, these fragments are tuned to either bind noble gases effectively or activate small molecules like CO and N2. The intrinsic electronic properties of closo-borate dianions are further compared to their electrochemistry in solutions, revealing solvent effects on the redox potentials. Neutral host molecules such as cyclodextrins are found to bind strongly to [BnXn]2-, and gas phase NIPES provides insights into the intrinsic host-guest interactions. Finally, outlooks including the direct NIPES of molecular fragment ions that cannot be generated in the condensed phase and their utilization in preparative mass spectrometry are discussed.","output":"Measuring Electronic Structure of Multiply Charged Anions to Understand Their Chemistry: A Case Study on Gaseous Polyhedral closo-Borate Dianions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A new illness could first come to the public attention over social media before it is medically defined, formally documented or systematically studied. One example is a phenomenon known as breast implant illness (BII) that has been extensively discussed on social media, though vaguely defined in medical literature. Objectives: The objective of this study is to construct a data analysis pipeline to understand emerging illness using social media data, and to apply the pipeline to understand key attributes of BII. Methods: We conducted a pipeline of social media data analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and topic modeling. We extracted mentions related to signs/symptoms, diseases/disorders and medical procedures using the Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) from social media data. We mapped the mentions to standard medical concepts. We summarized mapped concepts to topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Finally, we applied this pipeline to understand BII from several BII-dedicated social media sites. Results: Our pipeline identified topics related to toxicity, cancer and mental health issues that are highly associated with BII. Our pipeline also shows that cancers, autoimmune disorders and mental health problems are emerging concerns associated with breast implants based on social media discussions. The pipeline also identified mentions such as rupture, infection, pain and fatigue as common self-reported issues among the public, as well as toxicity from silicone implants. Conclusions: Our study could inspire future work studying the suggested symptoms and factors of BII.

METHODS We examined consecutive patients enrolled in the population-based Mayo Clinic Olmsted Study of Aging and then admitted to medical or surgical adult ICUs at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014 to determine one-year functional outcomes. RESULTS 831cases were included. Mean age was 84 years (IQR 79-88). 569 (68.5%) patients were alive one year after ICU admission. Of them, 546 patients had functional assessment at one year and 367 (67.2%) had good functional outcome. On multivariable analysis, poor one-year functional outcome (death or disability) was more common among women, older patients, and patients with baseline cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment or dementia), higher Carlson scores, and longer ICU stay (all P <.01). After excluding deceased patients, these associations remained unchanged. In addition, 120 (32.3%) of 372 patients who had post-ICU cognitive evaluation experienced cognitive decline after the ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS On a population-based cohort of older, predominantly elderly patients, approximately two-thirds of survivors maintained or regained good functional status 1 year after ICU hospitalization. However, older age, female sex, greater comorbidities, abnormal baseline cognition, and longer ICU stay were associated with poor functional recovery and cognitive decline was common.","output":"Functional outcome after critical illness in older patients: a population-based study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

We sought to investigate pulmonary hemodynamics and ventilation properties in patients with CARDS compared to patients with ARDS of pulmonary origin. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients treated in our ICU in 04/2020 and a comparison of the data to matched controls with ARDS due to respiratory infections treated in our ICU from 01/2014 to 08/2019 for whom pulmonary artery catheter data were available. RESULTS: CARDS patients (n = 10) had ventilation characteristics similar to those of ARDS (n = 10) patients. Nevertheless, mechanical power applied by ventilation was significantly higher in CARDS patients (23.4  8.9 J/min) than in ARDS (15.9  4.3 J/min; P < 0.05). COVID-19 patients had similar pulmonary artery pressure but significantly lower pulmonary vascular resistance, as cardiac output was higher in CARDS vs. ARDS patients (P < 0.05). Shunt fraction and dead space were similar in CARDS compared to ARDS (P > 0.05) and were correlated with hypoxemia in both groups. The arteriovenous pCO2 difference (a?pCO2) was elevated (CARDS 5.5  2.8 mmHg vs. ARDS 4.7  1.1 mmHg; P > 0.05), as was the P(v-a)CO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio (CARDS mean 2.2  1.5 vs. ARDS 1.7  0.8; P > 0.05).

In this study, the performance of four different ventilation systems (vertical laminar airflow ventilation (VLAF), horizontal laminar airflow ventilation (HLAF), differential vertical airflow ventilation (DVAF), and temperature-controlled airflow ventilation (TAF)) used in an OR was evaluated and compared based on the spatial BCP concentration. The airflow field in the OR was solved by the Renormalization Group (RNG) k- turbulence model, and the BCP phase was calculated by Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) and the discrete random walk (DRW) model. It was found that the TAF system was the most effective ventilation system among the four ventilation systems for ensuring air cleanliness in the operating area.

Researchers are therefore using bioinformatics sequence analysis tools, epitope-mapping tools, microarrays, and high-throughput immunology assays to discover the minimal essential components of the immunome. When these minimal components, or epitopes, are packaged with adjuvants in an appropriate delivery vehicle, the complete package comprises an epitope-based immunome-derived vaccine.

The inhibitor was identified through high-throughput screening of a compound library using a luciferase-expressing West Nile (WN) virus infection assay. The compound inhibited an epidemic strain of WN virus without detectable cytotoxicity (a 50% effective concentration of 28 microM and a compound concentration of >or=300 microM required to reduce 50% cell viability). Besides WN virus, the compound also inhibited other flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses), an alphavirus (Western equine encephalitis virus), a coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus), and a rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus). However, the compound did not suppress an orthomyxovirus (influenza virus) or a retrovirus (human immunodeficiency virus type 1). Mode-of-action analyses in WN virus showed that the compound did not inhibit viral entry or virion assembly but specifically suppressed viral RNA synthesis. To examine the mechanism of inhibition of dengue virus, we developed two replicon systems for dengue type 1 virus: (i) a stable cell line that harbored replicons containing a luciferase reporter and a neomycin phosphotransferase selection marker and (ii) a luciferase-expressing replicon that could differentiate between viral translation and RNA replication. Analyses of the compound in the dengue type 1 virus replicon systems showed that it weakly suppressed viral translation but significantly inhibited viral RNA synthesis.

The failure coincided with emerging stress at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient suffered from childhood on from ruminative thinking and depressive mood, which was treated in several settings during his life. He started to use alcohol to control his depression, but developed an alcohol addiction. This was successfully treated and the patient remained abstinent for more than 25 years afterwards. About 7 years ago, he started to use Kratom 3C4 times daily on a regular, but constant rate. Kratom use worked efficiently as a self-management of his depression with no escalation of dosing. It was also very effective in reducing Morbus Menire symptoms of tinnitus and sudden hearing loss, which eventually allowed regular performance as a caregiver in a demanding job on shift-work. During recently increased stress load in the work environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, the established Kratom doses failed to control hyperarousal and mental nervousness. The patient was treatment seeking and subsequently detoxified from Kratom. Anxiety- and depression management was shifted to treatment attempts with Lorazepam, Venlafaxine, Opipramol, Mirtazapine and psychotherapy. CONCLUSION: Kratom instrumentalization for self-management of depression and anxiety may effectively work without causing escalation of drug use and addiction, but may be limited by a temporary increase in psychological stress load and a relapse into major depression and generalized anxiety disorder.","output":"Kratom use for depression/anxiety self-management: challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic C A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to study the problem of sustainable development financing in the conditions of the budget deficit and investment collapse during the 2020 crisis and to determine the perspectives of solving this problem.

Forecasts of change of the indicators values, which characterize the opportunities for sustainable development financing, are developed. The established regression dependence helps to determine the consequences for sustainable development. Findings: A forecast of financing and sustainable development amid the crisis of 2020 is compiled. The budget deficit will be more vivid (surplus budget will decrease by 220.61%, and government debt will grow by 85.42%); the investment will shrink by 41.96%.

Instead, a point-of-need device that can be used at home or in doctors offices for COVID-19 serology testing must be developed and is one of four target products prioritized by the World Health Organization. Lateral flow assays are common and easy to use, but lack the sensitivity needed to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in clinical samples. This work describes a disposable ELISA device that is as simple to use as a lateral flow assay, but as sensitive as a well-plate ELISA. The device utilizes capillary-driven flow channels made of transparency films and double-sided adhesive combined with paper pumps to drive flow. The geometry of the channels and storage pads enables automated sequential washing and reagent addition steps with two simple end-user steps. An enzyme label is used to produce a colorimetric signal instead of a nanoparticle label in order to amplify signal and increase sensitivity, while the integrated washing steps decrease false positives and increase reproducibility. Naked-eye detection can be used for qualitative results or a smartphone camera for quantitative analysis. The device can detect antibodies at 2.8 ng/mL from whole blood, which was very close the concentration of detectable target in a well-plate ELISA (1.2 ng/mL).

Pairwise comparisons were performed between: (i) those with or without significant bacterial growth from cultures, and (ii) those who survived or died in hospital. RESULTS: CRP concentrations were higher over time in COVID-19 patients with positive microbiology (day 9: 236 vs 123 mg/L, p < 0.0001) and in those who died (day 8: 226 vs 152 mg/L, p < 0.0001) but only after day 7 of COVID-related symptom onset. Failure for CRP to reduce in the first week of hospital admission was associated with significantly higher odds of death.

Here we report deep gamma-ray observations with arcminute angular resolution of the Galactic Centre regions, which show the expected tracer of the presence of PeV particles within the central 10~parsec of the Galaxy. We argue that the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is linked to this PeVatron. Sagittarius A* went through active phases in the past, as demonstrated by X-ray outbursts and an outflow from the Galactic Centre. Although its current rate of particle acceleration is not sufficient to provide a substantial contribution to Galactic cosmic rays, Sagittarius A* could have plausibly been more active over the last $\\\\gtrsim 10^{6-7}$ years, and therefore should be considered as a viable alternative to supernova remnants as a source of PeV Galactic cosmic rays.","output":"Acceleration of petaelectronvolt protons in the Galactic Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this review was to identify the characteristics of Indigenous healing strategies in Canada and culturally relevant approaches within Indigenous contexts. INTRODUCTION In responding to Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action, there is increasing interest in Indigenous healing strategies across clinical, policy, and community sectors. The high relevance of Indigenous healing has also encouraged exploration of new approaches to research that are responsive to, and inclusive of, Indigenous contexts. To date, there is no clear understanding of what characterizes Indigenous healing strategies in Canada. INCLUSION CRITERIA This review considered healing strategies for First Nations, Inuit, and Mtis in Canada. Strategies examined included those related to health services and programs, policies and guidelines, models and frameworks, and Indigenous narratives and expert opinion in any service setting. METHODS This review employed the JBI approach to scoping reviews. Searches were performed in CINAHL Full Text, Sociological Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Academic Search Premier in December 2018. Searches for gray literature were conducted in iPortal, Canadian Electronic Library, and a list of Canadian government and Indigenous organization websites in February 2019. This review was limited to publications from 2008. Non-English articles and theses and dissertations were excluded. RESULTS Among the 59 articles included in this review, 41 were journal articles and 28 were published within the last five years (i.e., 2014 and onward). The healing strategies were most frequently implemented in Ontario (n = 13), British Columbia (n = 8) and Manitoba (n = 5). The majority of strategies were utilized in the health setting (n = 37), which included mainstream treatment modalities as well as community-based healing initiatives. Services and programs (n = 24) were the predominant type of healing strategies, followed by models and frameworks (n = 9); policies and guidelines (n = 8); Indigenous narratives and expert opinion (n = 7); and others (n = 11). The most frequent guiding principles were identified as Honoring Cultures and Traditions (n = 14), Medicine Wheel (n = 12), and Strength-Based/Empowerment (n = 12). The most widely used main components were Artistic Expression (n = 16), Ceremonies (n = 15), and Games and Exercises (n = 12). As for human resources, Community Members (n = 19) were most frequently engaged, followed by Local Agencies (n = 12), and Knowledge Keepers (n = 12). Eight culturally relevant approaches were identified from 29 primary research studies, with the most popular being Consultation/Participatory Research (n = 20) and Indigenous Protocols (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS The findings of this review collectively support a decolonizing approach that upholds Indigenous knowledge, respects Indigenous rights to self-determination, and recognizes Indigenous resilience and agency. More research is needed with a focus on Inuit or Mtis healing, and innovative knowledge synthesis methods inclusive of diverse Indigenous ways of knowing.","output":"Characteristics of Indigenous healing strategies in Canada: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Many parents of children with chronic conditions and developmental disabilities experience high rates of burnout and psychological distress. The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of two differently delivered interventions based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on symptoms of burnout, depression, quality of life, psychological flexibility, and mindfulness skills. METHOD: A total of 110 parents of children aged 0.8 to 17 years with chronic conditions and developmental disabilities participated in a randomized controlled trial lasting 13 weeks with two intervention groups: (1) an iACT intervention, including three psychologist-led video conferencing sessions, and (2) a self-help ACT, which received self-help material: an ACT-based booklet with the possibility of using ACT-based online exercises. RESULTS: For the main outcome measure burnout, a similar decrease was found in both groups. The supported iACT intervention produced significantly larger improvements in depressive symptoms (d = 0.49), psychological flexibility (d = 0.64), and mindfulness (d = 0.55) compared to the self-help ACT intervention. For health-related quality of life, only the dimension of role limitations caused by emotional problems showed a significant difference in favor of the supported iACT (d = 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the iACT intervention including three video conferencing sessions with a psychologist produced broader improvements in parents' psychological well-being than the self-help ACT. Overall, Internet-delivered interventions and video conferencing technology may offer a feasible alternative to psychological support and self-care for parents of children with chronic conditions. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of the current delivery models.","output":"Supporting parents of children with chronic conditions: A randomized controlled trial of web-based and self-help ACT interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growth performance, liver and spleen weight, plasma, and ceca digesta metabolites and incidences of diarrhea were investigated in growing pigs fed spent biomass of Pichia kudriavzevii. Ninety six barrows (~25 kg, 4 pigs/pen) were fed 1 of 4 experimental diets (n = 6) for 7 weeks. The diets were control, corn-, and soybean meal-based diet or control plus 2.5%, 3.75%, or 5.0% P. kudriavzevii. Diets were formulated to be isocaloric and iso nitrogenous. Feed intake and body weight (BW) were recorded weekly for calculation of average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F). Fecal scores were taken 3 d/wk to assess incidence and severity of diarrhea. One pig/pen close to pen average was bled for plasma metabolites on days 7 and 49 and subsequently euthanized for spleen and liver weight, ileal and cecum digesta samples for concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). The concentration of crude protein, crude fat, and non-fiber carbohydrates in P. kudriavzevii biomass was 36.4%, 9.6%, and 50.8% DM, respectively. Inclusion of P. kudriavzevii tended (P = 0.06) to linearly reduce ADG from days 8 through 49 resulting in a trend (P = 0.06) for linear reduction in the final BW. The final BW was 79.0, 79.2, 76.8, and 75.5 kg for the 0%, 2.5%, 3.75%, and 5.0% P. kudriavzevii, respectively. Diets had no effect (P > 0.10) on ADFI, G:F, spleen, and liver weight throughout the entire experiment. On day 7, there was cubic (P = 0.03) decrease and quadratic (P = 0.02) increase in plasma concentration of creatinine and urea N, respectively. However, there were no (P > 0.10) diet effects on plasma metabolites on day 49. There was a tendency (P = 0.08) for linear increase in cecum digesta concentration of acetic acid. There were no diet effects (P > 0.10) on fecal score in the first 4 wk of feeding. In conclusion, feeding P. kudriavzevii yeast tended to depress growth and stimulate cecum fermentation at higher dose and had no detrimental effects on organ weights or plasma metabolites in growing pigs.","output":"Growth performance, organ weight, fecal scores, plasma, and ceca digesta microbial metabolites in growing pigs fed spent biomass of Pichia kudriavzevii."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A DEWATS (decentralized wastewater treatment system) is an alternative for expanding sanitation. In Brazil, DEWATS is acknowledged by law and is part of the National Sanitation Plan strategy for achieving the treatment of 85.6% of all the generated wastewater by 2033, improving the current treatment index of 49%. This review's aim is to identify DEWATS studies in Brazil and to verify their potential for narrowing the national wastewater treatment deficit. Hence, aspects such as cost, maintenance, and efficiency were assessed. The archival research method (ARM) was used to identify papers published in the last 20 years through the scientific databases of Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science. Data regarding the general characteristics of each study were collected and compared to Brazilian environmental regulation and sanitation status. The results showed the evaluation of different technologies such as DEWATS, highlighting their flexibility and potential use in 79% of Brazilian counties. However, although 81% of the studies conducted performance analysis, none covered the main parameters required by Brazilian law. Although legal gaps for DEWATS improvement and consolidation have been identified and the interest in studying DEWATS has been increasing in the last five years, many barriers to their widespread use remain.","output":"Systematic review of the last 20 years of research on decentralized domestic wastewater treatment in Brazil: state of the art and potentials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Minicells, small cells lacking a chromosome, produced by bacteria with mutated min genes, which control cell division septum placement, have many potential uses. Minicells have contributed to basic bacterial physiology studies and can enable new biotechnological applications, including drug delivery and vaccines. Genome-reduced (GR) bacteria are another informative area of investigation. Investigators identified that with even almost 30% of the E. coli genome deleted, the bacteria still live. In biotechnology and synthetic biology, GR bacteria offer certain advantages. With GR bacteria, more recombinant genes can be placed into GR chromosomes and fewer cell resources are devoted to purposes apart from biotechnological goals. Here, we show that these two technologies can be combined: min mutants can be made in GR E. coli. The minCminD mutant GR E. coli produce minicells that concentrate engineered recombinant proteins within these spherical delivery systems. We expressed recombinant GFP protein in the cytoplasm of GR bacteria and showed that it is concentrated within the minicells. We also expressed proteins on the surfaces of minicells made from GR bacteria using a recombinant Gram-negative AIDA-I autotransporter expression cassette. As some autotransporters, like AIDA-I, are concentrated at the bacterial poles, where minicells bud, and because the surface-to-volume ratio of the small minicells is higher than bacteria, recombinant proteins expressed on surfaces of the GR bacteria are concentrated on the minicells. Minicells made from GR bacteria can enable useful biotechnological innovations, such as drug delivery vehicles and vaccine immunogens.","output":"Minicells from Highly Genome Reduced Escherichia coli: Cytoplasmic and Surface Expression of Recombinant Proteins and Incorporation in the Minicells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Precise clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated genetic and epigenetic manipulation of the immune response has become a promising immunotherapeutic approach toward combating tumorigenesis and tumor progression.

To date, the ex vivo re-engineering of immune cells directed to inhibit the expression of immune checkpoints or to express synthetic immune receptors (chimeric antigen receptor therapy) has shown success in some settings, such as in the treatment of melanoma, lymphoma, liver, and lung cancer.

Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the emotional significance of the faces contributes to efficient searches for emotional faces due to the possible confounding effects of visual saliency. We addressed this issue by excluding the influence of visual factors and examined older adults' ability to detect faces with emotional meaning. METHOD We used an associative learning procedure in which neutral faces were paired with monetary reward or punishment, such that the neutral faces acquired positive or negative emotional value. Older participants completed the associative learning task and then engaged in a visual search task, in which previously learned neutral faces were presented as discrepant faces among newly presented neutral distractor faces. Data of young adults from a previous study that used identical experimental procedures were also analyzed. RESULTS Older participants exhibited lower learning ability than young participants. However, older adults who were successful at learning were able to detect neutral faces associated with reward or punishment more rapidly than those without monetary outcomes, similar to the pattern observed for young adults. DISCUSSION The results suggest that acquired emotional value promotes the detection of value-associated neutral faces among older adults who succeed at learning. It is therefore possible that the ability to detect faces that evoke emotions is preserved in older adults.","output":"Rapid detection of neutral faces associated with emotional value among older adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 7th March 2020, the ministry of health, Govt of India, said that the number of highly contagious Coronavirus disease cases in India had risen to 34 In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) had described the outbreak of febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology from Wuhan in China Now named Covid-19, it has now spread to more than 90 countries As on 7th March 2020, there were 101,923 confirmed cases and 3486 deaths from 94 countries, areas and territories WHO has declared the outbreak as Public Health Emergency of International Concern?

The Krebs Von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) as a sensitive marker reflects the degree of fibrosis and this study will focus on analyzing the evaluative efficacy and predictive role of KL-6 in COVID-19 secondary pulmonary fibrosis. The study lasted more than three months and included total 289 COVID-19 patients who were divided into moderate (n=226) and severe groups (n=63) according to the severity of illness. Clinical information such as inflammation indicators, radiological results and lung function tests were collected. The time points of nucleic acid test were also recorded. Furthermore, based on Chest radiology detection, it was identified that 80 (27.7%) patients developed reversible pulmonary fibrosis and 34 (11.8%) patients developed irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows that KL-6 could diagnose the severity of COVID-19 (AUC=0.862) and predict the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis (AUC = 0.741) and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis (AUC=0.872). Importantly, the cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that KL-6 rises earlier than the development of lung radiology fibrosis, thus also illuminating the predictive function of KL-6. We set specific values (505U/mL and 674U/mL) for KL-6 in order to assess the risk of pulmonary fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The survival curves for days in hospital show that the higher the KL-6 levels, the longer the hospital stay (P<0.0001).

Global average of the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is about 7% so far. There exist variations in case fatality rates among countries. Particularly, Singapore and Qatar have exceptionally low case fatality rates with 0.1% while Frances rate is almost 20%. Since no magic bullet treatment for COVID-19 exists, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 strains specific to Singapore in this study to identify a clade with low pathogenicity. Variant analysis revealed that a clade with variants ORF1ab L3606F, A4489V, S2015R, T2016K, and N P13L is common in Singapore. Based on our analysis of variants and historical case statistics, the clade is dominant in a recent surge. Therefore, we suggest that low case fatality rate of Singapore possibly is attributed to the clade. Although contribution of each variant to the low pathogenicity is not clear, L3606F alone does not accomplish such low pathogenicity from the comparison with case fatality data from Japan, where L3606F is dominant.

At present, viral disease and transmission amongst children is incompletely understood. Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters. METHODS: We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms. FINDINGS: Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3/31) were identified as having a paediatric index case. This is in contrast other zoonotic infections (namely H5N1 influenza virus) where 54% (30/56) of transmission clusters identified children as the index case.

In this study, we explored potential natural pan-coronavirus drugs using in vitro and in silico approaches and three coronavirus main proteases as treatment targets. The PyRx program was used to screen 39,442 natural-product-like compounds from the ZINC database and 121 preselected phytochemicals from medicinal plants with known antiviral activity. After assessment with Lipinskis rule of five, molecular docking was performed for the top 33 compounds of both libraries. Enzymatic assays were applied for the top candidates from both in silico approaches to test their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The four compounds (hypericin, rosmarinic acid, isorhamnetin, and luteolin) that most efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) in vitro were further tested for their efficacy in inhibiting M(pro) of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Microscale thermophoresis was performed to determine dissociation constant (Kd) values to validate the binding of these active compounds to recombinant M(pro) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV. The cytotoxicity of hypericin, rosmarinic acid, isorhamnetin, and luteolin was assessed in human diploid MRC-5 lung fibroblasts using the resazurin cell viability assay to determine their therapeutic indices. Sequence alignment of M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated 96.08%, 50.83%, 49.17%, 48.51%, 44.04%, and 41.06% similarity to M(pro) of other human-pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E, respectively). Molecular docking showed that 12 out of 121 compounds were bound to SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) at the same binding site as the control inhibitor, GC376. Enzyme inhibition assays revealed that hypericin, rosmarinic acid, isorhamnetin, and luteolin inhibited M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2, while hypericin and isorhamnetin inhibited M(pro) of SARS-CoV-1; hypericin showed inhibitory effects toward M(pro) of MERS-CoV. Microscale thermophoresis confirmed the binding of these compounds to M(pro) with high affinity. Resazurin assays showed that rosmarinic acid and luteolin were not cytotoxic toward MRC-5 cells, whereas hypericin and isorhamnetin were slightly cytotoxic. We demonstrated that hypericin represents a potential novel pan-anti-coronaviral agent by binding to and inhibiting M(pro) of several human-pathogenic coronaviruses. Moreover, isorhamnetin showed inhibitory effects toward SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 M(pro), indicating that this compound may have some pan-coronaviral potential.

Current epidemiological studies suggest that COVID-19 affects older patients with multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and chronic lung diseases. The differences in the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are likely to be multifaceted, depending on various biological, social, and economical factors. Specifically, the socioeconomic differences and psychological impact of COVID-19 affecting males and females are essential in pandemic mitigation and preparedness. Previous clinical studies have shown that females are less susceptible to acquire viral infections and reduced cytokine production. Female patients have a higher macrophage and neutrophil activity as well as antibody production and response. Furthermore, in-vivo studies of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) showed higher expression in the kidneys of male than female patients, which may explain the differences in susceptibility and progression of COVID-19 between male and female patients. However, it remains unknown whether the expression of ACE2 differs in the lungs of male or female patients. Disparities in healthcare access and socioeconomic status between ethnic groups may influence COVID-19 rates. Ethnic groups often have higher levels of medical comorbidities and lower socioeconomic status, which may increase their risk of contracting COVID-19 through weak cell-mediated immunity.

By March 3, 2020, 17 of the 26 (attack rate: 65.4%) had become positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these 17 patients, nine were symptomatic, while eight did not show any symptoms. Of the nine who developed symptoms, six were mild, one was severe and two were critically ill. The median duration between the day of confirmation for COVID-19 and RT-PCR negativity was 18 days (range: 12-23 days). Two patients died with a case fatality of 11.8 per cent. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study reconfirms higher rates of transmission among close contacts and therefore, public health measures such as physical distancing, personal hygiene and infection control measures are necessary to prevent transmission.","output":"A cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection among Italian tourists visiting India, March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small-angle scattering emerged as a tool for studying noncrystalline structures from early observations around 1930 that there was a relationship between the extent of the scattering and the size of the scattering object.

Few studies examine the accuracy of paramedic performed FAST examinations. The duration of an ultrasound training program remains controversial. This study's purpose was to assess the accuracy of paramedic FAST exam interpretation following a one hour didactic training session. METHODS: The interpretation of paramedic performed FAST exams was compared to the interpretation of physician performed FAST examinations on a mannequin model containing 300ml of free fluid following a one hour didactic training course. Results were compared using the Chi-square test. Differences in accuracy rate were deemed significant if p < 0.05. RESULTS: Fourteen critical care flight paramedics and four emergency physicians were voluntarily recruited. The critical care paramedics were mostly ultrasound-naive whereas the emergency physicians all had ultrasound training. The correct interpretation of FAST scans was comparable between the two groups with accuracy of 85.6% and 87.5% (&#8710;1.79 95%CI -33.85 to 21.82, p = 0.90) for paramedics and emergency physicians respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study determined that critical care paramedics were able to use ultrasound to detect free fluid on a simulated mannequin model and interpret the FAST exam with a similar accuracy as experienced emergency physicians following a one hour training course. This suggests the potential use of prehospital ultrasound to aid in the triage and transport decisions of trauma patients while limiting the financial and logistical burden of ultrasound training.","output":"Abdominal ultrasound image acquisition and interpretation by novice practitioners after minimal training on a simulated patient model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the hepatoprotection of organic and conventional grapevine leaves extract (Vitis labrusca).

The results showed that the organic extract is richer in polyphenol and resveratrol than the conventional one. Both extracts prevent lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation generated by CCl4. Moreover, the extracts demonstrated ability to modulate the activity of SOD and CAT, as well as to establish a balance in the ratio of SOD/CAT.

Caspase-6 is a homodimer with 6 central-stranded -sheets and 5 -helices in each monomer. Previous crystallographic studies suggested that the 60s, 90s and 130s helices of caspase-6 undergo a distinctive conformational transition upon substrate binding. Although the caspase-6 structures in apo and active states have been determined, the conformational transition process between the two states remains poorly understood. In this work, perturbation-response scanning (PRS) combined with targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulations was employed to unravel the atomistic mechanism of the dynamic conformational transitions underlying the substrate-induced activation process of caspase-6. The results showed that the conformational transition of caspase-6 from apo to active states is mainly characterized by structural rearrangements of the substrate-binding site as well as the conformational changes of 60s and 130s extended helices. The H-bond interactions between L1, 130s helix and 90s helix are proved to be key determinant factors for substrate-induced conformational transition. These findings provide valuable insights into the activation mechanism of caspase-6 as well as the molecular design of caspase-6 inhibitors.","output":"Conformational transitions of caspase-6 in substrate-induced activation process explored by perturbation-response scanning combined with targeted molecular dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study investigates whether levels of social support moderate the association between age and stress among a sample of individuals who have a family member incarcerated.

Real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, this resource-intensive and relatively lengthy technique is not ideally suited for mass testing. While pooled testing offers substantial savings in cost and time, the size of the optimum pool that offers complete concordance with results of individualized testing remains elusive. To determine the optimum pool size, we first evaluated the utility of pool testing using simulated 5-sample pools with varying proportions of positive and negative samples. We observed that 5-sample pool testing resulted in false negativity rate of 5% when the pools contained one positive sample. We then examined the diagnostic performance of 4-sample pools in the operational setting of a diagnostic laboratory using 500 consecutive samples in 125 pools. With background prevalence of 2.4%, this 4-sample pool testing showed 100% concordance with individualized testing and resulted in 66% and 59% reduction in resource and turnaround time, respectively. Since the negative predictive value of a diagnostic test varies inversely with prevalence, we re-tested the 4-sample pooling strategy using a fresh batch of 500 samples in 125 pools when the prevalence rose to 12.7% and recorded 100% concordance and reduction in cost and turnaround time by 36% and 30%, respectively.

Present study highlights the deterrents to recruiting CCP donors at a hospital based blood centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential CCP donors were contacted individually by telephone and a group approach through camp organisers from May to July 2020. Recruitment challenges were noted and deferrals of these recruited donors during screening and medical examination was obtained and analysed. RESULTS: Total 1165 potential CCP donors were contacted. Around 47% donors were lost due to challenges related to information storage and retrieval. Fear of health, family pressure, and fear of a new procedure were major reason (27.2%) for unwillingness to donate. The main reasons for deferral among potential donors were multiparity (38%) and being overage/underage (31.6%). Finally, 468 donors were recruited including 408 by individual approach and 60 by a group approach. From these absence of detectable COVID\\\\19 antibodies were found in 15.4%. Few donors (9.0%) were deferred as they had not completed 28 days post recovery. CONCLUSION: The process of CCP donor recruitment differs from that of whole blood donation and requires an individualised approach with involvement of clinicians in the initial phases of the pandemic. A group approach targeting specific organisations could be adopted for a successful CCP collection program. There is a need to relook into some aspects of donor selection such as consideration of multiparous female donors and overage/underage donors after reviewing scientific evidence.","output":"Deterrents in recruitment of COVID\\\\19 convalescent plasma donors: Experience from a hospital\\\\based blood centre in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School absenteeism is an inefficient and unspecific metric for measuring community illness and does not provide surveillance during summertime.

Childcare providers were trained to report sick children who required exclusion or had parent-reported absences due to illness. Deidentified data on age range, number of illnesses, and illness categories were collected. Weekly electronic reports were sent to the county public health department. Data for reports were gathered beginning in December 2013 and were summarized using descriptive statistics. A total of 385 individual episodes of illness occurred during the study period. Children with reported illness were infants (16%, n = 61), toddlers (38%, n = 148), and preschoolers (46%, n = 176). Illness categories included: fever (30%, n = 116), gastroenteritis (30%, n = 115), influenzalike illness (8%, n = 32), cold without fever (13%, n = 51), rash (7%, n = 26), conjunctivitis (1%, n = 3), ear infection (1%, n = 5), and other (10%, n = 37).

Treatment by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) medication, among others, has been proposed. However, prophylactic HCQ medication has been little evaluated. We propose to use data from patients with rheumatic diseases (RA, SLR) who have been chronically taking HCQ medication since before the COVID-19 outbreak (hereafter: HCQpa), in order to evaluate the potential of HCQ for preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2. This can be achieved with relative ease by considering whether COVID-19 prevalence is significantly lower in HCQpa than in the general population (i.e., all people that are not HCQpa). Even if COVID-19 prevalence is truly significantly lower in HCQpa, some HCQpa may still present with COVID-19 (lower prevalence does not mean a prevalence of zero). However, given a value for COVID-19 prevalence in the general population and a number of available HCQpa, one may compute the maximum number of HCQpa for that total number of HCQpa considered that can have COVID-19 in order to still be able to conclude a lower COVID-19 prevalence in HCQpa (i.e., if there is one more case of COVID-19 than that maximum number, the COVID-19 prevalence in the HCQpa cannot be said to be lower than in the general population). Because the COVID-19 prevalence in the general population is not known with precision, we will consider different general population prevalence values. Among these contemplated prevalence values, one is derived from the official total number of confirmed cases, others by computing the total number of cases from the number of fatal COVID-19 cases so far and considering different case fatality rates per total cases. Our analyses show that systematic testing for COVID-19 in as few as 5,000 HCQpa is all that is needed for a test of whether HCQ has a prophylactic action against COVID-19, even for a COVID-19 prevalence value as low as 250 per 100,000, provided that test sensitivity is at least equal to its specificity. For higher COVID-19 prevalence values, the number of HCQpa needed is even lower.","output":"A Simple Bayesian Method for Evaluating Whether Data From Patients With Rheumatic Diseases Who Have Been Under Chronic Hydroxychloroquine Medication Since Before the COVID-19 Outbreak Can Speak to Hydroxychloroquine's Prophylactic Effect Against Infection With SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic variations in the COVID-19 virus are one of the main causes of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 and 2021.

We propose an Ensemble-based Dynamic Emission Model (EDEM) to address these limitations. EDEM is developed at the intersection of network science and ensemble learning, i.e., a specialized approach of machine learning. Generalized Additive Model (GAM), i.e., a variant of GLM, and EDEM are tested in Los Angeles and Ventura counties of California, which is one of the biggest SARS-CoV-2 clusters in the US. GAM depicts that a 1 g/m3, 1 g/m3, and 1 ppm increase (lag 0-7) in PM 2.5, PM 10, and O3 is associated with 4.51 % (CI: -7.01 to -2.00) decrease, 1.62 % (CI: -2.23 to -1.022) decrease, and 4.66 % (CI: 0.85 to 8.47) increase in daily SARS-CoV-2 cases, respectively. Subsequent increment in lag resulted in the negative association between pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 cases. EDEM results in an R2 score of 90.96% and 79.16% on training and testing datasets, respectively. EDEM confirmed the negative association between particulates and SARS-CoV-2 cases; whereas, the O3 depicts a positive association; however, the positive association observed through GAM is not statistically significant. In addition, the county-level analysis of pollutant concentration interactions suggests that increased emissions from other counties positively affect SARS-CoV-2 cases in adjoining counties as well.

Results Demographics, socioeconomic factors, and experiencing economic hardship during the pandemic each explained a statistically significant portion of vaccination coverage disparities between non-Hispanic White and racial/ethnic minority individuals. The largest disparity was observed among people who identified as Hispanic or Latino, whose vaccination coverage was 8.0 (95% CI=7.1, 8.9) percentage points lower than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. Socioeconomic factors explained 4.8 (95% CI=4.3, 5.2) percentage points of this disparity, and economic hardship explained an additional 1.4 (95% CI=1.2, 1.6) percentage points.

However, there is a limited understanding of their effectiveness. The aim of this study was to synthesise the evidence to understand the effectiveness of virtual patient tools aimed at improving undergraduate medical students clinical reasoning skills. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO from 1990 to January 2022, to identify all experimental articles testing the effectiveness of virtual patient educational tools on medical students clinical reasoning skills. Quality of the articles was assessed using an adapted form of the MERSQI and the NewcastleCOttawa Scale. A narrative synthesis summarised intervention features, how virtual patient tools were evaluated and reported effectiveness. RESULTS: The search revealed 8,186 articles, with 19 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Average study quality was moderate (M = 6.5, SD = 2.7), with nearly half not reporting any measurement of validity or reliability for their clinical reasoning outcome measure (8/19, 42%). Eleven articles found a positive effect of virtual patient tools on reasoning (11/19, 58%). Four reported no significant effect and four reported mixed effects (4/19, 21%). Several domains of clinical reasoning were evaluated. Data gathering, ideas about diagnosis and patient management were more often found to improve after virtual patient use (34/47 analyses, 72%) than application of knowledge, flexibility in thinking and problem-solving (3/7 analyses, 43%). CONCLUSIONS: Using virtual patient tools could effectively complement current teaching especially if opportunities for face-to-face teaching or other methods are limited, as there was some evidence that virtual patient educational tools can improve undergraduate medical students clinical reasoning skills. Evaluations that measured more case specific clinical reasoning domains, such as data gathering, showed more consistent improvement than general measures like problem-solving. Case specific measures might be more sensitive to change given the context dependent nature of clinical reasoning. Consistent use of validated clinical reasoning measures is needed to enable a meta-analysis to estimate effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the variation and evolution in use of repurposed medications for coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational cohort study of adults hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 between February 15, 2020, and April 12, 2021, across 76 United States and international hospitals within the Society of Critical Care Medicines Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study coronavirus disease 2019 registry. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital variation was quantified using multivariable adjusted random effects logistic regression models and unsupervised clustering. Repurposed medications included antivirals, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, immunomodulators, and therapeutic dose anticoagulants. RESULTS: Among 7,069 adults hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019, 1,979 (28%) received antivirals, 2,876 (41%) received corticosteroids, 1,779 (25%) received hydroxychloroquine, 620 (9%) received immunomodulators, and 2,154 (31%) received therapeutic dose anticoagulants. Contribution of hospital site to risk-adjusted variation was 46% for antivirals, 30% for corticosteroids, 48% for hydroxychloroquine, 46% for immunomodulators, and 52% for therapeutic dose anticoagulants. Compared with the early pandemic, the later pandemic practice phenotypes converged with increased use of antivirals (odds ratio, 3.14; 95% CI, 2.40C4.10) and corticosteroids (odds ratio, 5.43; 95% CI, 4.23C6.97), with decreased use of hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01C0.04) and immunomodulators (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34C0.70). There was no clinically significant change in the use of therapeutic dose anticoagulants (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01C1.02). There were no differences in risk-adjusted mortality between hospitals with high rates of repurposed medication use compared with hospitals with low rates of use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hospital variation in the use of repurposed medications varied widely across hospitals early in the pandemic and later converged with the emergence of randomized clinical trials. Platforms developed for rapid activation and enrollment in clinical trials of repurposed medications are needed prior to the next pandemic to expedite effective, evidence-based practice.","output":"Variation in Use of Repurposed Medications Among Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019.

In this study, we performed proteomic studies and identified several candidate autoantigens recognized by SARS patient sera in human lung type II epithelial cell A549. Among the candidate proteins, annexin A2, which was identified by mass spectrometry analysis and had the highest score by Mascot data search, was further characterized and investigated for its role as an autoantigen. By confocal microscopic observation, SARS patient sera and anti-S2 antibodies were co-localized on A549 cells and both of them were co-localized with anti-annexin A2 antibodies. Anti-annexin A2 antibodies bound to purified S2 proteins, and anti-S2 bound to immunoprecipitated annexin A2 from A549 cell lysate in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, an increased surface expression and raft-structure distribution of annexin A2 was present in A549 cells after stimulation with SARS-induced cytokines interleukin-6 and interferon-. Cytokine stimulation increased the binding capability of anti-S2 antibodies to human lung epithelial cells. Together, the upregulated expression of annexin A2 by SARS-associated cytokines and the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV S2 antibodies to annexin A2 may have implications in SARS disease pathogenesis.","output":"Annexin A2 on lung epithelial cell surface is recognized by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike domain 2 antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we formulate an SVITR deterministic model and extend it to a stochastic model by introducing intensity of stochastic factors and Brownian motion.

Early in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, HHFNC was underutilized due to concern for viral aerosolization. Studies have since shown that HHFNC has a similar aerosolization risk as a standard oxygen mask prompting increased usage of HHFNC in patients with SARS-CoV-2. We sought to determine if the usage of HHFNC reduced the odds of intubation or the number of ventilator days for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing electronic health record data from the University of Colorado Health System. We included all adult patients admitted to intensive care units between February 1st, 2020 and May 3rd, 2020 with a diagnosis of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and COVID-19. We divided patients into two groups: patients who received HHFNC and patients who did not receive HHFNC. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared. Results: A total of 193 patients were included, of which 41 (21.2%) received HHFNC support. Age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and comorbidities were similar between both groups. CRP was slightly higher and creatinine lower in the HHFNC group. We found that patients who used HHFNC were 76.5% less likely to receive mechanical ventilation (p&lt;0.001). Patients who were supported with HHFNC spent an average of 5.1 more days on mechanical ventilation (p=0.025). The odds of death were estimated to be 39.4% lower for those who used HHFNC after adjusting for confounders (age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol use, prone positioning, corticosteroid use and Remdesivir use) however this effect estimate was not statistically significant. Conclusions: We found that patients with COVID-19 who received HHFNC were less likely to be intubated, which is consistent with previously published data. Those who did require intubation remained on mechanical ventilation for a longer duration. Our study did not detect any differences in mortality between the HHFNC group and the non-HHFNC group. These findings suggest HHFNC may be a useful modality for treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 that may reduce the need for mechanical ventilators during local shortages.","output":"Assessing the use of heated high flow nasal cannula in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interest continues to grow regarding the role of serologic assays for the detection of prior infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

METHODS Fifteen semistructured interviews with practicing primary care physicians and physicians-in-training from a Southern California academic health system and group-model health maintenance organization were conducted to assess physician perspectives regarding the benefits and challenges of telemedicine. RESULTS Physicians indicated that telemedicine improved patient access to care by providing greater convenience, although some expressed concern that certain groups of vulnerable patients were unable to navigate or did not possess the technology required to participate in telemedicine visits. Physicians noted that telemedicine visits offered more time for patient counseling, opportunities for better medication reconciliations, and the ability to see and evaluate patient home environments and connect with patient families. Challenges existed when visits required a physical examination. Physicians were very concerned about the loss of personal connections and touch, which they believed diminished expected rituals that typically strengthen physician-patient relationships. Physicians also observed that careful consideration to physician workflows may be needed to avoid physician burnout. CONCLUSIONS Physicians reported that telemedicine visits offer new opportunities to improve the quality of patient care but noted changes to their interactions with patients. Many of these changes are positive, but it remains to be seen whether others such as lack of physical examination and loss of physical presence and touch adversely influence provider-patient communication, patient willingness to disclose concerns that may affect their care, and, ultimately, patient health outcomes.","output":"A Qualitative Study of Primary Care Physicians' Experiences With Telemedicine During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We usually use objective and subjective methods for examination of the eye astigmatism in optometry, respectively ophthalmology. Objective methods enable to measure sphere-cylindrical refraction of the eye. If we want to prescribe new glasses or contact lenses we usually use subjective methods. The aim of this study was to measure sensitivity and specificity of some subjective and objective methods for examination of the eye astigmatism. We supposed that automatic objective refraction will be the most exact method so we choose this method as the reference method. For comparison we chose subjective methods Jackson crossed cylinders (JCC), fogging method (FM) and objective method Spot Vision Screener (SVS, WelschAllyn). MATERIALS AND METHODS We had in total 30 subjects with average age 23 years (SD 1 year) in our study. We made each measurement per eye separately and it was independent measurement so we could use measurement from each eye (n = 60). Each eye was firstly measured by subjective method FM, followed by JCC method and finally was use objective method Spot Vision Screener (SVS, WelschAllyn). Measurement with objective instrument TRK-1P (TOPCON) was use as reference measurement. The significance level was set at p = 0.05. RESULTS In variable FM we measured sensitivity 76.2 % and specificity 66.7 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.25 D. Result was statistically significant on level p < 0.001. In variable JCC we measured sensitivity 95.2 % and specificity 66.7 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.25 D. Result was statistically significant on level p < 0.001. In variable SVS we measured sensitivity 47.6 % and specificity 94.4 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.75 D. Result was statistically significant on level p < 0.001. Direct comparison of all methods showed statistically important difference between techniques JCC and FM (p = 0.0095). In other method we did not find statistically important difference (FM vs. SVS, p = 0.526 and JCC vs. SVS, p = 0.105). CONCLUSION All subjective and objective techniques were statistically significant in detection of eye astigmatism. Comparison of ROC curves showed statistically significant difference between FM and JCC technique.

METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study. We evaluated the feasibility of a strategy based on the conversion of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations to manage IBD outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 4-item telephone survey (3 closed questions and a 100-point numeric description scale) was conducted to evaluate satisfaction of patients with telephone consultations. RESULTS: Between March 11 and April 8, 2020, 98% of the 216 scheduled face-to-face visits could be converted to telephone consultations, and we resolved an additional 162 urgent consultations by telephone. The rate of IBD-related hospitalization and visits to the emergency department decreased by 50% and 58%, respectively, compared with rates in the same period the previous year. The 4-item survey was conducted in 171 outpatients. In closed questions, patients reported a very high degree of satisfaction with telephone consultations, with no differences between scheduled (n = 123) and urgent consultations (n = 48; P = NS). The overall satisfaction rating with the telephone consultation evaluated with the numerical description scale was 94% and 93% for scheduled and urgent consultations, respectively (P < 0.82). Less than 20% of patients would have preferred a face-to-face visit to the telephone consultation at the time. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy based on the conversion of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations was able to guarantee a minimum standard quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Isolation of patients is a possible solution for controlling epidemic infectious diseases. We assessed the compliance of isolation and associated factors among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 320 COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals of Qazvin province. Patients isolation, self-care health behaviors, reference to public health services and possible related factors were assessed. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: In this study, 320 patients were enrolled, including 175 men (54.7%). Two hundred and eighty-six patients (89.4%) had complete isolation. Factors such as phone tracking by health center (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.75) and dry cough (OR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.09 to 5.09) increased odds of complete isolation in COVID-19 patients, but having a COVID-19 patient in the family (OR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.71) and symptoms of disease like shortness of breath (OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.85) and muscle pain (OR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.95) decreased odds ratio for these patients.

Data describing post-hospital discharge outcomes may provide insight into disease course. Studies describing post-hospitalization outcomes of adults following COVID-19 infection are limited to electronic medical record review, which may underestimate the incidence of outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine 30-day post-hospitalization outcomes following COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Quaternary referral hospital and community hospital in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 infected patients discharged alive from the emergency department (ED) or hospital between March 3 and May 15, 2020. MEASUREMENT: Outcomes included return to an ED, re-hospitalization, and mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-day follow-up data were successfully collected on 94.6% of eligible patients. Among 1344 patients, 16.5% returned to an ED, 9.8% were re-hospitalized, and 2.4% died. Among patients who returned to the ED, 50.0% (108/216) went to a different hospital from the hospital of the index presentation, and 61.1% (132/216) of those who returned were re-hospitalized. In Cox models adjusted for variables selected using the lasso method, age (HR 1.01 per year [95% CI 1.00-1.02]), diabetes (1.54 [1.06-2.23]), and the need for inpatient dialysis (3.78 [2.23-6.43]) during the index presentation were independently associated with a higher re-hospitalization rate. Older age (HR 1.08 [1.05-1.11]) and Asian race (2.89 [1.27-6.61]) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients discharged alive following their index presentation for COVID-19, risk for returning to a hospital within 30 days of discharge was substantial.

However, the positive impacts on the environment are not expected to last long as countries have started to gradually come out of lockdown and engage in aggressive measures to regain the pre-COVID-19 levels of economic activity. The present study provides for an assessment of air quality changes during the period of lockdown and unlocking across 9 major cities in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, including three cities (Ghaziabad, Noida, and Greater Noida) in the national capital region, which have frequently been included among the most polluted cities in the world. The pollutant load in a vertical column of air during March-July 2020 has been analyzed and compared with the corresponding period's pollution load in 2019. In addition, a detailed analysis of the ground-level changes in pollution load for Ghaziabad, Noida, and Greater Noida is also presented, along with the changes in local meteorology. A significant reduction in the total column density of NO2, CO and ground-level pollution load of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 have been observed. In contrast, an increase in total column density of SO2 across all the cities (except Kanpur) and ground-level concentration of CO (in Noida and Greater Noida) and O3 (in Noida) was evident. The improvement in air quality (with respect to particulate matter) can primarily be attributed to the restrictions on construction and demolition activities, reduced re-suspension of roadside dust, and the restrictions on the movement of vehicles. A significant decline in the average summer temperature was recorded, and it can plausibly be attributed to lower radiative forcing due to reduced pollutant load in the atmosphere.","output":"COVID-19 driven changes in the air quality; a study of major cities in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Debra Reicher, Ph D , Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook University School of Medicine, has some useful tips for children  and parents  on returning to school She issued these via the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) last summer [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Brown University Child & Adolescent Behavior Letter is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Transitioning back to in\\\\person school: Tips from AACAP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been widely spread all over the world. It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects a series of human tissues, including lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, etc. ACE2 has been identified as the primary receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. The relatively low expression level of this known receptor in the lungs, which is the predominantly infected organ in COVID-19, indicates that there may be some other co-receptors or alternative receptors of SARS-CoV-2 to work in coordination with ACE2. Here, we identified twenty-one candidate receptors of SARS-CoV-2, including ACE2-interactor proteins and SARS-CoV receptors. Then we investigated the protein expression levels of these twenty-one candidate receptors in different human tissues and found that five of which CAT, MME, L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, and AGTR2 were specifically expressed in SARS-CoV-2 affected tissues. Next, we performed molecular simulations of the above five candidate receptors with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and found that the binding affinities of CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN to S protein were even higher than ACE2. Interestingly, we also observed that CAT and AGTR2 bound to S protein in different regions with ACE2 conformationally, suggesting that these two proteins are likely capable of the co-receptors of ACE2. Conclusively, we considered that CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were the potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, AGTR2 and DC-SIGN tend to be highly expressed in the lungs of smokers, which is consistent with clinical phenomena of COVID-19, and further confirmed our conclusion. Besides, we also predicted the binding hot spots for these putative protein-protein interactions, which would help develop drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN are potential receptors for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the participation of the QMUL-SDS team for Task 1 of the CLEF 2020 CheckThat! shared task.

NSCLBP is a complex disorder with several risk factors contributing to its occurrence. Therefore, the objective of our study was to estimate the prevalence and contribution of risk factors towards NSCLBP among male soldiers in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2020 to January 2021 among the military personnel at Hafar Al-Batin military base, Saudi Arabia. The entire population (n = 62, 000) at the military base were invited to participate in the study. The participants were invited to participate in the study either through direct referral from in-patient and out-patient departments of the military hospital or by invitation through pamphlets, email, and advertisement across the offices and residential areas. Soldiers reporting lower back pain for at least 12 weeks were screened for inclusion criteria at the physical therapy department of the military hospital. Inclusion criteria included pain or discomfort originating from the lower back without any known spinal diseases. Participants with a systemic inflammatory disorder, trauma, neurological symptoms, and recent spinal surgery were excluded. All eligible participants were assessed for demographic variables and risk factors and complete the Rolland Morris Disability Questionnaire and WHO-Five Well-Being Index. RESULTS: This study identified a 46.3% prevalence of pain originating from the spine with a 2.7% prevalence of NSCLBP.

RESULTS The concentration of cathepsin K in the gingival fluid in the patients of the control group was 1.70.3 pmol/l, in the comparison group the concentration of the studied biomarker corresponded to 2.30.4 pmol/l. In the main group, the concentration of cathepsin K in the exudate of peri-implantation pockets increased 2.8 times (p<0.05) and corresponded to 4.90.5 pmol/l. The concentration of cathepsin K in the gingival fluid normally did not depend on age and gender, which increased the independence of the osteomarker for characterizing the osteoresorbent process in the peri-implantation area. After dental implantation, an excess of cathepsin K concentration above the level of 2.7 pmol/l with a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.5% and a specificity of 83.7% suggests a high risk of developing peri-implantitis. CONCLUSION The concentration of cathepsin K may be seen as valuable marker for local inflammatory and destructive processes in the contents of the peri-implantation area.","output":"[Diagnostic possibilities of laboratory assessment of cathepsin K activity in gingival and peri-implant fluid under normal conditions and periimplantitis]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 demonstrate liver function damage. In this study, the laboratory test data of patients with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 were used to establish and evaluate an early prediction model to assess the risk of liver function damage. METHODS: Clinical data and the first laboratory examination results of 101 patients with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 were collected from four hospitals electronic medical record systems in Jilin Province, China. Data were randomly divided into training and validation sets. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent factors related to liver function damage in patients in the training set to establish a prediction model. Model discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness were evaluated in the training and validation sets. RESULTS: The logistic regression analysis showed that plateletcrit, retinol-binding protein, and carbon dioxide combining power could predict liver function damage (P < 0.05 for all). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed high model discrimination (training set area under the curve: 0.899, validation set area under the curve: 0.800; P < 0.05). The calibration curve showed a good fit (training set: P = 0.59, validation set: P = 0.19; P > 0.05). A decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical usefulness of this model.

Systems thinking is a rich discipline that studies nonlinear models of social complex adaptive systems that has many insights and tools that are relevant for modelling and understanding how interactions unfold in educational systems. An important insight of systems thinking is that the root cause of chronic complex problems often lay in the underlying systemic structure. Using insights from systems thinking to study learning/education has many benefits, including: (1) support for rigorous big-picture thinking;(2) anticipating and managing unintended consequences;(3) understanding dysfunctional learning systems using systems archetypes - which are systemic structures that, experts have noticed, typically lead to a performance rut;and finally (4) identification of high-leverage interventions that lead to long-lasting benefits without being neutralized by the system. In the paper, we have modelled COVID-19 pandemic effects on students learning in a novel way by using system thinking tools (Causal Loop Diagrams and Stock and Flow Diagrams), which help us to understand the complex interconnections of students performance, learning and management reforms.

ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.

We prospectively investigate whether clinical providers could accurately predict ED return visits. METHODS: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single academically affiliated urban county hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Discharged ED patients over a 14-month period with a provider assessment of the likelihood of patient return within 7 days of ED discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was a return visit to the ED within 7 days. Additional outcome measures included a return visit within 72 hours and a return visit resulting in admission. We also measured the accuracy of provider gestalt, and provide measures of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios. RESULTS: Of the 11 922 ED discharges included in this study, providers expected 2116 (17.7%) to result in a return visit within 7 days. Providers were much more likely to perceive a return visit if the patient left against medical advice (OR: 5.97, 95% CI: 4.67 to 7.62), or was homeless (OR: 5.69, 95% CI: 5.14 to 6.29). Patients who actually returned were also more likely to be homeless, English speaking and to have left the ED against medical advice on the initial encounter. The strongest predictor of a return visit at both 72 hours and 7 days in multivariable modelling was provider assessment (OR: 3.77, 95% CI: 3.25 to 4.37; OR: 3.72, 95% CI: 3.29 to 4.21, respectively).

The ethanol exposure reduced the epithelial short-circuit currents (I(SC)) in a dose-dependent manner. The ion currents activated by adenosine were chloride conductance mediated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel. Alloxazine, a specific inhibitor for A(2B) adenosine receptor (A(2B)AR), largely abolished the adenosine-stimulated chloride transport, suggesting that A(2B)AR is a major receptor responsible for regulating the chloride transport of the cells. Ethanol significantly reduced intracellular cAMP production upon adenosine stimulation. Moreover, ethanol-suppression of the chloride secretion was able to be restored by cAMP analogs or by inhibitors to block cAMP degradation.

ICU patients chest CT demonstrated higher incidence of consolidation (p=0.03), mixed lesions (p=0.01), bilateral opacities (p<0.01) and overall greater lung involvement by consolidation (p=0.02) and GGO (p=0.001). Conclusions: CT imaging features of ICU patients affected by COVID-19 are significantly different compared with non-ICU patients. Identification of CT features could assist in a stratification of the disease severity and supportive treatment.","output":"CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in ICU-patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has created pressure on the education system to find alternatives to face-to-face education. Consequently, teachers and students have used online teaching and learning on an unparalleled scale. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the Bahauddin Zakariy University (BZU) students' attitude toward learning and mainly examine the problems associated with taking online classes during COVID-19 in a developing country like Pakistan. The cross-sectional design was used to fulfill the study requirements. For the data collection, an online Google form was designed and circulated via a link to students enrolled in different programs at BZU. The result revealed that students have an enthusiastic attitude to using the online medium and would like to use online learning in the future or after the pandemic goes away. The highlighted issues include an inappropriate study environment, a disparity of gadget availability, inadequate online study content, no access or slow internet speed, and electricity load shedding. The above problems negatively affect students' studies in terms of minimum or no students' involvement and proxy attendance in the online class. In addition, the health of students is also reported as being seriously affected by attending online classes. Students had weak eyesight, increased weight, sleep deprivation, and behavioral problems. Overall, students showed a positive attitude and generous support from their teachers in the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, teachers play a fundamental role in helping students to make digital learning more valuable.","output":"Students Attitude and Impact of Online Learning;Role of Teachers and Classmate Support During the Covid-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every aspect of life including youth sports. Little data exists on COVID-19 incidences and risk mitigation strategies in youth club sports. OBJECTIVE To determine the reported incidence of COVID-19 cases among youth club sport athletes and the information sources used to develop COVID-19 risk mitigation procedures. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Online surveys. PATIENTS Soccer and volleyball youth club directors. INTERVENTION A survey was completed by directors of youth volleyball and soccer clubs across the country in October 2020. Surveys included self-reported date of re-initiation, number of players, player COVID-19 cases, sources of infection, COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and information sources for the development of COVID-19 mitigation strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Total number of cases reported, number of players, and days since club re-initiation were used to calculate an incidence rate of cases per 100,000 player-days. To compare reported incidence rates between soccer and volleyball, a negative binomial model was developed to predict player cases with sport and state incidence as covariates and log(player-days) as an offset. Estimates were exponentiated to yield a reported incidence rate ratio (IRR) with Wald confidence intervals. RESULTS A total of 205,136 athletes (soccer=165,580; volleyball=39,556) were represented by 437 clubs (soccer=159; volleyball=278). Club organizers reported 673 COVID-19 cases (soccer=322; volleyball=351), for a reported incidence rate of 2.8 cases per 100,000 player-days (soccer=1.7, volleyball=7.9). Volleyball had a significantly higher reported COVID-19 incidence rate compared to soccer (reported IRR = 3.06 [2.0-4.6], p<0.001). Out of 11 possible mitigation strategies, the median number of strategies used by all clubs was 7 with an interquartile range of 2. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of self-reported cases of COVID-19 was lower in soccer clubs than volleyball clubs.

As the pandemic outspread, healthcare professionals need urgent interventions to control the harmful consequences. Encountering such a crisis makes them more prone to negative psychological ramifications in their work environment, making them unable to provide the proper support. Burnout is the most negative feeling increased among healthcare professionals while compacting the virus. One essential move to remedy the impacts of burnout is understanding its determinants and their causal relationships. This paper addresses the design of a computational (cognitive) agent model of burnout for healthcare professionals using a temporal-causal network model. Several determinants of burnout with their causal relationships were identified from the literature and formalised to construct the proposed cognitive agent model. In addition, different simulation experiments were implemented to obtain a clear insight into the causal relationships among burnout determinants and those experiments are exhibited similar behaviours to exiting literature. Furthermore, the developed model was evaluated using two different methods: mathematical analysis to prove its implementation was achieved right and automated logical verification to check several properties as shown in the literature to confirm that the suitable model was built.

Logistic regression with multiple adjustments (e.g., comorbidities, cancer status, baseline COVID-19 severity) was performed. Hydroxychloroquine with any other drug was associated with increased mortality versus treatment with any COVID-19 treatment other than hydroxychloroquine or untreated controls; this association was not present with hydroxychloroquine alone. Remdesivir had numerically reduced mortality versus untreated controls that did not reach statistical significance. Baseline COVID-19 severity was strongly associated with receipt of any treatment. Black patients were approximately half as likely to receive remdesivir as white patients. Although observational studies can be limited by potential unmeasured confounding, our findings add to the emerging understanding of patterns of care for patients with cancer and COVID-19 and support evaluation of emerging treatments through inclusive prospective controlled trials. SIGNIFICANCE: Evaluating the potential role of COVID-19 treatments in patients with cancer in a large observational study, there was no statistically significant 30-day all-cause mortality benefit with hydroxychloroquine or high-dose corticosteroids alone or in combination; remdesivir showed potential benefit.

METHOD: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on public health workers from May to August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via email and telegram services. Both descriptive statistics and bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify distribution patterns and factors associated with exposure risks to COVID-19. Odds ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a P-value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULT: A total of 418 health care workers participated in the study with a response rate of 99.1%. The majority of the study participants 310(74.2%), were males, and 163(39%) were nurses/ midwives respectively.

However, heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 testing may introduce biased estimates depending on analytic design. We aimed to explore the potential for collider bias in a large study of disease determinants, and evaluate individual, environmental and social determinants associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and diagnosis among residents of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We explored the potential for collider bias and characterized individual, environmental and social determinants of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million community-dwelling people in Ontario, Canada. Among those with a diagnosis, we used separate analytic designs to compare predictors of people testing positive versus negative; symptomatic people testing positive versus testing negative; and people testing positive versus people not testing positive (i.e., testing negative or not being tested). Our analyses included tests conducted between Mar. 1 and June 20, 2020. RESULTS: Of 14 695 579 people, we found that 758 691 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 25 030 (3.3%) had a positive test result. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability we generally observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual factors. We found that there was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic designs.

Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens because of their immunosuppressive state and physiological adaptive change during pregnancy. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess knowledge and practice to prevent coronavirus disease and its associated factors among pregnant women in Debre Tabor Town. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 participants from May 25-June 15, 2020. A simple random sampling technique was employed. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire and analysis using SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out and p-value < 0.05 at 95% CI were considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS: Results revealed that the pandemic led to increased psychological distress. Compared to prior to its advent, more people sought help in the initial months of the outbreak. Furthermore, associations were found between the severity of the outbreak and the number of help-seeker mentioning the pandemic, as well as between the outbreak severity and the number of help-seekers disclosing psychological distress. However, these relationships were not uniform across the four waves of outbreaks; a dissociation between outbreak severity and help-seekers' concern was found in the fourth wave.

This new estimator yields sensible estimates of reproduction numbers both on the country and county level.

Logistic and MaAsLin regression were employed to assess associations between vitamin D supplementation, and C. difficile colonization, or other gut microbiota, respectively. Sixty-five percent of infants received a vitamin D supplement.

In line, low platelet counts represent a hallmark for poor prognosis in many infectious diseases. The underlying cause of platelet dysfunction in viral infections is multifaceted and complex. While some viruses directly interact with platelets and/or megakaryocytes to modulate their function, also immune and inflammatory responses directly and indirectly favour platelet activation. Platelet activation results in increased platelet consumption and degradation, which contributes to thrombocytopenia in these patients. The role of platelets is often bi-phasic. Initial platelet hyper-activation is followed by a state of platelet exhaustion and/or hypo-responsiveness, which together with low platelet counts promotes bleeding events. Thereby infectious diseases not only increase the thrombotic but also the bleeding risk or both, which represents a most dreaded clinical complication. Treatment options in these patients are limited and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to prevent adverse outcome.

We excluded participants who had CKD at baseline, defined as the presence of proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2. We compared two groups of CAVI measurements-the highest quartile (a?8.1) and the combined lower three quartiles (<8.1).

When incorporated into masks, these advanced materials and technologies can aid in the prevention of secondary transmission of the virus.","output":"Masks for COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies are crucial to immune protection against SARS-CoV-2, with some in emergency use as therapeutics. Here we identify 377 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the virus spike, and focus mainly on 80 that bind the receptor binding domain (RBD). We devise a competition data driven method to map RBD binding sites. We find that although antibody binding sites are widely dispersed, neutralizing antibody binding is focused, with nearly all highly inhibitory mAbs (IC50<0.1g/ml) blocking receptor interaction, except for one that binds a unique epitope in the N-terminal domain. Many of these neutralizing mAbs use public V-genes and are close to germline. We dissect the structural basis of recognition for this large panel of antibodies through X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy of 19 Fab-antigen structures. We find novel binding modes for some potently inhibitory antibodies and demonstrate that strongly neutralizing mAbs protect, prophylactically or therapeutically, in animal models.","output":"The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The class I and class II Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA) are an integral part of the host adaptive immune system against viral infections. The characterization of HLA allele frequency in the population can play an important role in determining whether HLA antigens contribute to viral susceptibility. In this regard, global efforts are currently underway to study possible correlations between HLA alleles with the occurrence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, this study examined the possible association between specific HLA alleles and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in a population from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The frequencies of HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) and HLA class II alleles (HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1); defined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS); from 115 UAE nationals with mild, moderate, and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented here. HLA alleles and supertypes were compared between hospitalized and non-hospitalized subjects. Statistical significance was observed between certain HLA alleles and supertypes and the severity of the infection. Specifically, alleles HLA-B*51:01 and HLA-A*26:01 showed a negative association (suggestive of protection), whilst genotypes HLA-A*03:01, HLA-DRB1*15:01, and supertype B44 showed a positive association (suggestive of predisposition) to COVID-19 severity. The results support the potential use of HLA testing to differentiate between patients who require specific clinical management strategies.","output":"HLA repertoire of 115 UAE nationals infected with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019 a human coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged, likely from a zoonotic reservoir. This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro. 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CLpro. This experimentally optimized reporter assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 400,000 deaths and innumerable changes to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. This reporter-based assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis. This assay may help identify novel antivirals to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Development of a fluorescence based, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study aims to examine the effects of mortality salience effects on worldview defense in an offline and online setting.

The impact of these aggregated measures have caused not only loss of lives but also financial, economic, social and even political unrest around the world and Uganda has not been spared either, given its weak economic and health care system (UBOS 2020). This study thus was designed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures and its associated self-reported threat on the female labor force participation ( FLFP ) in Uganda following the March 20 th 2020 shutdown of the economy by the government. The interest in women in this study stems from the fact that despite economic activity shutdown, womens work and roles extend beyond their office space to their home. Therefore using the first round of the Uganda High-Frequency Phone Survey on COVID-19 (UHFS) dataset conducted by Uganda Bureau of Statistic (UBOS) following the lockdown measure, our results indicates a 17% reduction in FLFP in the early days of the economic shutdown. We further find larger impacts of lockdown on female labor force participation in extreme cases where both partners are under locked down. These impacts are more pronounced among women with children as opposed to those without children. Conversely our results indicates larger impacts of lockdown among those with initial conditions of unemployment prior to the outbreak than those who were employed in time following the pandemic outbreak. We see our results as being consistent with the famous household labor theories. Our results point to the need for preferential treatment for women to encourage and enhance their labor market participation in times of pandemic.

A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cross-sectional sample of 30 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. T cells were evaluated using a 28-marker phenotypic panel, and findings were modelled against time from diagnosis, humoral and inflammatory responses. There were 132 SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses detected across six different HLAs, corresponding to 52 unique epitope reactivities. CD8+ T cell responses were detected in almost all convalescent individuals and were directed against several structural and non-structural target epitopes from the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. A unique phenotype for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed that was distinct from other common virus-specific T cells detected in the same cross-sectional sample and characterized by early differentiation kinetics. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a specific CD8+ T cell response. Overall, T cells exhibited distinct differentiation into stem-cell and transitional memory states, subsets, which may be key to developing durable protection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody therapeutics and vaccines are among our last resort to end the raging COVID-19 pandemic.They, however, are prone to over 1,800 mutations uncovered by a Mutation Tracker.

Additionally, we build a library of antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we deduce that some of the mutations such as M153I, S254F, and S255F may weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies, and potentially disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines in the development.

However, there is no mechanism for checking data permission in VM during VM migration, and there is concern that inappropriate data movement may occur. This includes the unintended risky movement of inappropriate data which could be malicious data.

Guidelines recommend checking inhaler technique at each clinical visit. However, they do not specify how best to train children to mastery of correct inhaler technique. Many children are simply shown how to use inhalers which results in less than 50% with correct inhaler technique. The aim of this scoping review is to explore published literature on teaching methods used to train children to master correct inhaler technique. METHODS: We searched (from inception onwards): Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL and the Cochrane library. We included quantitative studies, (e.g. randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and case-control studies), published from 1956 to present, on teaching inhaler technique to children with asthma. Data was extracted onto a data charting table to create a descriptive summary of the results. Data was then synthesised with descriptive statistics and visual mapping. RESULTS: Thirty-three papers were identified for full text analysis. Educational interventions were found to be taking place in a variety of clinical areas and by a range of healthcare professional disciplines. Brief-Instruction and Teach-Back were identified as two primary methods of providing inhaler technique training in the majority of papers. Secondary themes identified were; use of written instruction, physical demonstration, video demonstrations and/or use of inhaler devices to augment inhaler technique training. CONCLUSION: There are a variety of means by which inhaler technique has been taught to children. These methods are likely applicable to all inhaler types and often involve some form of physical demonstration. Children of all ages can be trained to use their inhaler correctly and by a range of healthcare professionals. We have not analysed the effectiveness of these different interventions, but have described what has been trialled before in an attempt to focus our attentions on what may potentially work best. The majority of these methods can be dichotomised to either Brief-Intervention or Teach-Back. Based on our analysis of this scoping review, we consider the following as areas for future research; how many times does a given intervention have to be done in order to have the desired effect? For what duration does the intervention need to continue to have a long-lasting effect? And, what is the best outcome measure for inhaler technique?.

The protocols advocate the use of rapid antigenic tests that require evaluation in actual clinical practice. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic test for rapid antigen detection, Panbio Covid rapid test, compared with PCR, in patients with symptoms of 5 or less days of evolution and with a high suspicion of infection by covid-19 in a health center. Materials and Methods: 103 patients over 14 years of age who attended an urban health center located in the Usera District of Madrid, with high suspicion of covid-19 infection, in the first 5 days of evolution from the onset of symptoms during the month of November 2020. Interventions: diagnostic tests for Covid-19 are performed: antigen and PCR. Results: The prevalence of the disease was 24.3% according to the PCR test and 17.5% according to the rapid antigenic test. The sensitivity was 72% (95% CI: 54.3-89.6%). The specificity was 100%. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 91.8% respectively. In the bivariate analysis, there was no relationship between symptoms and the presence of disease, except for myalgias (p = 0.030). The multivariate analysis found a relationship between cough, dyspnea, fever, myalgia, anosmia / ageusia, and ocular symptoms and the presence of disease. Conclusions: the sensitivity and specificity for the Panbio rapid antigen test are similar to other studies performed in primary care. In high prevalence of disease and with highly suspected symptoms, positive test results can be considered definitive, but negative results will require confirmation.

The ASCOT-Carer has been developed to measure carer's own SCRQoL. This study sought to establish the factors related to SCRQoL of people living with dementia (PLWD, proxy-reported by carers) and their carers. Data were collected via a self-administered postal or online survey of 313 carers in England, from January 2020 to April 2021. Carers were eligible if they supported someone living with dementia at home, who was unable to self-complete questionnaires. The person living with dementia or their carer had to use at least one social care service, e.g. home care. We recruited participants via an online volunteer panel and NHS sites. Multiple regression was applied to explore the factors significantly related to ASCOT SCRQoL by self- and proxy-report. Key influences on carers' own SCRQoL were their health, financial difficulties associated with caring, and satisfaction with social care support. Inadequate home design was significantly negatively associated with SCRQoL for PLWD. The latter stages of the pandemic-related restrictions (the tier system from 2nd December 2020 to study end, April 2021) were associated with significantly worse SCRQoL for PLWD, but not for carers.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide protects the lung against a broad array of injuries by binding to the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 receptor of alveolar type II cells, the cells that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 binds to. As the role of Aviptadil in treating pregnant patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia is unknown, the authors report successful treatment in such a patient who is ineligible for phase 3 trials of Aviptadil. CASE SUMMARY: Under an open-label Food and Drug Administration-approved Expanded Access Protocol NCT04453839, a 32-year-old female patient Gravida 6 Para 4 at 27-week gestation, body mass index 42.5 kg/m(2), admitted to the ICU of a quaternary care hospital with critical coronavirus disease 2019 was treated in January 2021 and followed for 4 months post-ICU admission. Standard of care included remdesivir, methylprednisolone, enoxaparin, and inhaled epoprostenol. In addition, the patient received three successive 12-hour IV infusions of Aviptadil at 50/100/150 pmol/kg/hr escalating doses, per randomized clinical trial NCT04311697. Human subjects protection was overseen by the Institutional Review Board of the Houston Methodist Hospital. The patient was enrolled in the treatment and was given informed consent approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the Institutional Review Board. Data on the patient was incorporated based on her consent for de-identified data to be used in research given at the time of hospital admission in a manner approved by the Institutional Review Board (PRO00025607). Baseline inflammatory markers, arterial blood gases, radiologic imaging, oxygen requirements, Pao(2)/Fio(2), continuous fetal monitoring at baseline, throughout the patients treatment with the investigational drug, and throughout the patients hospital course. CONCLUSION: The rapid clinical improvement seen in this patient treated with IV vasoactive intestinal peptide is consistent with the theory that vasoactive intestinal peptide protects the alveolar type II cell, ameliorates cytokine storm, and improves oxygenation in acute lung injury. This specific role of vasoactive intestinal peptide in the lung may be vital to combating the lethal effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. In addition, the role of vasoactive intestinal peptide in the human maternal-fetal interface suggests that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a safe treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 respiratory failure during pregnancy.","output":"Brief Report: Rapid Clinical Recovery From Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019 With Respiratory Failure in a Pregnant Patient Treated With IV Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses enter the host cell by binding cellular receptors that allow appropriate delivery of the viral genome.

The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared with other popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution neural network) and single shot detector (SSD) in terms of mean average precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index term is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol. From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort tracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score to monitor the social distancing in real-time.","output":"Monitoring COVID-19 social distancing with person detection and tracking via fine-tuned YOLO v3 and Deepsort techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Wearing facial masks, hand hygiene, and social distancing are highly recommended preventive measures against COVID-19. Masks and disinfectants are usually sold in community pharmacies that are supposed to undertake extreme precautions to avoid cross infection among clients. It is also their responsibility to play a prominent role in educating the community regarding this outbreak. Objectives To investigate the preparedness of private community pharmacies in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, for the COVID-19 outbreak with regard to safety measures, customer education, and quality of preventive aids sold by them. Methods One hundred pharmacies were visited by simulated clients. The availability of free hand disinfectants, masks, gloves, and customer educational aids as well as the measures employed to ensure maintenance of safe distances between customers were documented. The adherence of pharmacists and customers to safety precautions and the behavior of pharmacists against violators of regulations were also observed. Finally, the availability and quality of facial masks and hand disinfectants sold by these pharmacies was documented. Results Fifty-five pharmacies offered free hand disinfectants but only in three of them all customers used them. Only two pharmacies offered free disposable masks and temperature screening was available in only one pharmacy. Educational aids were found in 31 pharmacies and only 53 pharmacies used visual indicators for social distancing. Violation of wearing masks by pharmacy personnel and customers was seen in 34 and 87 pharmacies, respectively. Social distancing was violated in 64 pharmacies and intervention by staff was seen in only three of them. Finally, facial masks were available for sale in only 35 pharmacies, and in 23 of these, the quality was questionable; hand disinfectants were available in 84 pharmacies, and in 14 of these, the quality was unknown. Conclusions Community pharmacies in Madinah were short of registered, high-quality facial masks during the survey. Means to control the transmission of infection inside pharmacies were unsatisfactory. Society has shown poor compliance to preventive measures against COVID-19 infection and the role of community pharmacists in promoting compliance was found to be poor. The study reveals an unsatisfactory level of preparedness of Madinah community pharmacies for the pandemic.","output":"Community Pharmacy Services and Preparedness during COVID-19 Outbreak in Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The present study was undertaken to investigate epidemiological distribution, clinical manifestation, co morbid status, treatment strategy and case fatality index of emerging COVID-19 infection at SMS Medical College Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan. It also evaluated efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treatment of patients and risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in relation to their co morbid status. Materials and methods: In an attempt to provide extensive information pertaining to epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, the present study was undertaken on 522 patients. The patients were COVID-19 confirmed positive by genomic analysis through Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at SMS Medical College and Attached Hospitals, Jaipur. The indoor admitted patient's information inclusive of demographic profile (age, sex, nationality, residence), date of confirmation for positive COVID-19 case, travel/ exposure history, date of recovery/ death, clinical features, co morbidities and treatment plan was recorded. A serial follow-up of recovered patients to evaluate infective period of the disease was also part of the study. Results: A total of 522 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test by RT-PCR at SMS Hospitals, Jaipur were assessed. Among the confirmed cases, most of patients were young adult in the age group with mean age of 35.42 years. 22.41% patients were below 20 years of age, majority of patients (58.80%) were in the age range of 21 to 50 years and only 18.79% patient population was in the age range of above 50 years. Females (39.08%) were affected less than males (60.91%) with an average sex ratio of female: male being 0.64. Out of the total analyzed patients, only 24.32% patients were symptomatic, among them fever (55.90%), cough (52.75%), sore throat (49.60%) and shortness of breath (46.45%) were the most common presenting clinical manifestations while a few patients also had symptoms of headache (26.77%), chest pain (6.29%) and other symptoms (7.87%) like pain abdomen, fatigue, joints pain, altered sensorium etc. Most of symptomatic patients belonging to older age group. An average of 40.40% patient population of above 50 years of age, were symptomatic while none of the patients below 10 years of age were symptomatic. 13.98% patients had some or the other underlying co morbid disease. The most prevalent co morbidity was hypertension (42.46%) followed by Diabetes mellitus (39.72%), Old k-chest (20.54%), COPD/ Bronchial Asthma (16.43%), Coronary artery disease (13.69%), Chronic kidney disease (13.69%) and Valvular heart disease (6.84%) distributed in co morbid patients of COVID-19. 60.27% of patient population with underlying co morbid conditions were more prone to develop symptomatology complex as compared to that observed in patients with no co morbidity (18.42%). 116 patients had recovered with effective treatment till the date of data analysis. Time of recovery was counted from the date of positive report to 1st negative report of oropharyngeal sample by RT-PCR for COVID-19 with an average recovery time of 8.15 days. 23.27% patients recovered within 5 days, while 52.58% patients took about 6-10 days, 23.27% patients took 11-15 days and remaining 0.86% took more than 16 days to recover. In the present study 15 patients had died till analysis of data, among the deceased, 73.33% were above 50 year of age with a male preponderance (66.6%). Interestingly, all deceased (100%) had presented with clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and all had underlying multiple co morbid conditions. Majority of patients had early mortality after admission to hospital with two third death account in initial three days. Asymptomatic patients (cases) treated with HCQ recovered early (average recovery time =5.4 days) compared to asymptomatic patients who did not receive any treatment (control group) and had longer recovery time (average recovery time =7.6 days). Conclusion: The varied spectra of COVID-19 mostly affects young adult age group (third to fifth decades of life). Interestingly, early age group was also affected in significant proportion when compared with similar data from other countries. It was observed that male population seemed to be was more prone to getting infected. Majority of COVID-19 positive patients (nearly three-fourth) were asymptomatic (mostly in young age range) at the time of diagnosis, which poses a major challenge for health care workers. Fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath were major symptoms that could be detected in such COVID-19 patients. Symptomatic clinical manifestations were more common in old age population. Infectivity was higher in patients that had underlying co morbid disease, especially in patients with multiple co morbid conditions. Symptomatic presentation of COVID-19 was observed to be higher in patients with co morbid disease. Average recovery time from COVID-19 was 8 days with effective treatment. Mortality in COVID-19 was higher in old age population, male gender, symptomatic and co morbid patients as compared to other similarly matched group. Most of mortality was noted within first few days of admission, suggestive of early mortality due to the primary disease process. Treatment with HCQ had early recovery without effectively influencing the overall mortality.","output":"Characteristics, Treatment Outcomes and Role of Hydroxychloroquine among 522 COVID-19 hospitalized patients in Jaipur City: An Epidemio-Clinical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract China has been performing nationwide social lockdown by releasing the Level 1 response to major public health emergencies (RMPHE) to struggle against the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak since late January 2020. During the Level 1 RMPHE, social production and public transport were maintained at minimal levels, and residents stayed in and worked from home. The universal impact of anthropogenic activities on air pollution can be evaluated by comparing it with air quality under such extreme conditions. We investigated the concentration of both gaseous and particulate pollutants and aerosol light absorption at different levels of (RMPHE) in an urban area of southwestern China. During the lockdown, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, and BC decreased by 30C50%, compared to the pre-Level 1 RMPHE period. Meanwhile, the decrease of NOx caused the rise of O3 by up to 2.3 times due to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) limitation. The aerosol light absorption coefficient at multiple wavelengths decreased by 50%, and AAE decreased by 20% during the Level 1 RMPHE. BrC played essential roles in light absorption after the RMPHE was announced, accounting for 54.0% of the aerosol absorption coefficient at 370 nm. Moreover, the lockdown down-weighted the fraction of fossil fuel in BC concentrations to 0.43 (minima). This study characterizes air pollution at the most basic level and can provide policymakers with references for the baseline.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and control measures on air quality and aerosol light absorption in Southwestern China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Latinx individuals, particularly immigrants, are at higher risk than non-Latinx White individuals of contracting and dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Little is known about Latinx experiences with COVID-19 infection and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To describe the experiences of Latinx individuals who were hospitalized with and survived COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The qualitative study used semistructured phone interviews of 60 Latinx adults who survived a COVID-19 hospitalization in public hospitals in San Francisco, California, and Denver, Colorado, from March 2020 to July 2020. Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Data analysis was conducted from May 2020 to September 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Themes and subthemes that reflected patient experiences. RESULTS: Sixty people (24 women and 36 men; mean [SD] age, 48 [12] years) participated. All lived in low-income areas, 47 participants (78%) had more than 4 people in the home, and most (44 participants [73%]) were essential workers. Four participants (9%) could work from home, 12 (20%) had paid sick leave, and 21 (35%) lost their job because of COVID-19. We identified 5 themes (and subthemes) with public health and clinical care implications: COVID-19 was a distant and secondary threat (invincibility, misinformation and disbelief, ingrained social norms); COVID-19 was a compounder of disadvantage (fear of unemployment and eviction, lack of safeguards for undocumented immigrants, inability to protect self from COVID-19, and high-density housing); reluctance to seek medical care (worry about health care costs, concerned about ability to access care if uninsured or undocumented, undocumented immigrants fear deportation); health care system interactions (social isolation and change in hospital procedures, appreciation for clinicians and language access, and discharge with insufficient resources or clinical information); and faith and community resiliency (spirituality, Latinx COVID-19 advocates). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In interviews, Latinx patients with COVID-19 who survived hospitalization described initial disease misinformation and economic and immigration fears as having driven exposure and delays in presentation. To confront COVID-19 as a compounder of social disadvantage, public health authorities should mitigate COVID-19Crelated misinformation, immigration fears, and challenges to health care access, as well as create policies that provide work protection and address economic disadvantages.","output":"Experiences of Latinx Individuals Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this paper, we seek to review coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated kidney injury with a focus on what is known about pathophysiology.

The aim of this study is to compare pre- and post-COVID-19 payments between industry and medical providers for all plastic surgeons. METHODS: Payment information was collected for the 2019 and 2020 reporting periods from the Open Payments Program (OPP) database for plastic surgeons and plastic surgeon subspecialists. An analysis was performed of trends and comparison of payments for each year for all plastic surgeons and each subspecialty cohort. RESULTS: For all plastic surgeons, there was a decrease in industry payments between 2019 and 2020 (? 30.5%). All plastic surgery subspecialties had a decrease in payments with general plastic and reconstructive surgery affected the most (? 56%) and craniofacial surgery affected the least (? 9%). Payments for almost all categories for plastic surgeons decreased along with compensation as faculty or as speakers. Total charitable contributions and grant payments increased by 61 and 273%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Analysis of industryCphysician payments available through the Sunshine Act shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted industry payments to plastic surgery and its subspecialties. While this study demonstrates the economic impact of the current pandemic, only time will tell whether these trends will persist in the coming years.

Among these mutations are amino acid changes N501Y (lineage B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK), and the combination N501Y, E484K, K417N (B.1.351, first identified in South Africa), all located at the interface on the receptor binding domain (RBD). We experimentally establish that RBD containing the N501Y mutation results in 9-fold stronger binding to the hACE2 receptor than wild type RBD. The E484K mutation does not significantly influence the affinity for the receptor, while K417N attenuates affinity. As a result, RBD from B.1.351 containing all three mutations binds 3-fold stronger to hACE2 than wild type RBD but 3-fold weaker than N501Y. The recently emerging double mutant E484K/N501Y binds as tight as N501Y.

At Lbeck University, these formats consisted of web-seminars, digital learning material, home-work assignments and, from the winter semester of 2020/21 on, practice seminars in very small groups. These formats are now evaluated and adjusted for the following, still pandemic-influenced, semesters. We aim to provide adequate family medicine teaching under special circumstances. Methods Via the semester evaluations of both semesters, supplemented by questions regarding the digital teaching, we collected feedback from the students and analyzed it. Additionally, we analyzed field reports from the teachers (collected in team meetings) and data on the usage behavior of students on a family medicine knowledge platform. Results Teachers reported a mostly trouble-free realization of digital teaching. The overall rating of the semester evaluation remained unchanged when compared to the previous years figure. Most of the students perceived the digital teaching to be an adequate substitute for the traditional in-person teaching considering the circumstances. Practical aspects and personal interactions were missed the most in the summer semester of 2020 and were especially valued in the winter semester of 2020/21. The recommended knowledge platform was used actively by a high proportion of the students. Conclusions Parts of the family medicine syllabus could be taught digitally without significant problems.

Additionally, investigations of prospective predictors of mask-wearing, COVID-19 symptoms, and viral testing remain wanting. PURPOSE: The present study examined prospective relations between demographic factors, personality traits, social cognitions and guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptoms, and viral testing in a U.S. sample (N = 500) during the initial surge of COVID-19 deaths in the United State between late March and early May 2020. METHODS: Guided by a disposition-belief-motivation framework, correlational analyses, and path models tested associations among baseline personality traits, guideline adherence social cognitions, health beliefs, guideline adherence and follow-up guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptom counts, and 30-day viral testing. RESULTS: Modeling results showed greater baseline agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were associated with more frequent baseline guideline adherence. More liberal political beliefs, greater guideline adherence intentions, and more frequent guideline adherence at baseline predicted more frequent mask-wearing at follow-up. Sex (female), lower perceived health, and greater neuroticism at baseline predicted greater symptom counts at follow-up. Reports of viral testing were quite low (1.80%), yet were consistent with concurrent national reporting and limited availability of testing. CONCLUSIONS: Results show how inconsistencies and politicization of health policy communication were concomitant with the effects of individual-level political beliefs on mask-wearing during the initial surge. The results further clarify how personality traits related to social responsibility (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness) are associated with following new norms for prescribed behaviors and how symptom reporting can be as much a marker of perceived health as emotional stability.","output":"Spring 2020 COVID-19 Surge: Prospective Relations between Demographic Factors, Personality Traits, Social Cognitions and Guideline Adherence, Mask Wearing, and Symptoms in a U.S. Sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination as well as its sociodemographic and clinical determinants in a general population sample three months after the launch of the vaccination program in Switzerland. MethodsIn March 2021, an online questionnaire on vaccination acceptance was proposed to adults included in a longitudinal cohort study of previous population-based serosurveys carried out in the canton of Geneva. Questions were asked about COVID-19 vaccination acceptance, reasons of acceptance or refusal, and attitudes about vaccination in general. Data on demographic (age, sex, education, income, professional status, living conditions) and health-related characteristics (having a chronic disease, COVID-19 diagnosis, smoking status) were assessed at inclusion in the cohort (December 2020). ResultsOverall, 4067 participants (completion rate of 77.4%) responded to the survey between March 17 and April 1, 2021. The mean age of respondents was 53.3 years and 56.0% were women. Most had completed tertiary education (64.7%) and over 60% were currently professionally active. At the time of the survey, 17.2% of respondents had already been vaccinated with at least one dose or had made an appointment to get vaccinated, and an additional 58.5% intended or rather intended to get vaccinated. The overall acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination was 75.7%, with a higher acceptance among men compared to women, older adults compared to younger adults, high-income individuals compared to those with a low income, participants living in urban and semi-urban areas compared to rural, and retirees and students compared to employed individuals. Acceptance was lower among individuals having completed apprenticeships and secondary education compared to those with tertiary education. The most common reasons reported by participants intending to get vaccinated were the desire to get back to normal, to protect themselves, their community and/or society, and their relatives or friends against the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as the desire to travel. Less than half (45.6%) of participants having children were willing or rather willing to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if it were recommended by public health authorities. ConclusionAlthough our study found a 75.7% acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, there were noticeable socio-demographic disparities in vaccination acceptance. These data will be useful for public health measures targeting hesitant populations when developing health communication strategies.

The purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the hypertrophic effects of concentric vs. eccentric training in healthy adults after regimented resistance training (RT). Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental trial published in an English-language refereed journal; (b) directly compared concentric and eccentric actions without the use of external implements (i.e., blood pressure cuffs) and all other RT variables equivalent; (c) measured morphologic changes using biopsy, imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, or ultrasound), bioelectrical impedance, and/or densitometry; (d) had a minimum duration of 6 weeks; and (e) used human participants without musculoskeletal injury or any health condition that could directly, or through the medications associated with the management of said condition, be expected to impact the hypertrophic response to resistance exercise. A systematic literature search determined that 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Results showed that eccentric muscle actions resulted in a greater effect size (ES) compared with concentric actions, but results did not reach statistical significance (ES difference = 0.25  0.13; 95% confidence interval: -0.03 to 0.52; p = 0.076).

Since this diminishes immunogenicity, vaccine adjuvants that enhance the immune response to purified antigens are critically needed. Further advantages of adjuvants include dose sparing, increased vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised individuals and the potential to protect against highly variable pathogens by broadening the immune response. Due to their ability to link the innate with the adaptive immune response, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are highly promising as adjuvants in vaccines against life-threatening and complex diseases such as cancer, AIDS and malaria. TLRs are transmembrane receptors, which are predominantly expressed by innate immune cells. They can be classified into cell surface (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6) and intracellular TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9), expressed on endosomal membranes. Besides a transmembrane domain, each TLR possesses a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) segment that mediates PAMP/DAMP recognition and a TIR domain that delivers the downstream signal transduction and initiates an inflammatory response. Thus, TLRs are excellent targets for adjuvants to provide a danger signal to induce an effective immune response that leads to long-lasting protection. The present review will elaborate on applications of TLR ligands as vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents, with a focus on clinically relevant adjuvants.","output":"TLR Agonists as Vaccine Adjuvants Targeting Cancer and Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiotherapy is being performed in many situations as a curative approach for head and neck cancer instead of surgery due to the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

However, there is no particular designed drug for COVID-19 up to this point. Thus, there exist three strategies for COVID-19 drug design;drug repurposing option, herbal medicine development, and transcriptomics-based drug lead. As the most underutilized option, transcriptomics-based drug lead could be leveraged to deal with SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of the main methods to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection is to inhibit the RNA polymerase enzyme that is responsible to the viral replication. In this regard, the objective of the strategy is to design the anti-sense siRNA drug and lead to inhibit the mRNA of the RNA Polymerase Enzyme (RdRp) gene that encodes the viral RNA Polymerase of the SARS-CoV-2. The Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD)-based method was leveraged with sequence retrieval of 24 RdRp gene sequences, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree reconstruction, 2D/3D RNA structure predictions, and RNA-RNA docking. Both the RNAalifold conserved structure from the RdRp genes and the RNAfold structure of the siRNA for blocking the conserved structure are negative or less than 0 kcal/mol. The predicted RNA docking occurred with the best RMSD score of 22.53 ?, which is beyond the accepted threshold of 10-20 ?.

Ten traditional and novel vaccines have been listed by the World Health Organization for emergency use. Additional alternative approaches may better address ongoing vaccination globally, where there remains an inequity in vaccine distribution. GBP510 is a recombinant protein vaccine, which consists of self-assembling, two-component nanoparticles displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array. MethodsWe conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GBP510 (2-doses at a 28-day interval) adjuvanted with or without AS03 in adults aged 19-85 years. The main outcomes included solicited and unsolicited adverse events; anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody responses; T-cell immune responses. FindingsOf 328 participants who underwent randomization, 327 participants received at least 1 dose of vaccine. Each received either 10 g GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 (n = 101), 10 g unadjuvanted GBP510 (n = 10), 25 g GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 (n = 104), 25 g unadjuvanted GBP510 (n = 51), or placebo (n = 61). Most solicited adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity and transient. Higher reactogenicity was observed in the GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 groups compared to the non-adjuvanted and placebo groups. Reactogenicity was higher post-dose 2 compared to post-dose 1, particularly for systemic adverse events. The geometric mean concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG antibody reached 2163.6/2599.2 BAU/mL in GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 recipients (10 g/25 g) by 14 days after the second dose. Two-dose vaccination with 10 g or 25 g GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 induced high titers of neutralizing antibody via pseudovirus (1369.0/1431.5 IU/mL) and wild-type virus (949.8/861.0 IU/mL) assays.

Solicited adverse events were more frequent and more severe in intensity after the first dose compared to the second dose for adenovirus-vectored vaccines, whereas they increased after the second dose of mRNA or recombinant spike-protein nanoparticle vaccines. Added value of this studyThis is the first human study evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein nanoparticle with and without adjuvant AS03, designed to elicit functional cross-protective responses via receptor-binding domain (RBD). Both 10 and 25 g of GBP510 with AS03 formulations were well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Potent humoral immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were induced and peaked by day 42 (14 days after the second dose). In addition, GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 elicited a noticeable Th1 response, with production of IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, and IL-2. IL-4 was inconsistent and IL-5 nearly inexistent response across all groups. Implications of the available evidenceThe results from this phase 1/2 trial indicate that GBP510 adjuvanted with AS03 has an acceptable safety profile with no vaccine-related serious adverse events.

COVID-19 pathophysiology involves the activation of three main pathways: the inflammatory, the coagulation and the bradykinin cascades. Here, we highlight for the first time the joint potential therapeutic role of bromelain and curcumin, two well-known nutraceuticals, in the prevention of severe COVID-19. Bromelain (a cysteine protease isolated from the pineapple stem) and curcumin (a natural phenol found in turmeric) exert important immunomodulatory actions interfering in the crucial steps of COVID-19 pathophysiology. Their anti-inflammatory properties include inhibition of transcription factors and subsequent downregulation of proinflammatory mediators. They also present fibrinolytic and anticoagulant properties. Additionally, bromelain inhibits cyclooxygenase and modulates prostaglandins and thromboxane, affecting both inflammation and coagulation, and also hydrolyzes bradykinin. Interestingly, curcumin has been shown in in silico studies to prevent entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells as well as viral replication, while a recent experimental study has demonstrated that bromelain may also inhibit viral entry into cells. Notably, bromelain substantially increases the absorption of curcumin after oral administration.

We aimed to cluster chronic pain patients into distinct subgroups based on psychosocial characteristics and pain intensity, and subsequently examined group differences in pain-related interference approximately one year later. METHODS In this observational, longitudinal study, patients with chronic pain (N = 94) completed validated assessments of psychosocial characteristics and pain intensity at the beginning of COVID-related social distancing (April-June, 2020). One year later (May-June, 2021), patients completed a follow-up survey with assessments of pain interference, loneliness, social support, mindfulness, and optimism. RESULTS A cluster analysis, using psychosocial factors and pain intensity, empirically produced three patient groups: 1) PsychoSocial Predominant (PSP), characterized by high psychosocial distress and average pain intensity; 2) Pain Intensity Predominant (PIP), characterized by average psychosocial distress and high pain intensity; and 3) Less Elevated Symptoms (LES), characterized by low psychosocial distress and low pain intensity. At the 1-year follow-up, patients in the PSP and PIP clusters suffered greater pain interference compared to the LES cluster, while the PSP cluster also reported greater loneliness, and lower mindfulness and optimism. CONCLUSIONS An empiric psychosocial-based clustering of patients identified three distinct groups, which differed in pain interference. Patients with high psychosocial modulation of pain at the onset of social distancing (PSP cluster) suffered not only greater pain interference, but also greater loneliness and lower levels of mindfulness and optimism, suggesting some potential behavioral targets for this group in the future.","output":"Profiles of Risk and Resilience in Chronic Pain: Loneliness, Social Support, Mindfulness, and Optimism Coming out of the First Pandemic Year."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors report a case of the safe performance of radiofrequency (RF) ablations and biopsies in a patient with metastatic pheochromocytoma.

In spite of this, inequalities remain and many would argue that these have been exacerbated during the Covid pandemic. Understanding Higher Education responds to these calls by arguing for a social account of teaching and learning by contesting dominant understandings of students as decontextualised learners premised on the idea that the university is a meritocracy. This book tackles the issue of teaching and learning by looking both within and beyond the classroom. It looks at how higher education policies emerged from the notion of the knowledge economy in the newly democratic South Africa, and how national qualification frameworks and other processes brought the country more closely into conversation with the global order. The effects of this on staffing and curriculum structures are considered alongside a proposition for alternative ways of understanding the role of higher education in society.","output":"Understanding higher education: alternative perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens leads to poor patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs). Contact precautions are necessary to reduce the transmission of MDR pathogens. However, the importance of the surrounding environment is not well known. We studied the effects of ICU relocation on MDR respiratory pathogen detection rates and patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients admitted to the ICU before and after the relocation were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics, types of respiratory pathogens detected, antibiotics used, and patient outcomes were measured. RESULTS: A total of 463 adult patients admitted to the ICU, 4 months before and after the relocation, were included. Of them, 234 were admitted to the ICU before the relocation and 229 afterward. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, and underlying comorbidities, did not differ between the two groups. After the relocation, the incidence rate of MDR respiratory pathogen detection decreased from 90.0 to 68.8 cases per 1,000 patient-days, but that difference was statistically insignificant. The use of colistin was significantly reduced from 53.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.3 to 86.7 days) to 18.7 days (95% CI, 5.6 to 31.7 days). Furthermore, the duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced from a median of 29 days (interquartile range [IQR], 14 to 50 days) to 21 days (IQR, 11 to 39 days).

There was a 9% absolute decrease in discharges to an IRF during the pandemic (32.1% vs. 41.1%, p=0.04), which translated to 38% lower odds of being discharged to IRF versus home in unadjusted regression (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92, p=0.016). The lower odds of discharge to IRF persisted in the multivariable model (aOR 0.16, 95%CI 0.09-0.31, p<0.001) despite a significant increase in discharge disability (median discharge mRS 4 [IQR 2-4] vs. 2 [IQR 1-3], p<0.001) during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Admission for stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significantly lower probability of being discharged to an IRF. This effect persisted despite adjustment for predictors of IRF disposition, including functional disability at discharge. Potential reasons for this disparity are explored.","output":"Decline in Rehab Transfers Among Rehab-Eligible Stroke Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aims of the present study were to obtain sleep quality and sleep timing information in a group of university students and to evaluate the effects of a circadian hygiene education initiative. All students of the University of Padova (approximately 64,000) were contacted by e-mail (major campaigns in October 2019 and October 2020) and directed to an ad hoc website for collection of demographics and sleep quality/timing information. Participants (n = 5,740) received one of two sets of circadian hygiene advice (A regular life or Bright days and dark nights). Every month, they were then asked how easy it had been to comply and provided with the advice again. At any even month from joining, they completed the sleep quality/timing questionnaires again. Information on academic performance was obtained post hoc, together with representative samples of lecture (n = 5,972) and examination (n = 1,800) timings, plus lecture attendances (n = 25,302). Fifty-two percent of students had poor sleep quality, and 82% showed signs of social jetlag. Those who joined in October 2020, after several months of lockdown and distance learning, had better sleep quality, less social jetlag, and later sleep habits. Over approximately a year, the Bright days and dark nights advice resulted in significantly earlier get-up times compared with the A regular life advice. Similarly, it also resulted in a trend toward earlier midsleep (i.e., the midpoint, expressed as clock time, between sleep onset and sleep offset) and toward a decrease in the latency between wake-up and get-up time, with no impact on sleep duration. Significant changes in most sleep quality and sleep timing variables (i.e., fewer night awakenings, less social jetlag, and delayed sleep timing during lock-down) were observed in both advice groups over approximately a year, mostly in association with pandemic-related events characterizing 2020. Early chronotype students had better academic performances compared with their later chronotype counterparts. In a multivariate model, sleep quality, chronotype and study subject (science and technology, health and medical, or social and humanities) were independent predictors of academic performance. Taken together, these results underlie the importance of designing circadian-friendly university timetables.","output":"A Circadian Hygiene Education Initiative Covering the Pre-pandemic and Pandemic Period Resulted in Earlier Get-Up Times in Italian University Students: An Ecological Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As India is fighting against the second wave of COVID-19, Healthcare professionals are the front-line warriors on that battlefield which puts them under psychological pressure, this systematic review aims to critically look into and amalgamate the evidence on impact of COVID-19 on psychological health of healthcare professionals in India and to seek the attention of policymakers.

Disease modellers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for the classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a dual speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like [Formula: see text] [ 1], and show that we can measure the strength and speed of an intervention on the same scale as the strength and speed of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, while the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of test-and-treat interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We also discuss evaluating the effects of the importance of pre-symptomatic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

We sought to study all possible complications of COVID-19 to confirm previously reported complications and to identify potential complications not yet known. METHODS: Using United States health claims data, we compared the frequency of all International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes occurring before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in an exposure-crossover design. We included patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 between Mar. 1, 2020, and Apr. 30, 2020, and computed risk estimates and odds ratios (ORs) of association with COVID-19 for every ICD-10-CM diagnosis code. RESULTS: Among 70 288 patients with COVID-19, 69 of 1724 analyzed ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes were significantly associated with COVID-19. Disorders showing both strong association with COVID-19 and high absolute risk included viral pneumonia (OR 177.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 147.19-214.37, absolute risk 27.6%), respiratory failure (OR 11.36, 95% CI 10.74-12.02, absolute risk 22.6%), acute kidney failure (OR 3.50, 95% CI 3.34-3.68, absolute risk 11.8%) and sepsis (OR 4.23, 95% CI 4.01-4.46, absolute risk 10.4%).

The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes of Qatar University employees and students towards the COVID-19 vaccine. In total, 231 employees and 231 students participated in an online cross-sectional study in February 2021. Of the sample, 62.6% were willing to take a vaccine against COVID-19. Participants with or taking postgraduate degrees were more willing to take the vaccine compared to participants with or taking a diploma or bachelors degree (p < 0.001). Males had a higher rate of vaccine acceptance (p < 0.001). In the group that regarded flu vaccination as important, 13% were unwilling to take COVID-19 vaccine. There were no associations between willingness to vaccinate and vaccine/virus knowledge and social media use.

STUDY AIMS: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, threat perception, illness representations. METHODS: Cross-sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used, for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. RESULTS: A total of 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, from all levels of area deprivation (i.e., 3.8% in the most deprived decile and 15.6% in the most affluent decile). Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exacerbated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the results of pre-Covid-19 pandemic studies about associations between sociodemographics and mental health.

One factor that is being explored throughout patient care is the idea of diet and the role it has on patient outcomes. But the effects of diet following neurotrauma need to be carefully explored in animal models to ensure that they have beneficial effects. The ketogenic diet provides sufficient daily caloric requirements while being potentially neuroprotective and analgesic. In this study, animals were fed a high fat, low carbohydrate diet that led to a high concentration of blood ketone levels that was sustained for as long as the animals were on the diet. Mice fed a ketogenic diet had significantly lower levels of tyrosine and tryptophan but the levels of other monoamines within the spinal cord remained similar to control mice. Mice were fed a standard or ketogenic diet for 7 days before, and 28 days following the injury. Our results show that mice hemisected over the T10-11 vertebrae showed no beneficial effects of being on a ketogenic diet over a 28 day recovery period. Similarly, ligation of the common peroneal and tibial nerve showed no differences between mice fed normal or ketogenic diets. Tests included von Frey, open field, and ladder-rung crossing. We add to existing literature showing protective effects of the ketogenic diet in forelimb injuries by focusing on neurotrauma in the hindlimbs. The results suggest that ketogenic diets need to be assessed based on the type and location of neurotrauma.Significance Statement There is an urgent need for therapeutics to improve outcomes for patients with neurotrauma. Here we test the effects of a non-invasive diet-based therapy. Ketogenic diets, which are high fat and low carbohydrate-based, have been shown to be effective in treating epilepsy, Parkinson's Disease, and show promise for treating other neurotrauma and neurodegenerative conditions. Here we show that while we were successful in producing high ketone concentrations in mice, the effects on recovery of function and pain following a thoracic spinal cord hemisection or spared nerve injury were minimal. Therefore, ketogenic diets, while effective in certain cases, should be evaluated depending on the injury type.","output":"The effects of a ketogenic diet on sensorimotor function in a thoracolumbar mouse spinal cord injury model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vasospasm, initial neurological damage, rebleeding, and periprocedural complications are associated prognostic factors for clinical outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In this study, factors related to delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) are evaluated using data from our institute for the last 18 years. Data from 2001 to 2018 of patients with aneurysmal SAH who underwent surgical clipping (SC) or endovascular coiling (EC) within 7 days of onset were retrospectively analyzed. Cases of mortality within 5 days after treatment were excluded. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the risk factors for DIND. In total, 840 cases of SAH were assessed; among these cases, 384 (45.7%) and 456 (54.3%) were treated with SC and EC, respectively. The frequency of DIND in the EC group was significantly less than that in the SC group (11.8% vs. 17.7%; p = 0.016). In the results of multivariate analysis, internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm and hemorrhagic complications were the risk factors for DIND. Cilostazol administration and EC were significant factors for vasospasm prevention after aneurysmal SAH (odds ratio of ICA aneurysm: 1.59, hemorrhagic complications: 1.76, SC: 1.51, and cilostazol administration: 0.51, respectively). Cilostazol administration was also a significant factor in patients who were treated with EC. ICA aneurysm, treatment strategy, hemorrhagic complications, and cilostazol administration were associated with DIND. Oral administration of cilostazol and avoiding hemorrhagic complications were effective in DIND prevention.

Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element of high importance for human health and particularly for a well-balanced immune response. The mortality risk from a severe disease like sepsis or polytrauma is inversely related to Se status. We hypothesized that this relation also applies to COVID-19. Serum samples (n = 166) from COVID-19 patients (n = 33) were collected consecutively and analyzed for total Se by X-ray fluorescence and selenoprotein P (SELENOP) by a validated ELISA. Both biomarkers showed the expected strong correlation (r = 0.7758, p < 0.001), pointing to an insufficient Se availability for optimal selenoprotein expression. In comparison with reference data from a European cross-sectional analysis (EPIC, n = 1915), the patients showed a pronounced deficit in total serum Se (mean  SD, 50.8  15.7 vs. 84.4  23.4 g/L) and SELENOP (3.0  1.4 vs. 4.3  1.0 mg/L) concentrations. A Se status below the 2.5th percentile of the reference population, i.e., [Se] < 45.7 g/L and [SELENOP] < 2.56 mg/L, was present in 43.4% and 39.2% of COVID samples, respectively.

Material and Methods A total of thirty male (n=16) and female (n=14) volunteers (mean age and BMI of 32 +/- 1.07 years and 25.1 +/- 0.68 kg/m(2), respectively) completed the protocol. This was a multiple cross-over trial for healthy volunteers. All participants took a one-hour brisk walking with and without a surgical face mask. Specific physiological measurements (HR - heart rate;BP - blood pressure, SaO(2) - arterial oxygen content) were compared before and immediately after two brisk walking. Each subject served their own control. Results The evaluation found that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean HR and blood pressure values during the brisk walking with and without a surgical face mask, while there was a statistically significant difference in the SaO(2) values on behalf of no-mask-walking (p<0.05). Conclusions: The use of surgical face masks in healthy volunteers causes a decrease in SaO(2) during brisk walking. However, it does not affect the mean pulse rate and blood pressure. Although there was a statistically significant decrease in the SaO(2) parameter during mask-walking, it is possible to state that brisk walking with a surgical face mask does not have a physiologically negative impact, because this decrease is in ranges that are accepted to be normal.","output":"Physiological impact of wearing a surgical face mask during walking in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected all aspects of life and poses a severe threat to human health and economic development. New York City administration enacted a strict isolation decision at the end of March 2020 to tackle the COVID-19, creating a unique opportunity to assess air quality. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the lockdown on air quality in New York City. We evaluated the air pollutants concentration, i.e., PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3, during the lockdown and compared them with pre-COVID-19. We explored the first phase of lockdown through a spatial approach, then formulated the air quality index (AQI) of each pollutant before and during the lockdown. Our findings revealed that (1) there was a significant decline in the concentration level of PM2.5 from 10.3 to 4.0 g/m3 during phase one of lockdown. (2) NO2 concentrations have been decreased by up to 52% in 1st phase of lockdown. (3) O3 concentration has been increased by 44.4%. (4) Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island County encountered 18.75%, 55.62%, 47.14%, and 47% diminution in AQI due to lockdown as compared to 2018, respectively.

As prescribing habits and locally available medications vary considerably between countries, guides tailored to the needs of specific regions may be required. We aimed to report the results of the international Delphi validation study for the Turkish Inappropriate Medication use in the Elderly (TIME) criteria set, which aims to detect inappropriate prescribing in older adults in Eastern Europe. METHODS: The study was conducted between June 2019 and March 2020. Delphi rounds were conducted by the TIME international working group, which included 11 internationally recognized experts in geriatric pharmacotherapy as Delphi panelists. They were asked to indicate to what extent they agreed or disagreed with each TIME criterion, taking into account both the available evidence and their own experience. We used a five-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) and an online software program (SurveyMonkey(?)) to grade the level of agreement. Criteria with a median value of 1 or 2 and a 75th centile value of 1 or 2 were accepted, and criteria with a median value > 2 were rejected. Those with a median value of 1 or 2 but a 75th centile value > 2 were retained, to be assessed in the following round. The initial list of Delphi criteria comprised 153 TIME items. RESULTS: After three Delphi rounds, 134 criteria were accepted and seven criteria were rejected, while 12 criteria did not achieve consensus, and so were not included in the final validated set of TIME criteria. CONCLUSION: We developed the internationally validated TIME criteria set based on a Delphi process involving international experts. The validation study suggests that the TIME criteria set can be applied in both central and Eastern European settings. Further studies are needed to assess the utility and benefit of the TIME criteria in reducing inappropriate drug use and improving clinical outcomes.

This review is focused on current knowledge about the activation and regulation of chemoattractant receptors. Emphasis is placed on the members of the N-formyl peptide receptor family, namely FPR (N-formyl peptide receptor), FPRL1 (FPR like-1) and FPRL2 (FPR like-2), and the complement fragment C5a receptors (C5aR and C5L2). Upon chemoattractant binding, the receptors transduce an activation signal through a G protein-dependent pathway, leading to biochemical responses that contribute to physiological defense against bacterial infection and tissue damage. C5aR, and the members of the FPR family that were previously thought to be restricted to phagocytes proved to have a much broader spectrum of cell expression. In addition to N-formylated peptides, numerous unrelated ligands were recently found to interact with FPR and FPRL1. Novel agonists include both pathogen- and host-derived components, and synthetic peptides. Antagonistic molecules have been identified that exhibit limited receptor specificity. How distinct ligands can both induce different biological responses and produce different modes of receptor activation and unique sets of cellular responses are discussed. Cell responses to chemoattractants are tightly regulated at the level of the receptors. This review describes in detail the regulation of receptor signalling and the multi-step process of receptor inactivation. New concepts, such as receptor oligomerization and receptor clustering, are considered. Although FPR, FPRL1 and C5aR trigger similar biological functions and undergo a rapid chemoattractant-mediated phosphorylation, they appear to be differentially regulated and experience different intracellular fates.","output":"The N-formyl peptide receptors and the anaphylatoxin C5a receptors: An overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ticks and tick-borne diseases such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever pose a significant threat to animal and human health. Tick-borne diseases cause billions of dollars of losses to livestock farmers annually. These losses are partially attributed to the lack of sensitive, robust, cost effective and efficient diagnostic approaches that could detect the infectious pathogen at the early stages of illness. The modern nucleic acid-based multiplex diagnostic approaches have been developed in human medicine but are still absent in veterinary medicine. These powerful assays can screen 384 patient samples at one time, simultaneously detect numerous infectious pathogens in each test sample and provide the diagnostic answer in a few hours. Development, commercialization, and wide use of such high throughput multiplex molecular assays in the cattle tick-borne disease surveillance will help in early detection and control of infectious pathogens in the animal reservoir before community spread and spillover to humans. Such approaches in veterinary medicine will save animal life, prevent billions of dollars of economic loss to cattle herders and reduce unwanted stress to both human and animal health care systems.

This investigation proposed a one-dimensional analytical model that can predict the longitudinal transmission of airborne contaminants or disease viruses inside an airliner cabin. The model considered both diffusive and convective transport of contaminants in the longitudinal direction of the cabin but assumed complete mixing of contaminants in the cabin cross-section. The effect of recirculation of the cabin air and efficiency of the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters is also considered in the model. The analytical solution for the one-dimensional contaminant transport model is obtained by using the principle of superposition and the method of separation of variables. The analytical solutions agree well with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results. The coupling of a CFD model with the one-dimensional analytical model could capture the impact of local airflow on contaminant transport. This analytical model has been used for analyzing contaminant transport in a 30-row all-economy-class airliner cabin with minimal computing effort. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The paper presents a new one-dimensional analytical model that can provide quick information on global airborne contaminant transmissions in airliner cabins for effective response plans. The model can be used to study the effects of air exchange rates, recirculation, efficiency of the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and longitudinal airflow on airborne contaminant transport in airliner cabins with minimal computing effort.","output":"A one-dimensional analytical model for airborne contaminant transport in airliner cabins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On Dec 17, 2020 of last year, I woke up with a tickle in my throat Later it became a cough I took cough syrup By the weekend, I had cold-like symptoms and began taking medicine for cold and flu On Monday I was nauseated;I took Pepto-Bismol I lay on the couch getting sicker and sicker I tried to drink juice or ginger ale, but could keep nothing down I canceled Christmas dinner with my son and his family By Christmas Day, I'd lost 15 pounds","output":"Learn from the leadership of the COVID-19 healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) heavily relies on universal access to testing to identify who is infected; tracking them to make sure they do not spread the disease further; and tracing those with whom they have been in contact.

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is one of the main barriers which avoids the theoretical observations to be accomplished in practice. In this study, we have utilized various kinds of filtering operators against three various noises, which are the signal-to-noise ratio comparison against the phantom image in spatial and frequency domain. In frequency domain, the average filter is used to smooth the image and frequency domain, and Gaussian low-pass filter is applied with empirically determined cutoff frequency. This work has six major parts such as applying average filter, determining the SNR of region of interest, transforming the image in frequency domain by discrete Fourier transform, obtaining the rectangular Gaussian low-pass filter along with a cutoff frequency, multiplying them, and carrying out the inverse Fourier transform. These steps are repeated accordingly until the resulting image SNR is equal to or greater than the spatial domain SNR. In order to achieve the goal of this study, we have analyzed the proposed approach against some of complex phantom images.

We test the hypothesis that listeners with hearing loss' difficulties with comprehension and processing of syntactically complex sentences are due to the processing of degraded input interfering with the successful processing of complex sentences. Method We performed a neuroimaging study with a sentence comprehension task, varying sentence complexity (through subject-object order and verb-arguments order) and cognitive demands (presence or absence of a secondary task) within subjects. Groups of older subjects with hearing loss (n = 20) and age-matched normal-hearing controls (n = 20) were tested. Results The comprehension data show effects of syntactic complexity and hearing ability, with normal-hearing controls outperforming listeners with hearing loss, seemingly more so on syntactically complex sentences. The secondary task did not influence off-line comprehension. The imaging data show effects of group, sentence complexity, and task, with listeners with hearing loss showing decreased activation in typical speech processing areas, such as the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. No interactions between group, sentence complexity, and task were found in the neuroimaging data. Conclusions The results suggest that listeners with hearing loss process speech differently from their normal-hearing peers, possibly due to the increased demands of processing degraded auditory input. Increased cognitive demands by means of a secondary visual shape processing task influence neural sentence processing, but no evidence was found that it does so in a different way for listeners with hearing loss and normal-hearing listeners.","output":"When Hearing Does Not Mean Understanding: On the Neural Processing of Syntactically Complex Sentences by Listeners With Hearing Loss."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has strongly affected individuals and societies worldwide.

It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta, corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh), a serotonin transporter (Slc6a4), and a microglia maker (Aif1) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Lots of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential.

We evaluated children presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine if the likelihood of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test differed between participants with one versus 2 symptoms, and to examine the predictive capability of isolated symptoms. METHODS: Participants  18 years presenting for clinical SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing in six sites in urban/suburban/rural Georgia (July-October, 2021; delta variant predominant) were queried about individual symptoms. Participants were classified into three groups: asymptomatic, one symptom only, or 2 symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 test results and clinical characteristics of the three groups were compared. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) for isolated symptoms were calculated by fitting a saturated Poisson model. RESULTS: Of 602 participants, 21.8% tested positive and 48.7% had a known or suspected close contact. Children reporting one symptom (n=82; OR=6.00, 95% CI: 2.70-13.33) and children reporting 2 symptoms (n=365; OR=5.25: 2.66-10.38) were significantly more likely to have a positive COVID-19 test than asymptomatic children (n=155), but they were not significantly different from each other (OR=0.88: 0.52-1.49).

Without comprehensive protection, during a severe hospital outbreak in the Peking University People's Hospital (PKUPH), there were 78 patients diagnosed with SARS and two deaths. During treatment, most patients received large doses of steroid shock therapy, which may result in complications of femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We aimed to follow up the condition of lung and bone in those patients. Methods We did an observational cohort study of patients with SARS from 2003 to 2018. We carried out pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI tests, pulmonary function tests, and hip joint functional assessment to evaluate the recovery condition of lung damage and femoral head necrosis according to patients' willingness. We used linear regression, and mixed-model repeated-measures analysis to measure the change of lung interstitial and femoral head necrosis volume. This study was authorised by the Ethics Committee of Peking University People's Hospital (2018PHB010-01). All recruited SARS patients signed informed consent for the study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03443102. Findings There were 80 medical staff patients with SARS altogether in Peking University People's Hospital. Two patients died of SARS in 2003 and 78 patients were enrolled in this study from August, 2003, to March, 2018. 71 patients completed the 15 years' follow-up and seven patients were missing. Pulmonary injury scope on lung CT improved from 2003 (940%, SD 783) to 2004 (320%, 478; p0001), and thereafter remained steady to 2018 (460%, 637). Pulmonary function items in patients with SARS did not differ between 2006 and 2018. The recovery extent of pulmonary function items between 2006 and 2018 in patients with lung interstitial change (n=13), was less than that without lung interstitial changes (n=23), especially in one-second ratio (FEV1/FVC, t=221, p=004) and mid-flow of maximum expiration (FEF25C75%, t=276, p=001). The volume of femoral head necrosis decreased significantly from 2003 (3883%, SD 2101) to 2005 (3038%, 2023; p=00002), then decreased slowly from 2005 to 2013 (2899%, 2059) and thereafter remained steady to 2018 (2552%, 1551)%. Interpretation Damaged lung interstitial and functional decline induced by SARS mainly recovered in the next 1C2 years after rehabilitation.

Conservation management programmes for the chimpanzee have been established outside their natural range (ex situ), and chimpanzees from these programmes could potentially be used to supplement future conservation initiatives in the wild (in situ). However, these programmes have often suffered from inadequate information about the geographical origin and subspecies ancestry of the founders. Here, we present a newly designed capture array with ~60,000 ancestry informative markers used to infer ancestry of individual chimpanzees in ex situ populations and determine geographical origin of confiscated sanctuary individuals. From a test panel of 167 chimpanzees with unknown origins or subspecies labels, we identify 90 suitable non-admixed individuals in the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) Ex situ Programme (EEP).

Amidst this increased visibility, the role is deeply contested. Much of the disagreement concerns whether CMOs should act independently of the government: while some argue CMOs should act as independent voices who work to shape government policy to protect public health, others stress that CMOs are civil servants whose job is to support the government. The scope and diversity of debates about the CMO role can be explained by its inherently contradictory nature, which requires incumbents to balance their commitments as physicians with their mandates as civil servants who advise and speak on the governments behalf. The long-haul COVID-19 pandemic has further tested the CMO role and has shone light on its varying remits and expectations across different jurisdictions, institutions and contexts. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that calls to amend the CMO role have emerged in some jurisdictions during the pandemic. However, any discussions about changing the CMO role need a stronger understanding of how different institutional and individual approaches impact what incumbents feel able to do, say and achieve. Based on an ongoing comparative analysis of the position across five countries with Westminster-style political systems, we provide an overview of the CMO role, explain its prominence in a pandemic, examine some debates surrounding the role and discuss a few unanswered empirical questions before describing our ongoing study in greater detail.","output":"Under the spotlight: understanding the role of the Chief Medical Officer in a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 telah menyebabkan dampak signifikan pada berbagai tatanan kehidupan bermasyarakat.

Debate remains, however, how can we best define changes in syringomyelia following surgery. OBJECTIVE: To introduce a grading system focusing on syrinx reduction based on routinely and reproducible radiological information, and provide a suggestion of the application of this scale for prediction of patient's prognoses. METHODS: Data from 48 patients with Chiari malformation and syringomyelia were compiled. We calculated syrinx cross-sectional area by approximating an ellipse in the largest axial plane. We compared the percentage of reduction or enlargement following surgery. The percentage change was grouped into four grades: Grade 0 = Increasing size, grade I &#8804; 50% reduction, grade II = 50% to 90% reduction, grade III &#8805; 90% reduction. RESULTS: A total of 89.6% of patients had syrinx improvement after surgery. A total of 5 patients were grade 0, 14 were grade I, 20 patients were grade II, and 9 patients met criteria for grade III. The mean postoperative syrinx area was 24.1 mm2 (0-169 mm2) with a mean syrinx reduction of 62.7%.

This study examined medical teachers experience with emergency remote teaching during the pandemic and their acceptance of online teaching after the pandemic. METHODS: In this sequential mixed methods study, online surveys were disseminated to teachers (n = 139) at two AsiaCPacific medical schools to evaluate their experience with emergency remote teaching during the pandemic. Subsequently, in-depth interviews were conducted with teachers from both institutions (n = 13). Each interviewee was classified into an adopter category based on Rogers Diffusion of Innovations Theory. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically, and the descriptive themes were mapped to broader themes partly based on the Technology Acceptance Model and these included: (i) perceived usefulness of online teaching, (ii) perceived ease of delivering online teaching, (iii) experience with institutional support and (iv) acceptance of online teaching after the pandemic. RESULTS: Our participants described accounts of successes with their emergency remote teaching and difficulties they experienced. In general, most participants found it difficult to deliver clinical skills teaching remotely and manage large groups of students in synchronous online classes. With regards to institutional support, teachers with lower technological literacy required just-in-time technical support, while teachers who were innovative in their online teaching practices found that IT support alone could not fully address their needs. It was also found that teachers acceptance of online teaching after the pandemic was influenced by their belief about the usefulness of online teaching. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that our participants managed to adapt to emergency remote teaching during this pandemic, and it also identified a myriad of drivers and blockers to online teaching adoption for medical teachers.

A predefined secondary analysis was to examine factors associated with mortality. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 935 Patients were included. In-hospital mortality was 21%. Compared to patients who died, patients who survived had a lower risk of ARDS according to the Lung Injury Prediction Score and received lower maximum airway pressure (P(max)), driving pressure (P), positive end-expiratory pressure, and FiO(2) levels. Tidal volume size was similar between the groups. Higher P(max) was a potentially modifiable ventilatory variable associated with in-hospital mortality in multivariable analyses. P was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality, but reliable values for P were available for 343 patients only. Non-modifiable factors associated with in-hospital mortality were older age, presence of immunosuppression, higher non-pulmonary sequential organ failure assessment scores, lower pulse oximetry readings, higher heart rates, and functional dependence.

Household chaos may act upon maternal behaviors of physical activity and sleep, potentially via higher stress. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationships among household chaos, maternal stress, and maternal physical activity and sleep, and identify barriers to home organization during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online survey of 1721 mothers of preschoolers (ages = 3.0-5.9 years) in the United States was conducted in May 2020 during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and early reopening. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, stress, physical activity and sleep, and barriers to home organization during the outbreak. Mediation models were conducted among household chaos, stress, and physical activity and sleep with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: About half of mothers were middle income (48.2%), employed full-time prior to the outbreak (59.1%), and met the physical activity (47.7%), and sleep guideline (49.7%, 7-9 h/day). Household chaos and stress were both negatively related to physical activity and sleep. For every 1 unit increase in mother's current stress, mothers were 11% (95% confidence interval = 6% to 16%) less likely to meet the physical activity guideline and 19% (95% confidence interval = 14% to 23%) less likely to meet the sleep guideline. Household chaos was positively related to stress. Stress partially mediated the relationship between household chaos and physical activity and sleep. Virus concerns, occupational changes (i.e. teleworking), and lack of childcare were barriers to home organization.

However, no study has evaluated whether the actual implementation of life-sustaining treatment has decreased after the enforcement of this law. This study aimed to compare the provision of patient consent before and after the enforcement of this law among cancer patients who visited a tertiary university hospital's emergency room to understand the effects of this law on the clinical care of cancer patients. METHODS: This retrospective single cohort study included advanced cancer patients aged over 19 years who visited the emergency room of a tertiary university hospital. The two study periods were as follows: from February 2017 to January 2018 (before) and from May 2018 to April 2019 (after). The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay. The consent rates to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intubation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The length of hospital stay decreased after the law was enforced from 4 to 2 days (p = 0.001). The rates of direct transfers to secondary hospitals and nursing hospitals increased from 8.2 to 21.2% (p = 0.001) and from 1.0 to 9.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). The consent rate for admission to the ICU decreased from 6.7 to 2.3% (p = 0.032). For CPR and CRRT, the consent rates decreased from 1.0 to 0.0% and from 13.9 to 8.8%, respectively, but the differences were not significant (p = 0.226 and p = 0.109, respectively). CONCLUSION: After the enforcement of the Life Extension Medical Decision law, the length of stay in the tertiary university hospital decreased in patients who established their life-sustaining treatment plans in the emergency room.

Ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), P/F, is currently used as a marker of ARF severity in Covid-19. P/F does not reflect the respiratory efforts made by patients to maintain arterial blood oxygenation, such as tachypnea and hyperpnea, leading to hypocapnia. Standard PaO2, the value of PaO2 adjusted for arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of the subject, better reflects the pathophysiology of hypoxemic ARF. We hypothesized that the ratio between standard PaO2 over FiO2 (STP/F) better predicts Covid-19 ARF severity compared to P/F. METHODS: Aim of this pilot prospectic observational study was to observe differences between STP/F and P/F in predicting outcome failure, defined as need of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or deaths in Covid-19 ARF. Accuracy was calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis and areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) were compared. RESULTS: 349 consecutive subjects admitted to our respiratory wards due to Covid-19 ARF were enrolled. STP/F was accurate to predict mortality and superior to P/F with, respectively, AUROC 0.710 versus 0.688, p = 0.012.Both STP/F and PF were accurate to predict outcome failure (AUROC respectively of 0.747 and 0.742, p = 0.590).

Using a panel of 37 convalescent COVID-19 human serum samples, we showed that the magnitude and specificity of responses varied across individuals, independent of their reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs). These data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines will elicit primary humoral immune responses in na?ve individuals and variable responses in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unlike the limited cross-coronavirus reactivities in humans, serum samples from 96 dogs and 10 cats showed SARS-CoV-2 protein-specific responses focused on non-S1 proteins. The correlation of this response with those to other coronaviruses suggests that the antibodies are cross-reactive and generated to endemic viruses within these hosts, which must be considered in seroepidemiologic studies.

The understanding of fundamental aspects of this virus is of extreme importance. In this work, we studied the viral ribonuclease nsp14, one of the most interferon antagonists from SARS-CoV-2. Nsp14 is a multifunctional protein with two distinct activities, an N-terminal 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), both critical for coronaviruses life cycle, indicating nsp14 as a prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs. In coronaviruses, nsp14 ExoN activity is stimulated through the interaction with the nsp10 protein. We have performed a biochemical characterization of nsp14-nsp10 complex from SARS-CoV-2. We confirm the 3'-5' exoribonuclease and MTase activities of nsp14 and the critical role of nsp10 in upregulating the nsp14 ExoN activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 N7-MTase activity is functionally independent of the ExoN activity and nsp10. A model from SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex allowed mapping key nsp10 residues involved in this interaction. Our results show that a stable interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is required for the nsp14-mediated ExoN activity of SARS-CoV-2. We studied the role of conserved DEDD catalytic residues of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN. Our results show that motif I of ExoN domain is essential for the nsp14 function, contrasting to the functionality of these residues in other coronaviruses, which can have important implications regarding the specific pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

Design: Prospective, open cohort study following participants from 2016 to 2019. We conducted analyses in a self-matched framework, comparing outcomes during participants' follow-up periods before and after receipt of PCV13. Setting: Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) integrated healthcare delivery system. Participants: Adults aged []65 years who received PCV13 between 2016-2019. Exposures: Receipt of PCV13 at ages []65 years, concordant with ACIP guidelines. Main outcomes and measures: We estimated the adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) for first LRTI and pneumonia episodes during each respiratory season, comparing PCV13-exposed and PCV13-unexposed time at risk for each participant using a self-matched inference framework. We computed aHR estimates using Cox proportional hazards models. We defined vaccine effectiveness (VE) as (1-aHR)*100%. We also estimated PCV13-attributable absolute reductions in incidence of LRTI and pneumonia. Results: Observations were available both before and after PCV13 receipt for 42,700 participants. Among these individuals, 1,419 experienced LRTI and 969 experienced pneumonia over approximately 26,000 combined years of follow-up before PCV13 receipt; 3,849 experienced LRTI and 2,727 experienced pneumonia over approximately 74,000 combined years of follow-up after PCV13 receipt. In adjusted analyses, VE was 9.5% (95% confidence interval: 2.2% to 16.3%) against all-cause medically-attended LRTI and 8.8% (-0.2% to 17.0%) against all-cause medically-attended pneumonia.

A family of acid-reducing drugs, known as histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA), competitively bind the H2R and block its stimulation by histamine; examples of such drugs are famotidine (e.g., Pepcid) and ranitidine (e.g., Zantac). A dense web of functionalities between histamine and H2RAs, on the one hand, and downstream cellular pathways, on the other hand, links disparate physiological pathways in gastrointestinal contexts (e.g., acid reduction) to the dysregulated inflammatory cascades (cytokine storm) underlying the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Is famotidine beneficial in treating COVID-19? This question remains unresolved, though not for lack of effort: over 10 studies have examined the potential therapeutic value of famotidine in COVID-19, but have found conflicting results (pro-famotidine, anti-famotidine, and neutral). Given the contradictory reports, we have undertaken the new analysis reported herein. Notably, studies published thus far rest upon substantially smaller datasets than drawn upon in the pre-sent work. We analyzed a cohort of 22,560 COVID-19 patients taking H1/H2 receptor antagonists, focusing on 1,379 severe cases requiring respiratory support. We analyzed outcomes for treatment with the H1RAs loratadine (e.g., Claritin) and cetirizine (e.g., Zyrtec), the H2RA famotidine, aspirin, and a famotidine & aspirin combination. For cases that reached the point of respiratory support, we found a significantly reduced fatality risk for famotidine treatment. We did not detect a benefit from dual-histamine receptor blockade (concurrently targeting H1 and H2 receptors). Notably, famotidine combined with aspirin did exhibit a significant synergistic survival benefit (odds ratio of 0.55). The relative risk for death decreased by 32.5%--an immense benefit, given the more than 2.6 million COVID-19-related deaths thus far. We found lower levels of serum markers for severe disease (e.g., C-reactive protein) in famotidine users, consistent with prior findings by others and with a role for famotidine in attenuating cytokine release. The large, international, multi-center retrospective study reported here, sampling over 250,000 COVID-19 cases, hopefully helps clarify the possible value of clinically-approved histamine antagonists such as famotidine. Given these findings, alongside the cost-effectiveness and mild side-effects of popular drugs like famotidine and aspirin, we suggest that further prospective clinical trials, perhaps utilizing the aspirin combination reported here, are advisable.","output":"Clinical Evidence for Improved Outcomes with Histamine Antagonists and Aspirin in 22,560 COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Ramadan lasts only for 1 month each year, it can be accompanied by significant changes in: both energy and nutritional intake; in the diet composition; in the working hours; and the usual way of life.

In the verses of the Qur'an, the exemption from fasting in certain situations such as illness is clearly stated. Despite this religious tolerance, many faithful who are eligible for the exemption observe the fast of Ramadan either for the spiritual aspect it provides by performing it, by religious guilt or to mark a normalization in the Muslim community for fear of the gaze of others.

MP and BP re-classified 84 of 300 patients (28%) from conventional IHC/FISH subtyping, and reclassified 42 of 195 patients (22%) of patients from their risk category based on traditional clinical factors (Table-1). Of the 38 patients with available post-neoadjuvant therapy outcome, 13 patients (34%) achieved pathologic complete response (pCR). 16 patients were classified as Her-2 enriched by IHC/FISH of which 9 (56%) achieved pCR. MP/BP aligned with the IHC/FISH Her-2 enriched classification in 11/16 patients, while 5 patients were reclassified to Luminal B by MP/BP. Of the 11 patients with concordant IHC/FISH and MP/BP results, 8 achieved pCR (73%), while one of the 5 cases reclassified to Luminal B achieved pCR (20%). Of the patients who were classified Luminal by IHC (9 patients), one patient achieved pCR (11%), and of the patients classified luminal (A or B) by MP/BP (12 patients) two achieved pCR (16%). Of the IHC-triple negative patients and genomic basal patients, three patients achieved pCR in each group (23% and 20%, respectively). Conclusion: Performing MP/BP tests on core needle biopsies hold a high success rate. Incorporating test results into peri-operative discussions may result in better-informed decisions about treatment planning and timing of surgery versus systemic therapy. A higher rate of pCR was seen in the MP/BP Her-2 enriched group compared to the IHC/FISH Her-2 enriched group. Although this workflow was designed to triage patients during the COVID pandemic, this approach has great potential beyond the pandemic.","output":"The utility of using genomic testing on needle core biopsies during the COVID-19 pandemic: Molecular characterization, risk stratification, neoadjuvant outcome, and future implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The term listening niche refers to the contexts in which people listen to music including what music they are listening to, with whom, when, where, and with what media. The first experiment investigates undergraduate students music listening niches in the initial COVID-19 lockdown period, 4 weeks immediately after the campus shut down abruptly. The second experiment explores how returning to a hybrid semester, the new normal, further affected these listening habits. In both experiments, the participants provided a list of their most frequently listened-to songs during the respective period of time. From these, they identified one song that seemed most associated with this period, their signature song, and stated why this song seemed relevant. These reasons were coded on nine underlying themes. Three clusters were found to underlie the themes: (1) emotional responses (2) memory associations, and (3) discovery of new music. We identified songs and reasons for selecting them that represented the three clusters and related these to the lyrical content. Compared to before the pandemic, participants in both experiments report listening more in general and on Spotify, but there were no differences in listening between lockdown and the new normal. Whom they were listening with shifted overtime from family members to significant others and finally to other friends and roommates.

The subtype H5N1 avian influenza occurs primarily in birds and infection varies from mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza). It is extremely rare for cats to be infected and there are only very few confirmed reports of the disease in cats in Europe. Infection Cats can be infected via the respiratory and oral routes (eg, by eating infected birds). The key precondition for infection is that the cat lives in an area where H5N1 virus infection has been confirmed in birds. Additionally, the cat should have had outdoor access to an environment where waterfowl is present, or contact with poultry or uncooked poultry meat, or close contact with an H5N1-infected, sick cat during the first week of infection. Clinical suspicion Clinical signs in cats may include fever, lethargy, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis and rapid death. Neurological signs (circling, ataxia) have also been recorded. Diagnosis The veterinary authorities should be notified. Oropharyngeal, nasal and/or rectal swabs or faecal samples of suspected cases should be submitted for PCR and/or virus isolation. Post-mortem samples of lung and mediastinal lymph nodes should be obtained. Particular care should be taken when handling the cat and/or samples. Disease management The virus is sensitive to all standard medical disinfectants. Cats with suspected H5N1 infection should be kept in strict isolation. Owners should be advised to confine the cat to a separate room prior to bringing it to the veterinary clinic. Vaccination and disease prevention No H5N1 vaccines are commercially available for cats. In the event of confirmed cases of H5N1 avian influenza in birds in the area, owners should keep their cats indoors until further information is available, and follow official regulations.","output":"H5N1 avian influenza in cats.

The aim of this paper was to summarize present literature on COVID pandemic and EDs. Methods: Literature search, study selection, methods, and quality evaluation were performed following PRISMA Guidelines. Results: The systematic search permitted the identification of 91 studies; 21 papers were eligible and included in the review. Nine papers (42.9%) evaluated the effect of pandemic and associated protective and risk factors in EDs patients, ten (47.6%) explored the prevalence of disturbed eating behaviours and risk factors for exacerbating EDs in the general population, and the remaining two (9.5%) were qualitative studies describing the impact of lockdown and quarantine on EDs patients. Their analysis revealed five main findings: 1) changes in physical activities routines were related to a worsening of preoccupation on weight/body shape; 2) food access limitation during pandemic represented a risk factors for both triggering and exacerbating EDs; 3) restriction in healthcare facilities contributed to increase anxiety levels and modifies treatment compliance; 4) social isolation was related to symptoms' exacerbation in EDs patients who are home-confined with family members; 5) conflicts and difficulties in relationships with 'no way out' were maintenance factors for EDs symptoms, especially in adolescents and young adults. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on EDs that might be triggered or worsened by the exceptional conditions deriving from COVID-19-related stress in predisposed subjects. Patients already affected by EDs experienced a worsening of their clinical conditions and related quality of life.","output":"Eating Disorders Spectrum during COVID Pandemic: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How can the knowledge of probiotics and their mechanisms of action be translated into clinical practice when treating patients with diverticular disease and acute diverticulitis? Changes in microbiota composition have been observed in patients who were developing acute diverticulitis, with a reduction of taxa with anti-inflammatory activity, such as Clostridium cluster IV, Lactobacilli and Bacteroides. Recent observations supported that a dysbiosis characterised by decreased presence of anti-inflammatory bacterial species might be linked to mucosal inflammation, and a vicious cycle results from a mucosal inflammation driving dysbiosis at the same time. An alteration in gut microbiota can lead to an altered activation of nerve fibres, and subsequent neuronal and muscular dysfunction, thus favoring abdominal symptoms development. The possible role of dysbiosis and mucosal inflammation in leading to dysmotility is linked, in turn, to bacterial translocation from the lumen of the diverticulum to perivisceral area. There, a possible activation of Toll-like receptors has been described, with a subsequent inflammatory reaction at the level of the perivisceral tissues. Being aware that bacterial colonisation of diverticula is involved in the pathogenesis of acute diverticulitis, the rationale for the potential role of probiotics in the treatment of this disease becomes clearer. For this review, articles were identified using the electronic PubMed database through a comprehensive search conducted by combining key terms such as gut microbiota, probiotics and gut disease, probiotics and acute diverticulitis, probiotics and diverticular disease, probiotics mechanism of action.

However, upon egg-sperm fusion in vertebrates, the zygote has three sets of chromosomes, one from the sperm and two from the egg. The zygote therefore eliminates one set of maternal chromosomes (but not the paternal chromosomes) into the polar body through meiosis, but how the paternal chromosomes are protected from maternal meiosis has been unclear. Here we report that RanGTP and F-actin dynamics prevent egg-sperm fusion in proximity to maternal chromosomes. RanGTP prevents the localization of Juno and CD9, egg membrane proteins that mediate sperm fusion, at the cell surface in proximity to maternal chromosomes. Following egg-sperm fusion, F-actin keeps paternal chromosomes away from maternal chromosomes. Disruption of these mechanisms causes the elimination of paternal chromosomes during maternal meiosis. This study reveals a novel critical mechanism that prevents aneuploidy in zygotes.","output":"RanGTP and the actin cytoskeleton keep paternal and maternal chromosomes apart during fertilization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The present pandemic COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus from the Coronaviridae family Due to a lack of antiviral drugs, vaccines against the virus are urgently required Methods: In this study, validated computational approaches were used to identify peptide-based epitopes from six structural proteins having antigenic properties The Net-CTL 1 2 tool was used for the prediction of CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, while the robust tools Bepi-Pred 2 and LBtope was employed for the identification of linear B-cell epitopes Docking studies of the identified epitopes were performed using HADDOCK 2 4 and the structures were visualized by Discovery Studio and LigPlot(+) Antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservancy, population coverage and allergenicity of the predicted epitopes were determined by the bioinformatics tools like VaxiJen v2 0 server, the Immune Epitope Database tools and AllerTOP v 2 0, AllergenFP 1 0 and ElliPro Results: The predicted T cell and linear B-cell epitopes were considered as prime vaccine targets in case they passed the requisite parameters like antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservancy, non-allergenicity and broad range of population coverage Among the predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes, potential vaccine targets from surface glycoprotein were;YQPYRVVVL, PYRVVVLSF, GVYFASTEK, QLTPTWRVY, and those from ORF3a protein were LKKRWQLAL, HVTFFIYNK Similarly, RFLYIIKLI, LTWICLLQF from membrane protein and three epitopes viz;SPRWYFYYL, TWLTYTGAI, KTFPPTEPK from nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were the superior vaccine targets observed in our study The negative values of HADDOCK and Z scores obtained for the best cluster indicated the potential of the epitopes as suitable vaccine candidates Analysis of the 3D and 2D interaction diagrams of best cluster produced by HADDOCK 2 4 displayed the binding interaction of leading T cell epitopes within the MHC-1 peptide binding clefts On the other hand, among linear B cell epitopes the majority of potential vaccine targets were from nucleocapsid protein, viz;(59-)HGKEDLKFPRGQGVPINTNSS PDDQIGYYRRATRRIRGGDGKMKDLS(-105), (227-)LNQLE SKMSGKGQQQQGQT VTKKSAAEASKKPRQKRTATK(-266), (3-)DNGPQNQRNAPRITFGGP(-20), (29-)GERSG ARSKQRRPQGL(-45) Two other prime vaccine targets, (370-)NSASFSTFKCYGVSPTK LNDLCFTNV-395 and (260-)AGAAAYYVGYLQPRT(-274) were identified in the spike protein The potential B-cell conformational epitopes were predicted on the basis of a higher protrusion index indicating greater solvent accessibility These conformational epitopes were of various lengths and belonged to spike, ORF3a, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins Conclusions: Taken together, eleven T cell epitopes, seven B cell linear epitopes and ten B cell conformational epitopes were identified from five structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced computational tools These potential vaccine candidates may provide important timely directives for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2","output":"Computational perspectives revealed prospective vaccine candidates from five structural proteins of novel SARS corona virus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International mobility has increased steadily in recent times, bringing along a myriad of health, social and health system challenges to migrants themselves and the host nations. Mental health issues have been identified as a significant problem among migrants, with poor accessibility and underutilisation of the available mental health services (MHSs) repeatedly reported, including in Australia. Using a qualitative inquiry and one-on-one in-depth interviews, this study explored perspectives of African migrants and service providers on barriers to accessing MHSs among African migrants in South Australia. The data collection took place during the COVID-19 pandemic with lockdown and other measures to combat the pandemic restricting face to face meetings with potential participants. Online platforms including Zoom and/or WhatsApp video calls were used to interview 20 African migrants and 10 service providers. Participants were recruited from community groups and/or associations, and organisations providing services for migrants and/or refugees in South Australia using the snowball sampling technique. Thematic framework analysis was used to guide the data analysis. Key themes centred on personal factors (health literacy including knowledge and the understanding of the health system, and poor financial condition), structural factors related to difficulties in navigating the complexity of the health system and a lack of culturally aware service provision, sociocultural and religious factors, mental health stigma and discrimination. The findings provide an insight into the experiences of African migrants of service provision to them and offer suggestions on how to improve these migrants mental health outcomes in Australia. Overcoming barriers to accessing mental health services would need a wide range of strategies including education on mental health, recognising variations in cultures for effective service provision, and addressing mental health stigma and discrimination which strongly deter service access by these migrants. These strategies will facilitate help-seeking behaviours as well as effective provision of culturally safe MHSs and improvement in access to MHSs among African migrants.","output":"Migrants and Service Providers Perspectives of Barriers to Accessing Mental Health Services in South Australia: A Case of African Migrants with a Refugee Background in South Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article was migrated.

There are several reports of gender differences related to infection and death due to COVID-19. This raises important questions such as \\"Whether there are differences based on gender in risk and severity of infection or mortality rate?\\" and \\"What are the biological explanation and mechanisms underlying these differences?\\" Emerging evidences have proposed sex-based immunological, genetic, and hormonal differences to explain this ambiguity. Besides biological differences, women have also faced social inequities and economic hardships due to this pandemic. Several recent studies have shown that independent of age males are at higher risk for severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar across both genders in several disease cohorts, a disproportionate death ratio in men can be partly explained by the higher burden of pre-existing diseases and occupational exposures among men. At immunological point of view, females can engage a more active immune response, which may protect them and counter infectious diseases as compared to men. This attribute of better immune responses towards pathogens is thought to be due to high estrogen levels in females.

This included the cancellation of consultations for patients with rare diseases, such as severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), resulting in potential medication shortage and loss of follow-up. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate PH patient health status evolution, access to health care and mental health experience during the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online patient survey, available in 16 languages, between 22/05/2020 and 28/06/2020. The survey included questions corresponding to demographic, COVID-19 and PH related information. RESULTS: 1073 patients (or relatives, 27%) from 52 countries all over the world participated in the survey. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of responders reported a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and 15% of chronic thromboembolic PH. The COVID-19 related events were few: only 1% of all responders reported a diagnosis of COVID-19. However, 8% of patients reported health deterioration possibly related to PH, and 4% hospitalization for PH. Besides, 11% of the patients reported difficulties to access their PH expert centre, and 3% interruption of treatment due to shortage of medication. Anxiety or depression was reported by 67% of the participants. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 incidence in PH patients was low, PH related problems occurred frequently as the pandemic progressed, including difficulties to have access to specialized care.

Protective sterile immunity (>90%) against the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) has been achieved using a transgenically modified Plasmodium berghei sporozoite (Tg-Pb/PfCSP) and a self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) vaccine presenting CSP epitopes (PfCSP-SAPN). Here, several possible mechanisms involved in the independently protective humoral and cellular responses induced following SAPN immunization are described. METHODS: Inbred mice were vaccinated with PfCSP-SAPN in PBS. Serum antibodies were harvested and effects on P. falciparum sporozoites mobility and integrity were examined using phase contrast microscopy. The functionality of SAPN-induced antibodies on inhibition of sporozoite invasion and growth within primary human hepatocytes was also examined. The internal processing of SAPN by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDDC), using organelle-specific, fluorescent-tagged antibody or gold-encapsulated SAPN, was observed using confocal or electron microscopy, respectively. RESULTS: The results of this work demonstrate that PfCSP-SAPN induces epitope-specific antibody titers, predominantly of the Th2 isotype IgG1, and that serum antibodies from PfCSP-SAPN-immunized mice appear to target P. falciparum sporozoites via the classical pathway of complement. This results in sporozoite death as indicated by cessation of motility and the circumsporozoite precipitation reaction. Moreover, PfCSP-SAPN-induced antibodies are able to inhibit wild-type P. falciparum sporozoite invasion and growth within cultured primary human hepatocytes. In addition, the observation that PfCSP-SAPN are processed (and presented) to the immune system by dendritic cells in a slow and continuous fashion via transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) recruitment to the early endosome (EE), and have partially delayed processing through the endoplasmic reticulum, has the potential to induce the long-lived, effector memory CD8(+) T-cells as described previously. CONCLUSION: This paper describes the examination of humoral and cellular immune mechanisms induced by PfCSP-SAPN vaccination which result in sterile host protection against a transgenic P. berghei malaria sporozoite expressing the P. falciparum CSP, and which significantly inhibits native P. falciparum sporozoites from invading and developing within cultured human hepatocytes. These results may indicate the type and mode of action of protective antibodies needed to control P. falciparum sporozoites from infecting humans as well as a potential mechanism of induction of protective long-lived effector memory CD8(+) T-cells.","output":"Mechanisms of protective immune responses induced by the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein-based, self-assembling protein nanoparticle vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of red blood cell (RBC) caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene resulting in abnormal hemoglobin known as hemoglobin S (HbS) or the sickle hemoglobin. Several clinical variants of SCD have been elucidated, all driven by two fundamental pathophysiologic processes: RBC hemolysis and intermittent vaso-occlusive vasculopathy resulting in tissue ischemia/infarction. These two processes underscore the many complications and eventual multi-organ damage that may develop in patients with the most severe types of SCD. Cardiopulmonary complications including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and acute chest syndrome (ACS) are major drivers of morbidity and mortality among patients with SCD. With regards to ACS, patients often present with fever, cough and shortness of breath caused by vaso-occlusive crisis affecting the lungs. This is particular concerning in view of its similar features to symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Methods We retrospectively identified SCD patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to Beaumont hospitals in Michigan between March 1st 2020 and July 1st 2020. Data was abstracted using the ICD 10 code of U07. 1 for COVID-19, ICD 9 and 10 codes of 282.60 and D57 for sickle cell disease. We excluded patients with sickle cell trait. Data regarding the demographics, presentation, management and outcomes were abstracted. Results A total of eleven patients with sickle cell disease were identified as having a positive SARS-Cov19 polymerase chain reaction test (Table I). All were African American and predominantly female (64%) with a mean age of 44 (22-60) years and mean BMI of 30.2 kg/m2. Genotypes identified were HbSS in 5 (45%) patients, HbSC in 4 (36%), HbS/beta-thalassemia in 1 (9%) and HbS/alpha-thalassemia in 1 (9%). All of the patients had seen a haematologist since their diagnosis but none of the patients were on hydroxyurea, voxeloter, L-glutamine or crizanlizumab at admission. The predominant clinical presentation was fever, chest pain, chills, exertional shortness of breath and cough but this was not consistent across all patients. All the patients were managed with intravenous hydration, pain management as well as hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin per institutional guideline at that time. Three patients (cases 1-3) had recurrent visits to the hospital for similar symptoms and new bone pain crises. Case 1 had a pulmonary embolus which was evident on re-admission. Two patients (cases 3 and 10) succumbed to COVID-19. Two patients (cases 5 and 7) presented with bone pain crisis and no respiratory symptoms, but chest imaging was suggestive of COVID-19 infection necessitating treatment with antibiotics, possibly indicating that the virus can trigger vaso-occlusive crises without respiratory symptoms. Case 8 had a high Charlson comorbidity index and age over 60, had the lengthiest hospital stay complicated by renal failure and polyneuropathy, and was discharged to a long-term acute care facility: an outcome which is consistent with current data showing that the elderly and unfit patients are more likely to have a higher morbidity and mortality with COVID-19. Conclusion To date, there no compelling evidence to provide guidelines for the management of SCD patients with COVID-19. However, following existing recommendations in managing acute chest syndrome and those for COVID-19 symptomatic infection, is a good place to start. We continue to seek to improve management of these patients as new evidence of successful treatment emerges, and also encourage patients to participate in clinical trials.

In ICH patients, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor for poor outcomes. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used to reduce hematoma expansion. We analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of tranexamic acid. METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of ICH patients who underwent follow-up computed tomography scans from October 2008 to October 2018. Of the 329 included patients, 67 who received tranexamic acid and 262 who did not receive tranexamic acid were compared. We also analyzed the risk factors of 45 and 284 patients who did and did not experience hematoma expansion, respectively.

Increases in work-related sitting time during workdays, total sitting time during workdays, and total work-related sitting time were significantly associated with an increase in the physical activity aspect of fatigue (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.12, P=.03; b=0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.09, P=.02; and b=0.07, 95% CI 0-0.14, P=.04, respectively). The motivation and physical activity aspects of fatigue increased by 0.06 for each 1-hour increase in total sitting time between baseline and follow-up (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.11, P=.045; and b=0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.10, P=.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that sedentary and active behaviors among company workers in Japan were negatively affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. Increases in several domain-specific sedentary behaviors also contributed to unfavorable changes in workers' fatigue. Social distancing and teleworking amid a pandemic may contribute to the sedentary lifestyle of company workers. Public health interventions are needed to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics on sedentary and physical activity behaviors and fatigue among company workers.","output":"Changes in Workers' Sedentary and Physical Activity Behaviors in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Their Relationships With Fatigue: Longitudinal Online Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for 71% of deaths worldwide and individual behaviours such as sedentariness play an important role on their development and management. However, the detrimental effect of daily sitting on multiple NCDs has rarely been studied. This study sought (i) to investigate the association between sitting time and main NCDs and multimorbidity in the population of Catalonia and (ii) to explore the effect of physical activity as a modifier of the associations between sitting time and health outcomes. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the 2016 National Health Survey of Catalonia were analyzed, and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for socio-demographics and individual risk factors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, diet, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, body mass index) was used to estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between sitting time and NCDs. RESULTS: A total of 3320 people 15 years old were included in the study. Sitting more than 5 h/day was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (OR 1.90, 95% CI: 1.21C2.97), respiratory disease (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.13C2.30) and multimorbidity (OR 2.80, 95% CI: 1.53C5.15). Sitting more than 3 h/day was also associated with a higher risk of multimorbidity (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.23C4.16). Physical activity did not modify the associations between sitting time and any of the outcomes.

In this study, we aim to determine the rate of undetected infection in HCWs, a potential source of nosocomial infection. METHODS: Serological screening for IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was carried out among HCWs from four different hospitals in Madrid, Spain, from 6 April to 25 April 2020; HCWs with a previous diagnosis of infection based on real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay performed after presenting compatible symptoms were excluded. Prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies was calculated among HCWs to obtain the rate of COVID-19 presence of antibodies in each hospital. RESULTS: Of the 7121 HCWs studied, 6344 (89.09%) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. A total of 5995 HCWs finally participated in the study, resulting in a participation rate of 94.49%.

To evaluate the impact of this disease on placental tissue and perinatal outcome, histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses of placental tissue were performed for five cases of pregnant women with COVID-19. CASE REPORTS: All five pregnant women in this series developed COVID-19 in late pregnancy. Two patients experienced respiratory distress, and computed tomography revealed signs of pneumonia, with bilateral involvement, multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities. Histological studies of placental tissue revealed the presence of slight signs of maternal vascular underperfusion (MVUs) or foetal vascular underperfusion (FVUs) lesions and mild inflammatory lesions. CD15 immunoreactivity in the placental tissue was low in all cases, demonstrating that in these cases there was not severe foetal hypoxia/asphyxia risk for newborns or distal vascular immaturity. In all cases examined, ultrastructural analyses showed spherical-like coronavirus particles with an electron intermediate-density core as well as projections from the surface as spike-like structures in the syncytiotrophoblasts. At term, all of the women delivered newborns who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal testing in their first day of life. All newborns were exclusively breastfed and were discharged on the 3rd day of life. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, placental patterns in pregnancy due to COVID-19 in the late stage of gestation indicate no evidence of vertical trans-placental SARS-CoV-2 transmission or a significant impact on the perinatal outcome of newborns, in both mild and more severe cases.","output":"COVID-19 in pregnancy: placental pathological patterns and effect on perinatal outcome in five cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this national survey was to explore pregnant womens perceptions of COVID-19 and their healthcare experiences.

COVID-19 is a disease with symptoms that range from fever and breathing difficulty to acute respiratory distress and death, critically affecting older patients and people with previous comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract, which it then uses to reach several organs.

METHODS: This study consisted of PCR-proven COVID-19 patients. Cases with COVID-19-related anosmia constituted Group 1 and cases without any olfactory dysfunction (OD) throughout COVID-19 infection or after recovery constituted Group 2. A total of 50 patients were included in the study, comprising 24 cases in Group 1 and 26 cases in Group 2. Group 1 patients underwent a 4-item-odor identification test during active symptoms and a Sniffin' Sticks test after reconversion of PCR results to negative. All patients in Group 2 also underwent the Sniffin' Stick test to document normosmia. All cases had paranasal sinus CT performed. Olfactory cleft widths and olfactory volumes were measured. The differences in width and volume between groups and the correlation with odor test scores (threshold-discrimination-identification [TDI]) were calculated. In addition, regression analyzes analysis was performed for cleft widths, volumes, and TDI scores according to age. RESULTS: Olfactory cleft widths and olfactory volumes were significantly higher in Group 1 than those in Group 2 (p = 0.001; p < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between total TDI scores and olfactory cleft widths and total olfactory volumes (r = ?0.665; r = ?0.731, respectively). Patients younger than 40 years of age had significantly higher right olfactory cleft width, left olfactory cleft width, and olfactory cleft volume than those in patients older than 40 years of age (p = 0.004, p = 0.005, p = 0.003; p < 0,01, respectively). However, patients younger than 40 years of age had a significantly lower total TDI score and in all other values individually (t-d-i) than those in patients older than 40 years of age (p = 0.004; p < 0.01).

Late diagnosis of cancer is also due to the inferential gaps at the primary care.

Electronic health records (EHR) had some success in mitigating the wrong site, wrong side, wrong procedure, wrong person (WSWP) errors, and the general medical errors;however, these errors continue to be quite significant. In the last few decades the disease demography has changed from quick onset infectious diseases to slow onset non-communicable diseases (NCD).

METHODS: The SEI2RS model considers five strategies for control, namely: large-scale social restriction (u(1)), contact tracing (u(2)), mass testing (u(3)), case detection and treatment (u(4)), and the wearing of face masks (u(5)). Three scenarios were developed, each differentiated by the controls. The model used April 10, 2020, and December 31, 2020, as the initial and final times. RESULTS: The simulation results indicated that the peak of COVID-19 cases for scenarios 1, 2, and 3 occur on the 59th day with 33,151 cases, on the 38th day with 37,908 cases, and on the 40th day with 39,305 cases.

We hypothesized that cluster analysis could be performed on common clinical variables to define more objective sarcoidosis phenotypes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 554 sarcoidosis cases to identify distinct phenotypes of sarcoidosis based on 29 clinical features. Model-based clustering was performed using the VarSelLCM R package and the Integrated Completed Likelihood (ICL) criteria were used to estimate number of clusters. To identify features associated with cluster membership, features were ranked based on variable importance scores from the VarSelLCM model, and additional univariate tests (Fishers exact test and one-way ANOVA) were performed using q-values correcting for multiple testing. The Wasfi severity score was also compared between clusters. RESULTS: Cluster analysis resulted in 6 sarcoidosis phenotypes. Salient characteristics for each cluster are as follows: Phenotype (1) supranormal lung function and majority Scadding stage 2/3; phenotype (2) supranormal lung function and majority Scadding stage 0/1; phenotype (3) normal lung function and split Scadding stages between 0/1 and 2/3; phenotype (4) obstructive lung function and majority Scadding stage 2/3; phenotype (5) restrictive lung function and majority Scadding stage 2/3; phenotype (6) mixed obstructive and restrictive lung function and mostly Scadding stage 4. Although there were differences in the percentages, all Scadding stages were encompassed by all of the phenotypes, except for phenotype 1, in which none were Scadding stage 4. Clusters 4, 5, 6 were significantly more likely to have ever been on immunosuppressive treatment and had higher Wasfi disease severity scores. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster analysis produced 6 sarcoidosis phenotypes that demonstrated less severe and severe phenotypes.

To study this, we choose economic production networks as a paradigm. An economic network can be examined at many levels: linkages among individual agents (microscopic), among firms/sectors (mesoscopic) or among countries (macroscopic). New emergent dynamical properties appear at every level, so the granularity matters. For viral epidemics, even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and potentially affect the entire network. Economic networks, however, are known to be immune at the micro-levels and more prone to failure in the meso/macro-levels. We propose a dynamical interaction model to characterize the mechanism of distress propagation, across different modules of a network, initiated at different epicenters. Vulnerable modules often lead to large degrees of destabilization. We demonstrate our methodology using a unique empirical data-set of input-output linkages across 0.14 million firms in one administrative state of India, a developing economy. The network has multiple hub-and-spoke structures that exhibits moderate disassortativity, which varies with the level of coarse-graining. The novelty lies in characterizing the production network at different levels of granularity or modularity, and finding \`too-big-to-fail' modules supersede \`too-central-to-fail' modules in distress propagation.","output":"Distress propagation on production networks: Coarse-graining and modularity of linkages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE Chronic pain is common in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), for whom it negatively affects quality of life, and its treatment requires an integrated approach. To this end, lower limb functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling holds promise. OBJECTIVE To investigate pain reduction in a sample of patients with SCI by means of lower limb rehabilitation using FES cycling. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Sixteen patients with incomplete and complete SCIs, attending the Neurorobotic Unit of our research institute and reporting pain at or below the level of their SCI were recruited to this exploratory study. INTERVENTIONS Patients undertook two daily sessions of FES cycling, six times weekly, for 6 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES Pain outcomes were measured using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS), the Multidimensional Pain Inventory for SCI (MPI-SCI), and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Finally, we assessed the features of dorsal laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to objectively evaluate A ?ber pathways. RESULTS All participants tolerated the intervention well, and completed the training without side effects. Statistically significant changes were found in pain-NRS, MPI-SCI, and SF-36 scores, and LEP amplitudes. Following treatment, we found that three patients experienced high pain relief (an NRS decrease of at least 80%), six individuals achieved moderate pain relief (an NRS decrease of about 30-70%), and five participants had mild pain relief (an NRS decrease of less than 30%). CONCLUSION Our preliminary results suggest that FES cycling training is capable of reducing the pain reported by patients with SCI, regardless of American Spinal Injury Association scoring, pain level, or the neurological level of injury. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying such effects are likely to be both spinal and supraspinal.","output":"Paving the way for a better management of pain in patients with spinal cord injury: An exploratory study on the use of Functional Electric Stimulation(FES)-cycling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article endeavors to investigate the change in the mindset of the people towards health insurance sector.

This study assesses COVID-19 knowledge and case management of informal providers (IPs), trained practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) and Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) medical doctors providing primary care services in rural Bihar, India. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of primary care providers conducted via telephone between 1 and 15 July 2020. SETTING: Primary care providers from 224 villages in 34 districts across Bihar, India. PARTICIPANTS: 452 IPs, 57 AYUSH practitioners and 38 doctors (including 23 government doctors) were interviewed from a census of 1138 primary care providers used by community members that could be reached by telephone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Providers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with choice-based answers to gather information on (1) change in patient care seeking, (2) source of COVID-19 information, (3) knowledge on COVID-19 spread, symptoms and methods for prevention and (4) clinical management of COVID-19. RESULTS: During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, 72% of providers reported a decrease in patient visits. Most IPs and other private primary care providers reported receiving no COVID-19 related engagement with government or civil society agencies. For them, the principal source of COVID-19 information was television and newspapers. IPs had reasonably good knowledge of typical COVID-19 symptoms and prevention, and at levels similar to doctors. However, there was low stated compliance among IPs (16%) and qualified primary care providers (15% of MBBS doctors and 12% of AYUSH practitioners) with all WHO recommended management practices for suspect COVID-19 cases. Nearly half of IPs and other providers intended to treat COVID-19 suspects without referral. CONCLUSIONS: Poor management practices of COVID-19 suspects by rural primary care providers weakens government pandemic control efforts. Government action of providing information to IPs, as well as engaging them in contact tracing or public health messaging can strengthen pandemic control efforts.","output":"Pandemic response in pluralistic health systems: a cross-sectional study of COVID-19 knowledge and practices among informal and formal primary care providers in Bihar, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has rapidly spread, causing million confirmed cases, thousands of deaths, and economic losses. The number of cases of COVID-19 in Jakarta is the largest in Indonesia. Furthermore, Jakarta is the capital city of Indonesia which has the densest population in the country. There is need for geospatial analysis to evaluate the demand in contrast to the capacity of Referral Hospitals and to model the spreading case of Covid-19 in order to support and organize an effective health service. METHODS: We used the data from local government publicity for COVID-19 as trusted available sources. By using the verifiable data by observation from the local government, we estimated the spatial pattern of distribution of cases to estimate the growing cases. We performed service area and Origin-Destination (OD) Cost Matrix in support to existing referral hospital, and to create Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) model to determine the spatial distribution of COVID-19. RESULTS: We identified more than 12.4 million people (86.7%) based on distance-based service area, live in the well served area of the referral hospital. A total 2637 positive-infected cases were identified and highly concentrated in West Jakarta (1096 cases). The results of OD cost matrix in a range of 10 km show a total 908 unassigned cases from 24 patients centroid which was highly concentrated in West Jakarta.

Certain NPIs, like limiting social contacts or lockdowns, had negative consequences for mental health in the population. Especially elder people are prone to mental illnesses during the current pandemic. This article investigates how social factors, infections rates, and stringency of NPIs are associated with a decline in mental health in different European countries. METHODS: Data stem from the eighth wave of the SHARE survey. Additional data sources were used to build macro indicators for infection rates and NPIs. Two subsamples of persons with mental health problems were selected (people who reported being depressed, n = 9.240 or nervous/anxious, n = 10.551). Decline in mental health was assessed by asking whether depressive symptoms or nervousness/anxiety have become worse since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. For each outcome, logistic regression models with survey-design were used to estimate odds ratios (OR), using social factors (age, gender, education, living alone, and personal contacts) and macro indicators (stringency of NPIs and infection rates) as predictors. RESULTS: Higher age was associated with a lower likelihood of becoming more depressed (OR 0.87) or nervous/anxious (OR 0.88), while female gender increased the odds of a decline in mental health (OR 1.53 for being more depressed; OR 1.57 for being more nervous/anxious). Higher education was only associated with becoming more nervous/anxious (OR 1.59), while living alone or rare personal contacts were not statistically significant. People from countries with higher infection rates were more likely to become more depressed (OR 3.31) or nervous/anxious (OR 4.12), while stringency of NPIs showed inconsistent associations. CONCLUSION: A majority of European older adults showed a decline in mental health since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is especially true in countries with high prevalence rates of COVID-19. Among older European adults, age seems to be a protective factor for a decline in mental health while female gender apparently is a risk factor. Moreover, although NPIs are an essential preventative mechanism to reduce the pandemic spread, they might influence the vulnerability for elderly people suffering from mental health problems.","output":"Decline in Mental Health in the Beginning of the COVID-19 Outbreak Among European Older AdultsAssociations With Social Factors, Infection Rates, and Government Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enriching the script of a story with visual aids is an effective approach for promoting language learning and literacy development for young children and learners.

If the mouth and nose of patients with infection are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help the patients by killing any coronavirus present at those sites. It may also reduce the risk of the active infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to both the patients and the HCWs caring for them. SEARCH METHODS: Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered with any frequency or dosage to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) RECOVERY* (www.recoverytrial.net) outcomes in patients (mortality; hospitalisation status; use of ventilation; use of renal dialysis or haemofiltration); 2) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 3) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 4) change in COVID-19 viral load in patients; 5) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 6) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 7) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified 16 ongoing studies (including 14 RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 1250 participants. The interventions included in these trials are ArtemiC (artemisinin, curcumin, frankincense and vitamin C), Citrox (a bioflavonoid), cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorine dioxide, essential oils, hydrogen peroxide, hypertonic saline, Kerecis spray (omega 3 viruxide - containing neem oil and St John's wort), neem extract, nitric oxide releasing solution, povidone iodine and saline with baby shampoo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by a number of RCTs and other studies. We are concerned that few of the ongoing studies specifically state that they will evaluate adverse events such as changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.","output":"Antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to improve patient outcomes and to protect healthcare workers treating them"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Anxiety is an extremely prevalent condition, and yet, it has received notably less attention than depression and other mental health conditions from a research, clinical, and public health perspective. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated growing concerns about the burden of anxiety due to the confluence of physical health risks, economic stressors, social isolation, and general disruption of daily activities. OBJECTIVE: This study examines differences in anxiety outcomes by care modality (coaching, teletherapy and telepsychiatry, and combined care) within an on-demand mental health system. We also explore the association between levels of engagement within each care modality and odds of improvement in symptoms of anxiety. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of individuals who accessed Ginger, an on-demand mental health system. Data were collected from 1611 Ginger members between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used logistic regression to assess the association between care modality and improvement in anxiety symptoms. Within each modality, we assessed the association between level of engagement and improvement. RESULTS: Of 1611 Ginger members, 761 (47.0%) experienced a decrease in anxiety symptoms, as measured by a change from a positive to a negative 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screen. Among members who still screened positive at follow-up (865/1611, 53%), a total of 192 members (11.9%) experienced a clinically significant score reduction in the full GAD-7 (ie, a score reduction of >5 points), even though their GAD-2 scores were still positive. All modalities showed increased odds of improvement compared to those who were not engaged with coaching or clinical services (\\"app-only\\"). Higher GAD-7 intake scores were also associated with decreased odds of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This study found increased odds of anxiety improvement for all care modalities compared to those who did not engage in care, with larger effect sizes for higher utilization within all care modalities. Additionally, there is a promising observation that those engaged in combined care (teletherapy and text-based coaching) had the greatest odds of anxiety improvement.

OSA refers to the concurrent deterioration of bone (osteopenia/osteoporosis), muscle (sarcopenia) and adipose tissue expansion. It portrays the most advanced stage in a continuum of body composition disorders. Although OSA has been widely studied involving the populations of different backgrounds, its prevalence is hard to collate because different methodologies and criteria were used for its diagnosis. Another critical health aspect is the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI) which contributes to OSA and vice versa. Nutrition is important in the prevention and management of both OSA and LGCI. Although micronutrients act in numerous metabolic and physiological processes, their roles here are presented in relation to OSA (and its components) and LGCI in general and relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and vitamins D and K; their interactions, physiological ratios and synergism/antagonism are discussed as well. In conclusion, calcium, magnesium and vitamin D have a profound impact on OSA and its components, and the latter two also on LGCI. Potassium and vitamin K are vital in bone, muscle functioning and possibly adipose tissue modification. Both, but particularly vitamin D, surfaced as important modulators of immune system with application in COVID-19 infections. While both phosphorus and sodium have important roles in bone, muscle and can impact adiposity, due to their abundance in food, their intake should be curbed to prevent possible damaging effects.","output":"Osteosarcopenic adiposity syndrome update and the role of associated minerals and vitamins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Graduated compression stockings are widely used for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Although below-knee stockings are used more often than thigh-length stockings, no reliable evidence indicates that they are as effective as thigh-length stockings. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of thigh-length stockings with that of below-knee stockings for preventing proximal DVT in immobile, hospitalized patients with stroke. DESIGN Parallel-group trial with centralized randomization (minimization within centers) to ensure allocation concealment. The ultrasonographers who looked for DVT were blinded, but the patients and caregivers were not. (Controlled-trials.com registration number: ISRCTN28163533) SETTING 112 hospitals in 9 countries. PATIENTS 3114 immobile patients hospitalized with acute stroke between January 2002 and May 2009. INTERVENTION 1552 patients received thigh-length stockings and 1562 patients received below-knee stockings to wear while they were in the hospital. MEASUREMENTS Ultrasonographers performed compression duplex ultrasonography in 1406 patients (96% of survivors) in each treatment group between 7 and 10 days after enrollment. They performed a second scan in 643 patients in the thigh-length stockings group and 639 in the below-knee stockings group at about 25 to 30 days. The primary outcome was symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins, detected on either scan. RESULTS Patients were retained in their assigned group for all analyses. The primary outcome occurred in 98 patients (6.3%) who received thigh-length stockings and 138 (8.8%) who received below-knee stockings (absolute difference, 2.5 percentage points [95% CI, 0.7 to 4.4 percentage points]; P = 0.008), an odds reduction of 31% (CI, 9% to 47%). Seventy-five percent of patients in both groups wore the stockings for 30 days or until they were discharged, died, or regained mobility. Skin breaks occurred in 61 patients who received thigh-length stockings (3.9%) and 45 (2.9%) who received below-knee stockings. LIMITATION Blinding was incomplete, 2 scans were not obtained for all enrolled patients, and the trial was stopped before the target accrual was reached. CONCLUSION Proximal DVT occurs more often in patients with stroke who wear below-knee stockings than in those who wear thigh-length stockings.

There is paucity of data on the systemic and local reactions experienced by COVD-19 vaccine recipients in South Asia. Objectives: To identify the early local and systemic reactogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Method: A multicenter observational study was performed to identify the reactogenicity to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in healthcare workers following the first dose. Results: There were 4478 participants with a median age of 42 years (IQR 34-51) and 2863 (63.9%) were females. At least one symptom of reactogenicity was reported by 4151 (92.7%). Local reactions were reported by 2612 (58.3%). Systemic reactions were bodyache (3244,72.4%), fatigue (2379, 53.1%), headache (2277, 50.8%), fever (2290, 51.1%), feverishness (1912, 42.7%) and chills (2295, 51.3%). Lower age (p<0.0001) and female gender (p 0.002) were associated with a higher frequency of developing systemic reactions. There was no association between reactogenicity and comorbidities. There were 342 (7.6%) reports of palpitations and one case of ventricular bigeminy. There was one report of anaphylaxis and hospital admissions were reported by 24 (0.5%). One vaccine recipient was managed for possible aseptic meningitis. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that early systemic and local reactions are common. Systemic reactions were more frequent in females and in the younger population. Most symptoms were self- limiting and did not require medical attention or hospital admission.

METHODS: We used the data of mortality estimation from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The absolute number of deaths from and mortality rates of infectious diseases in each country were derived from the database from 1990 to 2019. Age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) was used to compare populations in different regions and times. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of rates quantified the infectious disease mortality trends. RESULTS: BRICS respectively accounted for 39% and 32% of the global infectious disease deaths, in 1990 and 2019. Lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and diarrheal diseases contributed the most to the number of deaths in 1990 and 2019. In BRICS, ASMRs of all infectious diseases except sexually transmitted infections (STIs) decreased. The highest STI ASMRs were in South Africa; the highest ASMRs of enteric infections, neglected tropical diseases and malaria, and other infectious diseases were in India; South Africa and India both had relatively high respiratory infection ASMRs.

Older adults benefit less from glimpses, but masking release is typically investigated using isolated sentences. Recent work indicates that using engaging, continuous speech materials (e.g., spoken stories) may qualitatively alter speech-in-noise listening. Moreover, neural sensitivity to different amplitude envelope profiles (ramped, damped) changes with age, but whether this affects speech listening is unknown. In three online experiments, we investigate how masking release in younger and older adults differs for masked sentences and stories, and how speech intelligibility varies with masker amplitude profile. Intelligibility was generally greater for damped than ramped maskers. Masking release was reduced in older relative to younger adults for disconnected sentences, and stories with a randomized sentence order. Critically, when listening to stories with an engaging and coherent narrative, older adults demonstrated equal or greater masking release compared to younger adults. Older adults thus appear to benefit from 'glimpses' as much as, or more than, younger adults when the speech they are listening to follows a coherent topical thread. Our results highlight the importance of cognitive and motivational factors for speech understanding, and suggest that previous work may have underestimated speech-listening abilities in older adults.","output":"Age-related deficits in dip-listening evident for isolated sentences but not for spoken stories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cognitive impairment (CI) is important for the prognosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Early prediction whether and when cognitive decline from normal cognition (NC) will occur is crucial for preventing or delaying the progression timely.

METHODS 108 patients with PD were collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), of whom 58 had progressed to CI and 50 remained NC during 5-year follow up. Radiomics signatures were obtained by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression algorithm. Clinical factors and laboratory biomarkers were selected by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The combined model of radiomics signatures and clinical risk factors was developed by a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. A multi-predictor nomogram derived from the combined model was established for individualized estimation of time to progress (TTP) of CI. We analyzed the risk of two subgroups of the combined model by Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis.

This approach attempts to optimize the therapies and the patient care based on the individual patient characteristics. Its success highly depends on the way the characterization of the disease and its evolution, the patients classification, its follow-up and the treatment could be optimized. Thus, personalized medicine must combine innovative tools to measure, integrate and model data. Towards this goal, clinical metabolomics appears as ideally suited to obtain relevant information. Indeed, the metabolomics signature brings crucial insight to stratify patients according to their responses to a pathology and/or a treatment, to provide prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers, and to improve therapeutic outcomes. However, the translation of metabolomics from laboratory studies to clinical practice remains a subsequent challenge. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) are the two key platforms for the measurement of the metabolome. NMR has several advantages and features that are essential in clinical metabolomics. Indeed, NMR spectroscopy is inherently very robust, reproducible, unbiased, quantitative, informative at the structural molecular level, requires little sample preparation and reduced data processing. NMR is also well adapted to the measurement of large cohorts, to multi-sites and to longitudinal studies. This review focus on the potential of NMR in the context of clinical metabolomics and personalized medicine. Starting with the current status of NMR-based metabolomics at the clinical level and highlighting its strengths, weaknesses and challenges, this article also explores how, far from the initial opposition or competition, NMR and MS have been integrated and have demonstrated a great complementarity, in terms of sample classification and biomarker identification. Finally, a perspective discussion provides insight into the current methodological developments that could significantly raise NMR as a more resolutive, sensitive and accessible tool for clinical applications and point-of-care diagnosis. Thanks to these advances, NMR has a strong potential to join the other analytical tools currently used in clinical settings.","output":"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Clinical Metabolomics and Personalized Medicine: Current Challenges and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, data has shown that age-adjusted overdose death rates involving synthetic opioids, psychostimulants, cocaine, and heroin have been increasing, including prescription opioid deaths, which were declining, but, recently, reversing the trends. Contrary to widely held perceptions, the problem of misuse, abuse, and diversion of prescription opioids has been the least of all the factors in recent years. Consequently, it is important to properly distinguish between the role of illicit and prescription opioids in the current opioid crisis. Multiple efforts have been based on consensus on administrative policies for certain harm reduction strategies for individuals actively using illicit drugs and reducing opioid prescriptions leading to curbing of medically needed opioids, which have been ineffective. While there is no denial that prescription opioids can be misused, abused, and diverted, the policies have oversimplified the issue by curbing prescription opioids and the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of severely limiting prescription opioids, without acknowledgement that opioids have legitimate uses for persons suffering from chronic pain. Similar to the opioid crisis, interventional pain management procedures have been affected by various policies being applied to reduce overuse, abuse, and finally utilization. Medical policies have been becoming more restrictive with reduction of access to certain procedures, with the pendulum swinging too far in the direction of limiting interventional techniques. Recent utilization assessments have shown a consistent decline for most interventional techniques, with a 18.7% decrease from 2019 to 2020. The causes for these dynamic changes are multifactorial likely including the misapplication of the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, the relative ease of access to illicit synthetic opioids and more recently issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, recent publications have shown association of dose tapering with overdose or mental health crisis among patients prescribed long-term opioids. These findings are leading to the hypothesis that federal guidelines may inadvertently be contributing to an increase in overall opioid deaths and diminished access to interventional techniques. Together, these have resulted in a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic. METHODS: A narrative review. RESULTS: The fourth wave results from a confluence of multiple factors, including misapplication of CDC guidelines, the increased availability of illicit drugs, the COVID-19 pandemic, and policies reducing access to interventional procedures. The CDC guidelines and subsequent regulatory atmosphere have led to aggressive tapering up to and including, at times, the overall reduction or stoppage of opioid prescriptions. Forced tapering has been linked to an increase of 69% for overdoses and 130% for mental health crisis. The data thus suggests that the diminution in access to opioid prescriptions may be occurring simultaneously with an increase in illicit narcotic use.Combined with CDC guidelines, the curbing of opioid prescriptions to medically needed individuals, among non-opioid treatments, interventional techniques have been affected with declining utilization rates and medical policies reducing access to such modalities. CONCLUSION: The opioid overdose waves over the past three decades have resulted from different etiologies. Wave one was associated with prescription opioid overdose deaths and wave two with the rise in heroin and overdose deaths from 1999 to 2013. Wave three was associated with a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths. Sadly, wave four continues to escalate with increasing number of deaths as a confluence of factors including the CDC guidelines, the COVID pandemic, increased availability of illicit synthetic opioids and the reduction of access to interventional techniques, which leads patients to seek remedies on their own.","output":"Fourth Wave of Opioid (Illicit Drug) Overdose Deaths and Diminishing Access to Prescription Opioids and Interventional Techniques: Cause and Effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is the most effective public health intervention to prevent influenza infections, which are responsible for an important burden of respiratory illnesses and deaths each year. Currently, licensed influenza vaccines are mostly split inactivated, although in order to achieve higher efficacy rates, some influenza vaccines contain adjuvants. Although split-inactivated vaccines induce mostly humoral responses, tailoring mucosal and cellular immune responses is crucial for preventing influenza infections. Quillaja brasiliensis saponin-based adjuvants, including ISCOM-like nanoparticles formulated with the QB-90 saponin fraction (IQB90), have been studied in preclinical models for more than a decade and have been demonstrated to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses towards several viral antigens. Herein, we demonstrate that a split-inactivated IQB90 adjuvanted influenza vaccine triggered a protective immune response, stronger than that induced by a commercial unadjuvanted vaccine, when applied either by the subcutaneous or the intranasal route. Moreover, we reveal that this novel adjuvant confers up to a ten-fold dose-sparing effect, which could be crucial for pandemic preparedness. Last but not least, we assessed the role of caspase-1/11 in the generation of the immune response triggered by the IQB90 adjuvanted influenza vaccine in a mouse model and found that the cellular-mediated immune response triggered by the IQB90-Flu relies, at least in part, on a mechanism involving the casp-1/11 pathway but not the humoral response elicited by this formulation.","output":"ISCOM-like Nanoparticles Formulated with Quillaja brasiliensis Saponins Are Promising Adjuvants for Seasonal Influenza Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical students enter the medicine field with fresh ideas that may make them great entrepreneurs.

After exchanging the market that accounted for nearly half of the volume of the healthcare system for the ultra-low-price supply of limited drugs, what are the effects on patient and funding burdens, drug accessibility, and clinical efficacy? We aimed to verify the effectiveness of the policy, explore the reasons behind the problem and identify regulatory priorities and collaborative measures. We used literature and reported data from 2019 to 2021 to conduct a stakeholder analysis and health impact assessment, presenting the benefit and risk share for various dimensions. The analysis method was a multidimensional scaling model, which visualized problematic associations. Seventy-nine papers (61 publications and 18 other resources) were included in the study, with 22 effects and 36 problems identified. The results indicated favorable affordability and poor accessibility of drugs, as well as high risk of reduced drug quality and drug-use rationality. The drug-use demand of patients was guaranteed; the prescription rights of doctors regarding clinical drug use were limited; unreasonable evaluation indicators limited the transformation of public hospitals to value- and service-oriented organizations; the sustainability of health insurance funds and policy promotion were at risk; and innovation by pharmaceutical companies was accelerated. The problems associated with high co-occurrence frequencies were divided into the following clusters: cost control, drug accessibility, system rationality, policy fairness, drug quality, and moral hazards. These findings suggested that China has achieved short-term success in reducing the burden on patients and reducing fund expenditure. However, there were still deficiencies in guaranteed supply, quality control, and efficacy tracking.

While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students.

METHODS: 195 female athletes, nominated by 24 National Sporting Organisations as preparing for the Tokyo Olympic and/or Paralympic Games, completed an online questionnaire (MCq perceptions). The MCq perceptions investigated menstrual symptoms, hormonal contraceptive (HC) use and a preferred competition window within the MC. RESULTS: Two-thirds (65.6%) athletes reported that their MC affected their performance; in training (65.6%) compared with competition (58.0%). Aesthetic-sport athletes were most likely to perceive their performance to be affected by their MC (RR=1.40) compared with endurance (RR=0.88) and strength-sport (RR=1.04) athletes. Athletes experiencing three or more symptoms were twice as likely to identify as affected. Athletes who reported pain (RR=1.89) or the use of analgesia (RR=1.45) were more likely to identify as affected by their MC. A preferred competition window was identified by athletes as just after your period (41.5%). For athletes not using HC, this window was identified by 53.7%. CONCLUSION: In Australia, elite-female athletes perceive their MC to affect their performance, and many have a preferred performance window. Performance-focused strategies should be created for affected athletes, aiming to provide these athletes with education, and where appropriate, control over predictability, timing and symptoms of their MC.","output":"That time of the month  for the biggest event of your career!

In this article, we describe the sequence of pathological changes in COVID-19 and discuss the implications for approaches to treatment. METHODS: Standardized autopsies were performed on thirteen patients who had died of COVID-19. The findings were analyzed together with clinical data from the patients' medical records. RESULTS: Most (77%) of the deceased patients were men. Their median age at death was 78 years (range, 41-90). Most of them had major pre-existing chronic diseases, most commonly arterial hypertension. The autopsies revealed characteristic COVID-19-induced pathological changes in the lungs, which were regarded as the cause of death in most patients. The main histological finding was sequential alveolar damage, apparently due in large measure to focal capillary microthrombus formation. Alveolar damage leads to the death of the patient either directly or by the induction of pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis. Diffuse lung damage was seen exclusively in invasively ventilated patients. CONCLUSION: Autopsies are crucial for the systematic assessment of new diseases such as COVID-19: they provide a basis for further investigations of disease mechanisms and for the devising of potentially effective modes of treatment. The autopsy findings suggest that focal damage of the microvascular pulmonary circulation is a main mechanism of lethal lung disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study was performed on 40 patients with newly diagnosed HCC and 40 patients with liver cirrhosis in addition to 40 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Detection of miRNA 196a2 rs11614913 and miRNA 34 b/c rs4938723 gene polymorphisms was determined by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS HCC patients had significantly higher frequency of miR-196-2a rs11614913 CC genotype when compared with cirrhotic patients (60.0 % versus 30.0 %, p=0.013). In spite of the fact that HCC patients also had higher frequency of miR-196-2a rs11614913 CC genotype in comparison to controls, the difference fell short of statistical significance (60.0 % versus 42.5 %, p=0.18).

We provide population-level evidence on excess human incidence rates in Danish municipalities affected by disease outbreaks on mink farms and evaluate the effectiveness of two non-pharmaceutical interventions, i.e. culling of infected mink and local lockdowns. METHODS: We use information on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on mink farms in 94 Danish municipalities together with data on human SARS-CoV-2 cases and tested persons in weeks 24 to 51 of 2020. Difference-in-difference estimations and panel event studies for weekly human incidence rates are applied to 1) identify epidemiological trends of human SARS-CoV-2 infections associated disease outbreaks on mink farms, and 2) quantify the mitigating effects from the two non-pharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on mink farms in a municipality associate with increase in weekly human incidence rates by about 75%; spatial spillover effects to neighbouring municipalities are also observed. Local lockdowns reduce human incidence rates, while culling of mink appears to be more effective in combination with a lockdown. The temporal lag between an outbreak on a mink farm and a significant increase in human incidence rates is estimated to be 1-3 weeks; lockdowns and culling of mink neutralizes this effect 4-8 weeks after the initial outbreak. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infections among farmed mink in Denmark significantly link to local human infection trends. Strict animal and human disease surveillance in regions with mink farming should be pursued internationally to mitigate future epidemic developments.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on Danish mink farms and mitigating public health interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For decades, intrapreneurship has been, and is still, promoted to employees as a way to capture the creativity and excitement of entrepreneurship, albeit with more resources and less risk.

METHODS: We recently developed the TB Concentration & Transport kit for bio-safe, ambient-temperature transportation of dried sputum on Trans-Filter, and the TB DNA Extraction kit for DNA extraction from Trans-Filter for determining drug resistance by DNA sequencing. In the present study, we evaluated the compatibility of Kit-extracted DNA with Hain's line probe assays (LPAs), which are endorsed by National TB programmes for the detection of drug resistance in sputum collected from presumptive multidrug-resistant TB patients (n=207). RESULTS: Trans-Filter-extracted DNA was seamlessly integrated with the LPA protocol (Kit-LPA). The sensitivity of Kit-LPA for determining drug resistance was 83.3% for rifampicin (95% CI 52C98%), 77.7% for isoniazid (95% CI 52C94%), 85.7% for fluoroquinolones (95% CI 42C100%) and 66.6% for aminoglycosides (95% CI 9C99%), with a specificity range of 93.7% (95% CI 87C97) to 99.1% (95% CI 95C100) using phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) as a reference standard.

No data exist on the effects of lockdowns on the health status of patients affected by chronic pathologies, specifically those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Our study aims to establish variations across the psychological and cognitive profile of patients during the isolation period in Italy, in a cohort of patients affected by COPD, between February and May 2020. Forty patients with established COPD were comprehensively evaluated by geriatric multidimensional assessment before the spread of the epidemic in Italy, and submitted to a second evaluation during the subsequent lockdown. We assessed functional ability, basic and instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL and IADL), cognition and mood status. We compared the scores obtained at baseline against those obtained during the pandemic, and used mean differences for correlation with major clinical and functional indexes. The score differences from MMSE, ADL and IADL were statistically significant. Such differences were correlated to the presence of a caregiver and to the total number of family members living together. Remarkably, the loneliness dimension, more than the restrictions themselves, seemed to represent the major determinant of altered health status and depressed psycho-cognitive profile in our population. Also remarkably, we detected no correlation between the score variation and the respiratory function indexes of disease severity. The isolation measures adopted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have triggered the classic clinical string associated to geriatric isolation, which leads to a deterioration of cognitive functions, independence and frailty levels in a population affected by a chronic degenerative disease, such as COPD.

We analyzed ground-based data from >10,000 monitoring stations in 380 cities across the globe. Global-scale results during lockdown (March to May 2020) showed that concentrations of PM(2.5) and NO(2) decreased by 16.1% and 45.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline period (2015C2019).

METHODS: After analyzing the pandemic strategies of the major organizations and countries and with a literature review conducted by a core panel, a modified Delphi survey was administered to 13 experts in the fields of vaccination, infectious disease, and public health in the Republic of Korea. The following topics were discussed: 1) identifying the objectives of the vaccination strategy, 2) identifying allocation criteria, and 3) establishing a step-by-step vaccination framework and prioritization strategy based on the allocation criteria. Two rounds of surveys were conducted for each topic, with a structured questionnaire provided via e-mail in the first round. After analyzing the responses, a meeting with the experts was held to obtain consensus on how to prioritize the population groups. RESULTS: The first objective of the vaccination strategy was maintenance of the integrity of the healthcare system and critical infrastructure, followed by reduction of morbidity and mortality and reduction of community transmission. In the initial phase, older adult residents in care homes, high-risk health and social care workers, and personal support workers who work in direct contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients would be prioritized. Expansion of vaccine supply would allow immunization of older adults not included in phase 1, followed by healthcare workers not previously included and individuals with comorbidities. Further widespread vaccine supply would ensure availability to the extended adult age groups (50-64 years old), critical workers outside the health sector, residents who cannot socially distance, and, eventually, the remaining populations. CONCLUSION: This survey provides the much needed insight into the decision-making process for vaccine allocation at the national level. However, flexibility in adapting to strategies will be essential, as new information is constantly emerging.","output":"Developing a Framework for Pandemic COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation: a Modified Delphi Consensus Study in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID\\\\19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus. Patients with severe disease have a high fatality rate and face a huge medical burden due to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Hypoxic respiratory failure is the major cause of death in these patients. There are currently no specific anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 drugs, and the effect of corticosteroids is still controversial. METHODS: The clinical data of 102 COVID\\\\19 patients, including 27 patients with severe disease, were analyzed. The serum levels of total IgE and anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 specific IgE were compared in healthy controls and COVID\\\\19 patients, changes in the level of anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 specific IgE and clinical response to methylprednisolone (MP) treatment were analyzed, and the effect of high\\\\dose/short\\\\term MP therapy for patients with critical illness and respiratory failure was determined. RESULTS: COVID\\\\19 patients had elevated serum levels of anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 specific IgE, and patients with severe disease, especially critical illness, had even higher levels. Application of short\\\\term/high\\\\dose MP significantly reduced the level of these IgE antibodies and also blocked the progression of hypoxic respiratory failure. Hypoxic respiratory failure in patients with COVID\\\\19 is related to pulmonary hypersensitivity.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented several challenges and has ushered in several changes in practice such as teledermatology, with many physicians adopting virtual consultations and treatments. Performing procedures in the times of COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges such as risk of transmission to doctors and staff due to potential aerosolization, release of virus droplets during the procedures, and risk of virus transfer through the instruments both in the peri- and postoperative period. This can have several medical, administrative, and legal implications. OBJECTIVES: This document aimed to outline best practices that can be followed in this scenario to perform cutaneous surgeries and procedures to ensure safer skin surgery. RECOMMENDATIONS: Standard precautions include social distancing of at least 1 m, hand hygiene, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), safe injection practices, sterilization and disinfection of medical devices, environmental cleaning, and respiratory hygiene. It is generally advisable to see patients only by appointments. Each clinic should have a special area at entry for screening patients and providing sanitizers and masks. Procedures, which are of short duration, performed on nonfacial areas are considered as low risk and require donning surgical mask. Procedures involved with minimal invasiveness and bleeding, short duration procedures on the face such as injectables, chemical peels, and aerosol-generating procedures on nonfacial areas are considered moderate risk. These procedures need apron with head cover, N95 mask, face shield, double gloves, and smoke evacuator with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) or ultralow particulate air (ULPA) filter. Aerosol and plume-regenerating procedures (such as ablative lasers on the face), prolonged surgeries on head (such as hair transplantation), intraoral, and intranasal procedures are considered high risk. These procedures must be carried out with full body cover with surgical gown, head cover, N95 mask, face shield, double gloves, and smoke evacuator.

These pharmacological approaches may have reached a plateau in their effectiveness and newer strategies need to be investigated to not only increase the number of patients achieving BP control, but to find ways to cure the disease instead of just manage it. Since completion of the Human Genome Project and the continuous advancement of gene delivery systems, it is now possible to investigate genetic means for the treatment and possible cure for hypertension. In this review, we discuss potential genetic targeting for treatment of hypertension. There are two generalized gene transfer approaches that have been used successfully for hypertension. One is an induction approach where genes that lower blood pressure are overexpressed. A second method is a reduction approach where products of genes that are known to increase blood pressure are decreased. There are a variety of methods that have been utilized to meet these objectives, such as knockout and  knock-in animal models, and the use of sense and antisense (AS) technology. This review will focus on the sense and antisense applications, and how this technique is becoming more refined and precise through the targeting of specific tissues, the regulation and induction of components of the system, and use of other newer technologies, such as short interfering RNA (siRNA). Our lab has generally focused on the reduction approach, specifically in the genetic manipulation of components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This system not only modulates BP, but has also been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and morphology and in insulin resistance, which is highly correlated with hypertension. We will also discuss how new genes can be identified and subsequently serve as targets for the treatment of human hypertension.","output":"Current and Future Novel Targets of Gene Therapy for Hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis provoked an organizational ethics dilemma: how to develop ethical pandemic policy while upholding our organizational mission to deliver relationship- and patient-centered care.

During the pandemic, dramatic decreases in seasonal influenza virus detection have been reported worldwide. Information on the impact on paediatric influenza-related hospitalisations is limited. We describe influenza-related hospitalisation in children in Canada following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data on influenza-related hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and in-hospital deaths in children across Canada were obtained from the Canadian Immunisation Monitoring Program, ACTive (IMPACT). This national active surveillance initiative comprises 90% of all tertiary care paediatric beds in Canada. The study period included eleven influenza seasons, from the 2010/2011 season until the 2020/2021 season inclusive. Time series modelling was used to compare the observed to predicted influenza-related hospitalisations following the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Following the COVID-19 pandemic there was a significant decrease in paediatric influenza-related hospitalisations compared to predicted influenza-related hospitalisations for this time period (p < 0?0001). No paediatric influenza-related hospitalisations, ICU admission or deaths were reported for the 2020/2021 influenza season. Conclusions We show complete absence of paediatric influenza infection-related hospitalisation in a Canadian National Surveillance Network during the 2020/2021 influenza season. This significant decrease is likely related in large part to non-pharmacological public health interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the potential role of viral interference is unknown.

Because of this, we have to make sure that the benefits we get from investing in treatment A are large enough to justify the benefits forgone from not investing in the next best alternative, treatment B. There has been an increase in spending and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic that may have been warranted given the urgency of the situation. However, these actions do not bypass the opportunity cost principle although they can appear to in the short term, since spending increases cannot continue indefinitely and there are patient groups who lose out when resources are redirected to pandemic services. Therefore, policy-makers must consider who bears the cost of the displaced healthcare resources. Failure to do so runs a risk of reducing overall population health while disproportionally worsening health in socially disadvantaged groups. We give the example of ethnic minorities in England who already had the worst health and, due to structural injustices, were hardest hit by the pandemic and may stand to lose the most when services are reallocated to meet the resource demands of the crisis.

There are two ways in which they could work. Firstly, to protect the person wearing the mask, and secondly, to reduce the likelihood of the person wearing the mask passing the disease on to anyone else. This is not an easy issue to address and many factors come into play such as droplet size, aerosol transmission and the viral load, as well as the specific properties of any given mask. The method used in this study was to measure the change in relative humidity when wearing a mask, compared to no mask, in various scenarios, based on the assumption that as the virus is air-borne the smaller the increase in humidity the less the spread of the virus. The results above show that the use of a mask, excluding some simple home-made ones, significantly reduces the spread of humidity. However, their effectiveness is device specific and needs to be considered in greater detail for each type of mask, especially the direction of escaping air when forward flow is blocked.","output":"Why the mask?

METHOD A systematic search of Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, and CINAHL from inception to August 2020 to find qualitative research exploring the experience of UTI. Qualitative evidence synthesis in the form of meta-ethnography was undertaken. Findings are reported in keeping with eMERGe guidance. RESULTS We included 16 qualitative studies in the synthesis of evidence, providing data from over 1038 participants aged 13-97 years. We developed nine themes: the impact of UTI on my whole body; impact on quality of life, activities, and the associated psychological toll; I know my body and my experience has taught me when I need to seek care; worry and the transition to medicalization; antibiotics are a valuable treatment approach; antibiotics are a last resort; being heard, seen, and cared for with dignity; self-judgment; and the end of the road, a need for information and cure. These themes supported a conceptual model to illustrate the patient experience of UTI. CONCLUSIONS The conceptual model communicates the wide and varied symptoms of patients' UTI experiences and how they process this and make care decision based on past health experiences. For some, there appears to be a sense of hopelessness and frustration. This model may be used to highlight the need for improvements in diagnostic and treatment pathways.

In the Australian Federation, policy responsibility for obesity prevention sits across all levels of government and several intergovernmental institutions, rendering a complicated policy space. There is a gap in our understanding of the role of intergovernmentalism in developing obesity prevention policy in Australia. Given the complexity of intergovernmental structures and initiatives influencing childhood obesity prevention policy, it is important to understand the perspectives of senior health officials within the bureaucracy of government who through their roles may be able to influence processes or new strategies. METHODS: Document analysis relating to obesity prevention in the intergovernmental context provided material support to the study. This analysis informed the interview guides for nine interviews with ten senior health department officials (one interview per jurisdiction). FINDINGS: Several opportunities exist to support nutrition and obesity prevention in early childhood including marketing regulation (discretionary choices, breastmilk substitutes, commercial complementary foods and toddler milks) and supporting the early childhood education and care sector. This study found a widening structural gap to support national obesity policy in Australia. New public management strategies limit the ability of intergovernmental institutions to support coordination within and between governments to address complex issues such as obesity. Subnational informants perceived a gap in national leadership for obesity prevention, while a Commonwealth informant noted the commitment of the national government to partner with industry under a self-regulation model. In this gap, subnational leaders have pursued nationally consistent action to address obesity, including the development of a national obesity strategy as a bipartisan endeavour across jurisdictions. Public officials calculate the strategic possibilities of pursuing opportunities within state agendas but note the limited chances of structural change in the absence of national leadership and funding.","output":"Intergovernmental policy opportunities for childhood obesity prevention in Australia: Perspectives from senior officials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of a mutant strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with an amino acid change from aspartate to a glycine residue at position 614 (D614G) has been reported and this mutant appears to be now dominant in the pandemic.

We investigated whether COVID-Care, a patient-reported, telehealth, symptom monitoring system, was successful at delivering safe monitoring and care for these patients leading to decreased hospital presentations. METHODS: We performed a single centre, prospective, interventional cohort study with symptomatic outpatients who presented for COVID-19 screening at Austin Health, Australia. Participants were invited to take part in the COVID-Care programme, entering common COVID-19 symptoms on a purpose-built, online survey monitored by infectious diseases physicians, and matched with clinical data including date of symptom onset, hospital admission, and screening clinic presentations. RESULTS: 42,158 COVID-19 swabs were performed in 31,626 patients from March to October 2020, with 414 positive cases. 20,768 people used the COVID-Care survey at least once. COVID-Care users were significantly younger than non-users. Of the 414 positive cases, 254 (61.3%) used COVID-Care, with 160 (38.6%) non-users. Excluding presentations on the same day or prior to the COVID-19 swab, of the positive cases there were 56 hospital presentations. 4.3% (11) of COVID-Care users and 28.1% (45) non-users were admitted to hospital or the emergency department (p < 0.001), with 3.9% (10) versus 22.5% (36) requiring inpatient admission (p < 0.001). There were no deaths in COVID-Care users versus 2 deaths in non-users. CONCLUSION: COVID-Care, a digitally integrated, outpatient, symptom tracking and telemedical service for patients with COVID-19, was safe and successful at reducing hospital and emergency department admissions, suggesting a strong role for telemedicine for future healthcare delivery in this logistically challenging setting.","output":"COVID-Care C a safe and successful digital self-assessment tool for outpatients with proven and suspected coronavirus-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the reference standard methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection because of their high analytical sensitivity and specificity. Many NAATs, which use reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-PCR), are clinically validated, technically validated, and authorized by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to be interpreted qualitatively as \\"detected\\" (positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA) or \\"not detected\\" (negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA). As of this writing there are over 250 SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests that have obtained emergency use authorization from the FDA. The primary results generated by RT-PCR are fluorescent light emissions; serial detection of this fluorescence is plotted and the amplification curves visualized. Positive or negative interpretation depends on whether or not the curve exceeds a specified signal threshold. Part of the resulting process includes determination of the number of cycles needed before the fluorescent signal crosses this threshold (Ct value). In general, the more viral RNA in the initial specimen, the fewer the number of amplification cycles required to generate a positive signal; thus, the lower the Ct value, the higher the viral burden in the primary sample. Though all current SARS-CoV-2 NAATs are authorized only for qualitative interpretation, as of 10 December 2020, the FDA explicitly states that the Ct value results may be reported by the clinical laboratory in addition to the qualitative interpretation. Throughout the pandemic, many scientists, physicians, politicians, and public citizens have attempted to emphasize the importance (or unimportance) of certain pandemic-related interventions, mitigation strategies, the disease itself, and testing approaches.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ambulatory patients with cardiometabolic disease using paper/digital surveys. Variables investigated included socioeconomic status, physical activity, diet, tobacco use, alcohol intake, treatment discontinuation, and psychological symptoms. Results: A total of 4,216 patients (50.9% males, mean age 60.3  15.3 years old) from 13 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries were enrolled. Among the study population, 46.4% of patients did not have contact with a healthcare provider, 31.5% reported access barriers to treatments and 17% discontinued some medication. Multivariate analysis showed that non-adherence to treatment was more prevalent in the secondary prevention group: peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.55, CI 1.08-2.24; p = 0.018), heart failure (OR 1.36, CI 1.05-1.75; p = 0.017), and coronary artery disease (OR 1.29 CI 1.04-1.60; p = 0.018). No physical activity was reported by 38% of patients. Only 15% of patients met minimum recommendations of physical activity (more than 150 minutes/week) and vegetable and fruit intake.

Further, some individuals may be at greater risk than others for developing problematic addictive behaviors during times of high stress, such as individuals with high trait impulsivity and compulsivity. Despite the potential of such knowledge to inform early detection of risk, no study to date has examined the influence of trait impulsivity and compulsivity on addictive behaviors during COVID-19. Toward this aim, the current study examined the association between impulsive and compulsive traits and problematic addictive and compulsive behaviors during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Australia. Methods: Eight hundred seventy-eight adults completed a cross-sectional online survey during the first lockdown, between late May to June 2020. Participants completed scales for addictive and compulsive behaviors for the period prior to and during lockdown for problematic eating, pornography, internet use, gambling, drinking, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Negative binomial regressions examined the associations between impulsivity, compulsivity, and their interaction with problematic behaviors during lockdown, controlling for age, gender, sample, psychological distress, exposure to COVID-related stressors, and pre-COVID problems. Results: Greater trait compulsivity was associated with more problematic obsessive-compulsive behaviors (p < 0.001) and less problematic drinking (p = 0.038) during lockdown. Further, trait compulsivity interacted with trait impulsivity in relation to problematic eating behaviors (p = 0.014) such that greater trait compulsivity was associated with more problems among individuals with low impulsivity only (p = 0.030). Finally, psychological distress and/or exposure to COVID-related stressors were associated with greater problems across all addictive and compulsive behaviors, as was severity of pre-COVID problems. Discussion: Trait compulsivity was associated with addictive and compulsive behaviors in different ways. Further, the finding that stress-related variables (psychological distress and COVID-related stressors) were associated with greater problems across all lockdown behaviors supports the idea that stress may facilitate, or otherwise be associated with, problematic behaviors. These findings highlight the need for interventions that enhance resilience to stress, which in turn may reduce risk for addictive and compulsive disorders.","output":"The Influence of Trait Compulsivity and Impulsivity on Addictive and Compulsive Behaviors During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Past epidemics, including influenza, have resulted in increased paediatric patient volume in EDs.

Here, we examine the regulation of IFN-R1 expression and measure the downstream effects of IFN-3 stimulation in primary human blood immune cells, compared with lung or liver epithelial cells. IFN-3 directly bound and upregulated IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in freshly purified human B cells and CD8(+) T cells, but not monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and CD4(+) T cells. Despite similar IFNLR1 transcript levels in B cells and lung epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells bound more IFN-3, which resulted in a 50-fold greater ISG induction when compared to B cells. The reduced response of B cells could be explained by higher expression of the soluble variant of IFN-R1 (sIFN-R1), which significantly reduced ISG induction when added with IFN-3 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells or liver epithelial cells. T-cell receptor stimulation potently, and specifically, upregulated membrane-bound IFNLR1 expression in CD4(+) T cells, leading to greater antiviral gene induction, and inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.

Histological analysis showed 4.1% higher proportion of muscle fibers area to total area and 63.6% lower intramuscular fat infiltration in EDL sections in LPS + CS + Mg group when compared to LPS + CS group. LPS + CS + Mg group had 33.0% higher area proportion and 29.4% higher cross-sectional area (CSA) of type IIb muscle fiber. Myoblast culture results showed that Mg(++) supplementation group had larger myotube diameter. The mRNA expressions of the muscle atrophy marker genes MuRF1 and MAFbx were lower in Mg(++) supplementation group both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that Mg(++) supplementation successfully alleviated CS-associated muscle atrophy in rats at both functional and morphology levels, indicating a translational potential for patients undergoing CS therapy.

In the following case, thrombosis was located in the left brachiocephalic vein and caused recurrent chylothorax resistant to the first line of treatment and successfully treated by percutaneous recanalization using a dual approach. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old male patient with current follicular lymphoma undergoing treatment and recent history of COVID-19 pulmonary infection was hospitalized for dyspnea. A chest X-ray revealed extensive bilateral pleural effusion. Analysis of the pleural fluid was compatible with a chylothorax. Iodin injected thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed a complete left brachiocephalic thrombosis extending to the left axillary vein, with no thoracic mass. DIAGNOSES: Chylothorax due to left brachiocephalic vein thrombosis. INTERVENTIONS: Following an unsuccessful first line of treatment consisting of a low-fat diet, somatostatins and anticoagulation medication, the patient was elected to undergo minimally invasive venous recanalization with stenting. After a first failed attempt of recanalization by femoral access, we successfully crossed the thrombus through brachial access and conducted a dilatation and stenting of the brachiocephalic vein by femoral access, using a telepheric method. OUTCOMES: During the 4-month follow up, PET-scanner and chest X-ray demonstrated a significant reduction of the pleural effusion, and the patient reported complete clinical recovery. LESSONS: Central vein thrombosis is an unusual cause of chylothorax. We report a case of chylothorax complicating a brachiocephalic vein thrombosis successfully treated by percutaneous recanalization and stenting using a dual brachial and femoral approach. No thoracic duct embolization or ligature was required.","output":"Chylothorax due to central vein thrombosis treated by venous stenting using a dual approach: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to contribute to the existing literature in portfolio management and strategy by investigating the performance, diversification, and hedging benefits arising from integrating Sharia-compliant stocks into a conventional portfolio.

Harm reduction (HR) services, which aim to reduce the negative effects of drug use on health, are likely to be diminished in a pandemic. However, innovative HR interventions and messaging may also develop in response to such a crisis. It is vital to understand the most effective ways to deliver HR in pandemic situations so that guidance can be provided for current and future disruptions to service provision. Methods: A rapid evidence review was conducted with the aim of exploring what HR interventions and messaging are most effective during a pandemic type situation. Ten health databases were systematically searched using terms relevant to the research aim. A search was also made of grey literature, including a targeted search of HR messaging from key national and service provider websites. Results: In the initial search, 121 pieces of evidence were identified which, after screening and de-duplication, resulted in 60 for inclusion. The included evidence consists mainly of non-peer reviewed, pre-publication or expert opinion pieces. The rapid findings suggest that HR services should be deemed essential during a pandemic, with staff supported to work safely and social distancing adaptations implemented. Services should be encouraged to operate more flexibly;for instance, in deciding the amounts of take-home supplies of injecting equipment and medications. The evidence on HR communication was very limited but key messages on infection control, uncertain drug supply and accessing services were identified. Conclusions: This rapid evidence review identifies implications for national policy makers, commissioners and HR service providers. A person-centred rather than disease-centred approach to HR delivered by collaborating partners, as well as prioritizing tailored HR messaging, is recommended. Further research evaluating the delivery of HR services and messaging, particularly focusing on health inequalities, is urgently needed.","output":"Rapid Evidence Review of Harm Reduction Interventions and Messaging for People Who Inject Drugs During Pandemic Events: Implications for the On-Going COVID-19 Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose COVID-related stressors associated with loss of income and community are compounded with gender minority stress among trans and non-binary people (TNB), which may result in mental health burden. The present study examined the effect of COVID-related change in finances and TNB gathering access on anxiety and depression among TNB people. Methods Participants were 18 years and older (M age = 30) who completed both pre-pandemic baseline (Fall 2019) and pandemic follow-up (Fall 2020) surveys in the Trans PULSE Canada study. Multivariable regression analyses examined associations between change in (1) finances and (2) access to TNB peers and mental health during the pandemic. Results Of 780 participants, 50% reported that COVID had a negative effect on personal income and 58.3% reported loss in access to TNB peer or friend gatherings (in person or online). Depression and anxiety symptoms increased from pre-pandemic to follow-up, and most participants were above measurement cut-offs for clinical levels during the pandemic. Changes in finances and access to peer gatherings were associated with depression symptoms during the pandemic, but effects depended on level of pre-pandemic depression. For participants with high pre-pandemic depression, financial stability was not protective against increased depression at follow-up. Participants experiencing unprecedentedly high levels of depression during COVID may have pursued more TNB gatherings. Neither financial change nor access to TNB gatherings were associated with pandemic anxiety. Conclusion Findings suggest need for a multifaceted approach to mental health programmes and services to address structural barriers, including financial support and meaningful TNB community engagement.","output":"Change in Finances, Peer Access, and Mental Health Among Trans and Non-binary People in Canada During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: REGEN-COV is a combination of 2 monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab) that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of REGEN-COV in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Methods: In this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus a single dose of REGEN-COV 8g (casirivimab 4g and imdevimab 4g) by intravenous infusion (REGEN-COV group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed first among patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at randomisation (seronegative) and then in the overall population. Findings: Between 18 September 2020 and 22 May 2021, 9785 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus REGEN-COV or usual care alone, including 3153 (32%) seronegative patients, 5272 (54%) seropositive patients and 1360 (14%) patients with unknown baseline antibody status. In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and 451 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.91; p=0.0010). In an analysis involving all randomised patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 944 (20%) of 4839 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and 1026 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.86-1.03; p=0.17). The proportional effect of REGEN-COV on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity = 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: 1) To describe the bacteriological profile, 2) to identify the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pattern, and 3) to find the demographic characteristics associated with the presence of bacterial growth and multidrug resistance (MDR) in adult urine samples undergoing culture and drug susceptibility testing. DESIGN: This was a hospital-based, cross-sectional study using routine laboratory records. RESULTS: Among 11,776 urine samples, 16% (1,865/11,776) were culture-positive, predominantly caused by Escherichia coli (1,159/1,865; 62%). We found a high prevalence of resistance to at least one antibiotic (1,573/1,865; 84%) and MDR (1,000/1,865; 54%). Resistance to commonly used antibiotics for urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as ceftazidime, levofloxacin, cefepime and ampicillin was high. Patients aged ?60 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.6, 95% CI 1.4C1.7) were more likely to have culture positivity. Patients with age ?45 years (45C59 years: aPR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3C1.7; ?60 years: aPR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2C1.6), male sex (aPR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2C1.5) and from inpatient settings (aPR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2C1.7) had significantly higher prevalence of MDR.

We analyzed the scientific output related to pre-hospital emergency in the past two decades, aiming to evaluate the publication status of the literature related to pre-hospital emergency through bibliometrics analysis, and hope to provide enlightenment of trends and hotspots for the development of pre-hospital emergency. METHOD By web of science, all literature on pre-hospital emergency from 2000 to 2 October 2020 was retrieved and screened by two researchers. Excel, Social Sciences Statistics Package (SPSS, version 24) and software GraphPad Prism 8 were used to analyze the publication trend in related fields. Besides, VOSviewer, Citespace were also applied to visualize the research trends and study the co-occurring keywords in pre-hospital emergency. RESULTS As of 2 October 2020, a total of 1839 pre-hospital emergency publications with total citation of 32800 times were identified. The United States accounted for the largest number of publications (36.7%) and the highest number of citations (12825), but its H-index was fourth (20.17). In the aspects of journals and articles, Prehospital Emergency Care is the most published journal in pre-hospital emergency (256), while the articles from Smith K presented the highest citation frequency (751).

In this study, we study aggregate mobility patterns of New York City and Chicago to identify the relationship between the amount of interpersonal contact between people in urban neighborhoods and the disparity in the growth of positive cases among these groups. We introduce an aggregate spatiotemporal contact density index (CDI) to measure the strength of this interpersonal contact using mobility data collected from mobile phones, and combine it with social distancing metrics to show its effect on positive case growth. With the help of structural equations modeling, we find that the effect of CDI on case growth was consistently positive and that it remained consistently higher in lower-income neighborhoods, suggesting a causal path of income on case growth via CDI. Using the CDI, schools and restaurants are identified as high contact density industries, and the estimation suggests that implementing specific mobility restrictions on these point-of-interest categories is most effective. This analysis can be useful in providing insights for government officials targeting specific population groups and businesses to reduce infection spread as reopening efforts continue to expand across the nation.","output":"Spatiotemporal contact density explains the disparity of COVID-19 spread in urban neighborhoods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In patients on mechanical ventilation, lung hyperinflation is often performed to reverse atelectasis and clear retained mucus. We evaluated the effects of manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation on mucus clearance, gas exchange, pulmonary mechanics, and hemodynamics. METHODS Six mechanically ventilated pigs with severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia randomly received either 12 manual hyperinflation breaths over a period of 2 min (through a gradual manual compression of a resuscitation bag within 4 s to achieve 40 cm H2O of airway pressure), or 12 ventilator hyperinflation over 2 min to achieve the same ventilatory end points as in manual hyperinflation. Mucus clearance rate was measured through fluoroscopic tracking of tracheal markers. Prior to each maneuver and 15 min thereafter, we assessed arterial and mixed gas exchange, pulmonary mechanics, and hemodynamics. RESULTS Both manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation significantly decreased inspiratory flow by approximately 16 L/min (P < .001) and increased peak expiratory flow by roughly 44 L/min (P < .001). The median (interquartile range) mucus clearance rate was 1.31 (0.84 -2.30) prior to the interventions, and 0.70 (0.00 -2.58) and 0.65 (0.45-1.47) during manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation, respectively (P = .09). Hyperinflations, whether delivered manually or through the ventilator, did not significantly modify pulmonary or hemodynamic parameters. CONCLUSIONS In an animal model of severe P. aeruginosa pneumonia, neither manual hyperinflation nor ventilator hyperinflation improved mucus clearance. If confirmed in comprehensive clinical experimentations, these findings should promote reappraisal of indications for both manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation as a therapeutic technique for mucus clearance and atelectasis reversal.","output":"Short-Term Appraisal of the Effects and Safety of Manual Versus Ventilator Hyperinflation in an Animal Model of Severe Pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we propose our novel benzophenone-coumarin derivatives (BCDs) as potent inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 virus, one of the key targets that are involved in the viral genome replication. We aim to evaluate the in silico antiviral potential of BCDs against this protein target, which involves molecular docking simulations, druglikeliness and pharmacokinetic evaluations, PASS analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and computing binding free energy. Out of all the BCDs screened through these parameters, BCD-8 was found to be the most efficient and potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. During molecular docking simulation, BCD-8 showed an extensive molecular interaction in comparison with that of the standard control used, remdesivir. The druglikeliness and pharmacokinetic analyses also proved the efficiency of BCD-8 as an effective drug without adverse effects. Further, pharmacological potential analysis through PASS depicted the antiviral property of BCD-8. With these findings, we performed molecular dynamics simulations, where BCD-8 edged out remdesivir with its exemplary stable interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Furthermore, binding free energy of both BCD-8 and remdesivir was calculated, where BCD-8 showed a lower binding energy and standard deviations in comparison with that of remdesivir. Moreover, being a non-nucleoside analogue, BCD-8 can be used effectively against SARS-CoV-2, whereas nucleoside analogues like remdesivir may become non-functional or less functional due to exonuclease activity of nsp14 of the virus. Therefore, we propose BCD-8 as a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor, showing higher predicted efficiency than remdesivir in all the in silico experiments conducted.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

When predicting the environmental changes, the prediction may be uncertain, so it is necessary to verify and confirm an adaptations consequences before execution. To resolve the uncertainty, probabilistic model checking (PMC) has been utilized for verification of adaptation tactics effects on the goal of a self-adaptive system (SAS). However, PMC-based approaches have limitations on the state-explosion problem of complex SAS model verification and the modeling languages supported by the model checkers. In this paper, to overcome the limitations of the PMC-based approaches, we propose an efficient Proactive Adaptation approach based on STAtistical model checking (PASTA). Our approach allows SASs to mitigate the uncertainty of the future environment, faster than the PMC-based approach, by producing statistically sufficient samples for verification of adaptation tactics based on statistical model checking (SMC) algorithms. We provide algorithmic processes, a reference architecture, and an open-source implementation skeleton of PASTA for engineers to apply it for SAS development. We evaluate PASTA on two SASs using actual data and show that PASTA is efficient comparing to the PMC-based approach.

The characteristics of COVID-19 patients treated in local hospitals in Wuhan are not fully representative of patients outside Wuhan. Therefore, it is highly essential to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in areas outside Wuhan or Hubei Province. To date, a limited number of studies have concentrated on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different genders, clinical classification, and with or without basic diseases. AIM To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hengyang (China) and provide a reliable reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS From January 16 to March 2, 2020, a total of 48 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Hengyang, and those cases were included in this study. The diagnostic criteria, clinical classification, and discharge standard related to COVID-19 were in line with the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) released by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab specimens was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. All the data were imported into the excel worksheet and statistically analyzed by using SPSS 25.0 software. RESULTS A total of 48 cases of COVID-19 were collected, of which 1 was mild, 38 were moderate, and 9 were severe. It was unveiled that there were 31 (64.6%) male patients and 17 (35.4%) female patients, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.82:1. The range of age of patients with COVID-19 was dominantly 30-49 years old [25 (52.1%) of 48], followed by those aged over 60 years old [11 (22.9%)]. Besides, 29.2% (14 of 48) of patients had basic diseases, and 57.2% (8 of 14) of patients with basic diseases were aged over 60 years old. The occupations of 48 COVID-19 patients were mainly farmers working in agricultural production [15 (31.5%) of 48], rural migrant workers from Hengyang to Wuhan [15 (31.5%)], and service workers operating in the service sector [8 (16.7%)]. The mean latent period was 6.86  3.57 d, and the median was 7 [interquartile range (IQR): 4-9] d. The mean time from onset of symptoms to the first physician visit was 3.38  2.98 (95%CI: 2.58-9.18) d, with a median of 2 (IQR: 1-5) d, and the mean time from hospital admission to confirmed diagnosis was 2.29  2.11 (95%CI: 1.18-6.42) d, with a median of 2 (IQR: 1-3) d. The main symptoms were fever [43 (89.6%) of 48], cough and expectoration [41 (85.4%)], fatigue [22 (45.8%)], and chills [22 (45.8%)]. Other symptoms included poor appetite [13 (27.1%)], sore throat [9 (18.8%)], dyspnea [9 (18.8%)], diarrhea [7 (14.6%)], dizziness [5 (10.4%)], headache [5 (10.4%)], muscle pain [5 (10.4%)], nausea and vomiting [4 (8.3%)], hemoptysis [4 (8.3%)], and runny nose [1 (2.1%)]. The numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils were significantly reduced in the majority of the patients. The levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, blood glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, Ddimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (-GT), myoglobin (MB), and creatine kinase (CK) were increased in 64.6%, 44.7%, 43.2%, 37.0%, 29.5%, 22.9%,20.8%, 21.6%, 13.6%, and 12.8% of patients, respectively. The incidence of ALT elevation in male patients was remarkably higher than that in females (P &lt; 0.01), while the incidences of AST, CK, and blood glucose elevations in severe patients were remarkably higher than those in moderate patients (P &lt; 0.05, respectively). Except for the mild patients, chest computed tomography showed characteristic pulmonary lesions. All the patients received antiviral drugs, 38 (79.2%) accepted traditional Chinese medicine, and 2 (4.2%) received treatment of human umbilical-cord mesenchymal stem cells. On March 2, 2020, 48 patients with COVID-19 were all cured and discharged. CONCLUSION Based on our results, patients with COVID-19 often have multiple organ dysfunction or damage.

Objective methods enable to measure sphere-cylindrical refraction of the eye. If we want to prescribe new glasses or contact lenses we usually use subjective methods. The aim of this study was to measure sensitivity and specificity of some subjective and objective methods for examination of the eye astigmatism. We supposed that automatic objective refraction will be the most exact method so we choose this method as the reference method. For comparison we chose subjective methods Jackson crossed cylinders (JCC), fogging method (FM) and objective method Spot Vision Screener (SVS, WelschAllyn). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We had in total 30 subjects with average age 23 years (SD 1 year) in our study. We made each measurement per eye separately and it was independent measurement so we could use measurement from each eye (n = 60). Each eye was firstly measured by subjective method FM, followed by JCC method and finally was use objective method Spot Vision Screener (SVS, WelschAllyn). Measurement with objective instrument TRK-1P (TOPCON) was use as reference measurement. The significance level was set at p = 0.05. RESULTS: In variable FM we measured sensitivity 76.2 % and specificity 66.7 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.25 D. Result was statistically significant on level p &lt; 0.001. In variable JCC we measured sensitivity 95.2 % and specificity 66.7 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.25 D. Result was statistically significant on level p &lt; 0.001. In variable SVS we measured sensitivity 47.6 % and specificity 94.4 %. Criterion for positive finding was -0.75 D. Result was statistically significant on level p &lt; 0.001. Direct comparison of all methods showed statistically important difference between techniques JCC and FM (p = 0.0095). In other method we did not find statistically important difference (FM vs. SVS, p = 0.526 and JCC vs. SVS, p = 0.105).

However, the efficacy of vaccines has not yet been demonstrated in combination with commonly used immunosuppressive drug regimens. We sought to determine how common pharmaceutical drugs used in autoimmune disorders can alter immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination. We treated mice with five immunosuppressant drugs (cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, methotrexate, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil), each with various mechanisms of action prior to and following immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We assessed the functionality of antibody responses to spike protein and compared immune cell populations in mice that received no treatment with those that received continuous or temporarily suspended immune suppressive therapy. All tested immunosuppressants significantly reduced the antibody titers in serum and functional antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in immunized mice. Temporarily halting selected immunosuppressants (methylprednisolone and methotrexate, but not cyclophosphamide) improved antibody responses significantly. Through proof-of-principle experiments utilizing a mouse model, we demonstrated that immune suppression in autoimmune disorders through pharmaceutical treatments may impair vaccine response to SARS-CoV-2, and temporary suspension of immunosuppressant treatment may be necessary to mount an effective antibody vaccine response. This work provides feasibility for future clinical assessment of the impact of immunosuppressants on vaccine efficacy in humans. Significance StatementImmunosuppressant regimens are widely used as therapies for a variety of diseases, including autoimmune, inflammatory, and cancer. However, immunosuppressants can impair critical immune responses to vaccination. The impact of standard immunosuppressant use on the critical, developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies has not been well-described. In this study, we use a mouse model to determine how different immunosuppressant drugs that act through different mechanisms can impair the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and how modulating these drug regimens may restore antibody levels and function.","output":"Modulation of immunosuppressant drug treatment to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to compare the emotional effects of COVID-19 among three different groups, namely: health personnel, medical students, and a sample of the general population. METHODS: 375 participants were recruited for this study, of which 125 were medical students (preclinical studies, 59; clinical studies, 66), 125 were health personnel (COVID-19 frontline personnel, 59; personnel not related with COVID-19, 66), and 125 belonged to the general population. The PHQ-9, GAD-7, and CPDI scales were used to assess the emotional impact. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to measure differences between groups, considering potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Regarding CPDI values, all other groups showed reduced values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. However, the general population, preclinical and clinical medical students showed increased PHQ-9 values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. Finally, confounding factors, gender and age correlated negatively with higher CPDI and PHQ-9 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Being frontline personnel is associated with increased COVID-19-related stress. Depression is associated, however, with other groups not directly involved with the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

METHODS While mixing type/period and concentration of NaOH were optimized via univariate optimization approach, multivariate optimization approach was used to determine optimum values for relatively more important parameters such as volumes of derivatization agent (acetic anhydride), NaOH and switchable solvent. RESULTS Under the optimum experimental conditions, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were calculated as 0.03 mg/kg and 0.09 mg/kg (mass based), respectively. An isotopically labelled material (hydroxychloroquine methyl acetate-d3 ) was firstly synthesized to be used in quadruple isotope dilution (ID4 ) experiments which have highly accurate and precise recovery results. After the application of D-SS-LLME- ID4 , superior percent recovery results were recorded as 99.9  1.6 - 101.3  1.2 for human serum, 99.9  1.7 - 99.8  1.8 for urine and 99.6  1.5 - 101.0  1.1 for saliva samples.

The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the KRG extract on the ILI incidence in healthy adults. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at the onset of the influenza seasons. A total of 100 subjects 30-70 years of age will be recruited from the general populations. The subjects will be instructed to take 9 capsules per day of either the KRG extract or a placebo for a period of 3 months. The primary outcome measure is to assess the frequency of ILI onset in participated subjects. Secondary variable measures will be included severity and duration of ILI symptoms. The ILI symptoms will be scored by subjects using a 4-point scale. DISCUSSION: This study is a randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the KRG extract compared to placebo and will be provided valuable new information about the clinical and physiological effects of the KRG extract on reduction of ILI incidence including flu and upper respiratory tract infections. The study has been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings can be implemented into clinical practice if KRG extract can be shown to be an effective reduction strategy in ILI incidence.

Mutation of the opal codon to an arginine residue increases the virulence of rA774 but does not reconstruct the severe neurovirulence of SFV4. Additionally, nsP3 amino acid sequences differ between these two strains by eight amino acids and by a deletion of seven amino acids in the C-terminal third of rA774 nsP3. This study shows that neurovirulence can be reconstituted gradually by exchanging individual amino acids and is fully retained when combinations of two nsP3 mutations, V(11)-->I and L(201)-->F, V(11)-->I and D(249)-->N, A(48)-->E and G(70)-->A or T(435)-->A and F(442)-->L, are introduced into an rA774 derivative carrying R(469). The critical role of the arginine codon for neurovirulence was confirmed further by the acquisition of a fully lethal phenotype following the introduction of R(469) into a moderately virulent rA774 recombinant carrying the SFV4 nsP1 and nsP2 genes.

A CoP can be used to determine whether an individual is protected from infection, evaluate candidate vaccines, guide vaccination dosing intervals and policy, and understand population-level immunity against a pathogen. Despite an urgent need, a CoP for SARS-CoV-2 is currently undefined, leaving an evidence gap for informing public health policy and adapting it appropriately as new variants of concern emerge. The objective of this study was to systematically review and assess the evidence for a humoral SARS-CoV-2 CoP. Methods and FindingsWe searched OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Biosis Previews and Scopus from inception to January 4, 2022 and pre-prints (using NIH iSearch COVID-19 portfolio) from inception to December 31, 2021, for studies describing SARS-CoV-2 re-infection or breakthrough infection with associated antibody measures. Two reviewers independently extracted study data and performed quality assessment. Twenty-five studies were included in our systematic review. Several studies reported re-infection or breakthrough cases that occurred in the presence of robust antibody levels. Studies that compared aggregate antibody concentrations from individuals who experienced re-infection or breakthrough compared to those who remained protected did not always find differences that were statistically significant. However, several studies found an inverse relationship between antibody levels and infection incidence, risk, or viral load, and a correlation between antibody levels and vaccine efficacy (VE). Estimates of the contribution of antibody levels to VE varied from 48.5% to 94.2%, suggesting that both humoral immunity and other immune components contribute to protection. Only two studies estimated a quantitative CoP. For Ancestral SARS-CoV-2, these included 154 (95% confidence interval (CI) 42, 559) anti-S binding antibody units/mL (BAU/mL), and 28.6% (95% CI 19.2, 29.2%) of the mean convalescent antibody level following infection. One study reported a CoP for the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of concern of 171 (95% CI 57, 519) BAU/mL. As of our search date, no studies reported an Omicron-specific CoP. ConclusionsThe reviewed literature was limited by a wide variation in assay methodology and antibody targets. Few studies reported SARS-CoV-2 lineage. The studies included in our review suggest that if it exists, a SARS-CoV-2 CoP is likely relative, where higher antibody levels decrease the risk of infection, but do not eliminate it completely. More work is urgently needed in this area to establish a SARS-CoV-2 CoP and guide policy as the pandemic continues.","output":"Does a humoral correlate of protection exist for SARS-CoV-2?

Vague restaurant menus and lack of food allergy training among restaurant employees are among safety and psychosocial concerns for patients with food allergies. Multiple studies report suboptimal food allergy knowledge among restaurants staff and unsuccessful educational interventions. We developed an educational handout on food allergy to determine if this intervention would improve restaurant employees food allergy knowledge. Methods: We mapped a randomized list of local restaurants within a 15-mile radius of our office. We provided informed consent to 3 restaurant employees per location and administrated a 10-item true/false test on food allergy, immediately before and after sharing an educational handout (IRB STUDY20190975). Results: Average scores among a total of 48 employees at 16 local restaurants improved by 8.8% between immediate pre- and post-educational intervention tests (p = 1.7x10e-5). Restaurant managers/owners scored highest for both pre- and post-tests (88.1%, 93.8%). Chefs/cooks demonstrated the greatest increase from pre- to post-test scores (p = 3.1x10e-3).

Demographic and socioeconomic factors, safety concerns, and beliefs about vaccines impact a patient or parents willingness to vaccinate. The speed of vaccine development and approval, divisive political climate surrounding COVID-19, underlying suspicion or lack of education about the virus, and effects of social media are factors that may make a COVID-19 vaccine uniquely contentious compared to other vaccines. Several studies have recently looked at vaccine hesitancy specifically related to COVID-19, exploring factors such as personal experience with COVID-19, personal knowledge about the virus, perception of virus severity, general confidence in vaccines, and trust in biomedical science and health care professionals. Recently, citywide studies have shown the disparities of vaccine uptake among various demographic groups;only 33% of Black adults have taken a vaccine dose while the rate for Hispanic adults is 4%;50% for white adults, and 70% for Asian adults. We believe the emergency department provides the opportunity to investigate and close these gaps by addressing hesitancy and offering the vaccine in the emergency department. Methods: We developed a questionnaire to evaluate patients and caregivers attitudes and knowledge of COVID-19 vaccine and investigate the reasons for the vaccine hesitancy amongst patients in the emergency department. Adult patients and caregivers of children 0-17 years were asked to complete this survey voluntarily using a QR code and a link to the questionnaire. Results: To date, 66 respondents accessed and completed the survey (34 adults and 32 caregivers). Though 64% of adult patients and 81% of caregivers thought that the COVID vaccine would be beneficial to their community, many were unsure or reported they would not take the vaccine. 56% of adult patients and 59% of caregivers were hesitant to receive the vaccine for themselves and 48% of caregivers were hesitant to give the COVID-19 vaccine to their children. The most commonly cited reasons being concern about safety of the vaccine and its side effects and poor understanding of the vaccine. 90% of the adult patients and 83% of caregivers stated they would take the vaccine for themselves in the emergency department if offered, and 85% of caregivers would consider giving it to their children. Many respondents belonged to communities of color (Black 16-36%, Hispanic 73-82%), where vaccine uptake was the least.

The guidelines published by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health have also been used in this study. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have shown that the COVID-19 virus, in addition to human damage and mortality, also affects the environment, and the damages and losses resulting from this pandemic may be identified later. Water pollution, increasing chemical pollution in the air, and increasing the production of nonbiodegradable waste are of these issues. For this purpose, it is recommended that, in addition to trying to improve the control of this pandemic, other environmental aspects in disinfection methods and disposal of dry and wet contaminated waste should be done more accurately and based on standard protocols. Infectious waste, in addition to the problem of standard sanitation, will become a major challenge that pollutes the environment. Based on this, it can be said that if home quarantine is observed voluntarily, in addition to reducing the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the volume of visits to medical centers, it can be associated with another positive achievement, which is the reduction in waste production and protection of the environment.","output":"Review of environmental challenges and pandemic crisis of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral health concerns are surging in pediatric practices.

During peaks, virtual courses were implemented but these changes are poorly described, especially for oncology postgraduate students and faculty teachers. METHODS: We conducted two surveys from 06/2021 to 10/2021 in students and faculty teachers (250 and 80 responses, respectively) who registered at Gustave Roussy School of Cancer Sciences (Paris Saclay University) during three consecutive university years (10/2018-10/2021), where a major shift to e-learning was associated with COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Most students were female (53%), attending physicians (50%), of 30-39 years old (54%), and 2020-2021 (66.4%) was the main year of training. Most faculty teachers were male (58%), of 40-50 years old (44%) and had participated in training for at least three years (83%). More than half students received 100% virtual training (55% vs 45% face-to-face/mixed teaching modalities; online [84%] vs remote teaching [16%]). Only 34% of students declared >80% active listening and only 16% of teachers considered e-learning to be more suitable (compared to face-to-face) for postgraduate education. Virtual teaching decreased student-teacher interactions as compared with mixed/face-to-face (lessons were sufficiently interactive for 54% students if virtual only teaching vs for 71% if other teaching modalities; p=0.009). Teachers stated that virtual learning did not lead to any improvements in terms of attendance (68%), interaction (74%) and quality of teaching (68%). However, most faculty (76%) acknowledged that partial e-learning training should be maintained outside the pandemic, if it represents <50% of the whole teaching (teachers: 79% vs student: 66%; p=0.04). CONCLUSION: COVID accelerated the transition toward novel practices. Students and faculty teachers agreed on the need for future mixed (<50% e-learning) teaching modalities. Adequate formation and the use of codified best newer virtual practices are required.","output":"Postgraduate oncology educational shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic: results of faculty and medical student surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. The substantial morbidity and mortality associated with the infection has prompted us to understand potential risk factors that can predict patient outcomes. Hypertension has been identified as the most prevalent cardiovascular comorbidity in patients infected with COVID-19 that demonstrably increases the risk of hospitalization and death. Initial studies implied that reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system inhibitors might increase the risk of viral infection and aggravate disease severity, thereby causing panic given the high global prevalence of hypertension. Nonetheless, subsequent evidence supported the administration of antihypertensive drugs and noted that they do not increase the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients with hypertension, rather may have a beneficial effect. To date, the precise mechanism by which hypertension predisposes to unfavorable outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19 remains unknown. In this mini review, we elaborate on the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection coexisting with hypertension and summarize potential mechanisms, focusing on the dual roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the disorders of reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system in COVID-19 and hypertension.

One aim in the present work is to prove that wavelets may be a successful machinery to understand such phenomena by applying a step forward extension of wavelets to multi-wavelets. We proposed in a first step to improve multi-wavelet notion by constructing more general families using independent components for multi-scaling and multi-wavelet mother functions. A special multi-wavelet is then introduced, continuous, and discrete multi-wavelet transforms are associated, as well as new filters, and algorithms of decomposition, and reconstruction. Applied breakthroughs of the paper may be summarized in three aims. In a first direction, an approximation (reconstruction) of a classical (stationary, periodic) example dealing with Fourier modes has been conducted in order to confirm the efficiency of the HSch multi-wavelets in approximating such signals and in providing fast algorithms. The second experimentation is concerned with the decomposition and reconstruction application of the HSch multi-wavelet on an ECG signal. The last experimentation is concerned with a de-noising application on a strain of coronavirus signal permitting to localize approximately the transmembrane segments of such a series as neighborhoods of the local maxima of an numerized version of the strain.

(2020). Firstly, we find that the total return connectedness of the US commodity and financial assets is stronger than that of the Chinese commodity and financial assets in most cases, and both of them increase rapidly after the outbreak of COVID-19. Secondly, gold is a net transmitter of return shocks in both the Chinese and the US markets before the burst of COVID-19 pandemic, while stock and currency become net transmitters of shocks in both markets after that. Thirdly, corn usually receives the shocks from other commodity and financial assets in both China and the US markets during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the shocks it receives peak during this period, making it the strongest net receiver of shocks. Fourthly, crude oil shifts from a net transmitter to a net receiver of shocks in China after the outbreak of COVID-19, but it remains to be a net transmitter of shocks in the US. Finally, bond changes from a net receiver to a net transmitter of shocks in China after the outbreak of the epidemic, but converts from a net transmitter to a net receiver of shock in the US. The interchangeable roles of the commodity and financial assets suggest flexible regulatory and portfolio allocation strategies should be applied by policy makers and investors.","output":"Return connectedness among commodity and financial assets during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from China and the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 presented an unprecedented situation in which behavioural factors including tobacco use were believed to increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. The objective of the present study was to find the tobacco use pattern among the COVID-19 patients and the perceived risk of developing severe COVID-19 following tobacco use. METHODS: This hospital-based, cross-sectional, analytical study was conducted among 300 COVID-19 patients at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, India, during November and December 2020 using a semi-structured, pretested questionnaire. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed using statistical software and the results were presented as proportion and percentage. FINDINGS: About 27% and 16% of the COVID-19 patients were ever and current tobacco users, respectively. Quit attempts were found to have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. A majority (65%) of current tobacco users had reduced their amount of tobacco use. Nearly 2 in every 3 patients perceived high risk of developing severe COVID-19 following tobacco use. Perceived risk was significantly higher among tobacco non-users, patients who were aware of the ill health effects of tobacco use, and patients who had noticed anti-tobacco messages or had been advised to quit tobacco. Among the current tobacco users, a significantly higher proportion of patients who perceived high risk of developing severe COVID-19 following tobacco use had made quit attempts or had reduced tobacco consumption during the pandemic (76.7% vs. 40%; P = 0.032). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of COVID-19 patients believed that tobacco use aggravated the COVID-19 condition. Increased quit attempts and reduction in tobacco consumption during this pandemic is a positive sign for tobacco control.","output":"Pattern of Tobacco Use and Perceived Risk of COVID-19 Following Tobacco Use among the COVID-19 Patients of a Tertiary Health Care Institution in Eastern India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Propose: Troubling countries one after another, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected the health and well-being of the world's population.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider developing assistive methods for detecting and diagnosing the COVID-19 to eradicate the spread of the novel coronavirus among people. Based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), automated detection systems have shown promising results of diagnosing patients with the COVID-19 through radiography;thus, they are introduced as a workable solution to the COVID-19 diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Based on the enhancement of the classical visual geometry group (VGG) network with the convolutional COVID block (CCBlock), an efficient screening model was proposed in this study to diagnose and distinguish patients with the COVID-19 from those with pneumonia and the healthy people through radiography. The model testing dataset included 1,828 x-ray images available on public platforms. 310 images were showing confirmed COVID-19 cases, 864 images indicating pneumonia cases, and 654 images showing healthy people. Results: According to the test results, enhancing the classical VGG network with radiography provided the highest diagnosis performance and overall accuracy of 98.52% for two classes as well as accuracy of 95.34% for three classes.

MATERIALS This study included patients < 18 years old who used national health insurance services within the year 2011 and the year 2016, sampled from Health Insurance Review Agency data. METHODS We analyzed domperidone prescribing patterns including prescribed daily dosage, maximum period of continuous prescription, and number and types of co-prescribed medications and compared two different years pre and post safety warning. RESULTS A total of 16,614 pediatric patients (1.74%) received domperidone prescriptions in 2011, and 11,317 patients (1.23%) in 2016. The probability of receiving at least one prescription in 2016 has been reduced by 30% compared to 2011. Gastritis was the most common indication in both years. The number of prescriptions containing a maximum daily dosage of over 30 mg was significantly lower in 2016. In the same time period, the number of cases with a maximum continuous prescription period of more than 7 days significantly decreased (p < 0.001). In addition, from 2011 to 2016, comorbid diseases of domperidone-treated patients were similar, but the number of co-prescriptions of interacting medication to domperidone decreased (p < 0.001).

It has been observed that lethality seems to be related to the age of patients. While ageing has been extensively demonstrated to be accompanied by some modifications at the gene expression level, a possible link with COVID-19 manifestation still need to be investigated at the molecular level. Objectives: This study aims to shed out light on a possible link between the increased COVID-19 lethality and the molecular changes that occur in elderly people. Methods: We considered public datasets of ageing-related genes and their expression at the tissue level. We selected human protein interacting with viral ones that are known to be related to the ageing process. Finally, we investigated changes in the expression level of coding genes at the tissue, gender and age level. Results: We observed a significant intersection between some SARS-CoV-2 interactors and ageing-related genes, suggesting that those genes are particularly affected by COVID-19 infection. Our analysis evidenced that virus infection particularly involves ageing molecular mechanisms centred around proteins EEF2, NPM1, HMGA1, HMGA2, APEX1, CHEK1, PRKDC, and GPX4. We found that HMGA1 and NPM1 have different expressions in the lung of males, while HMGA1, APEX1, CHEK1, EEF2, and NPM1 present changes in expression in males due to ageing effects. Conclusion: Our study generated a mechanistic framework to clarify the correlation between COVID-19 incidence in elderly patients and molecular mechanisms of ageing.

This study proposes a dynamic statistical model to estimate the daily number of new cases and the daily cumulative number of infected cases, which was then applied to historic dengue fever data. METHODS: The duration between the date of disease onset and date of laboratory confirmation was assumed to follow a gamma distribution or a nonparametric distribution. A conditional probability of a case being a real case among the unconfirmed cases on a given date was then calculated. This probability along with the observed confirmed cases was integrated to estimate the daily number of new cases and the cumulative number of infected cases. RESULTS: The distribution of the onset-to-confirmation time for the positive cases was different from that of the negative cases. The daily new cases and cumulative epidemic curves estimated by the proposed method have a lower absolute relative bias than the values estimated solely based on the available daily-confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: The proposed method provides a more accurate real-time estimation of the daily new cases and daily cumulative number of infected cases. The model makes use of the most recent \\"moving window\\" of information relative to suspect cases and dynamically updates the parameters.

On the one hand, the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most common procedures used. However, many patients experience dumping syndrome or pain due to bile reflux. On the other hand, revisions after gastric banding are frequent and may be technically challenging. AIM To create a new bariatric procedure counterbalancing the drawbacks of conventional RYGB, also suitable as a redo option after gastric banding. MATERIAL AND METHODS To diminish the complication rate and pathophysiological disadvantages in reoperations after gastric banding, we primarily combined a gastric plication (GP) with a single anastomosis duodeno-ileal omega switch (DIOS), bypassing 2/3 of the total bowel length. Further on, in patients with lower body mass index we combined a GP or LSG and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with a duodeno-jejunal omega switch (DJOS), performing an end-to side anastomosis after 1/3 of the total bowel length. RESULTS The DIOS and DJOS techniques restrict food intake and bypass the duodenum and part (DJOS) or the whole (DIOS) jejunum. Restriction is achieved either through gastric plicature or conventional sleeve gastrectomy. CONCLUSIONS Similar bariatric and metabolic effects to proximal RYGB are expected in the case of DJOS, or to a conventional duodenal switch when performing a DIOS procedure.

The level of restrictions in place at the time of the incursion is likely to considerably affect possible outbreak trajectories, but the probability that a large outbreak eventuates is not known. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to investigate the relationship between ongoing restrictions and behavioural factors, and the probability of an incursion causing an outbreak and the resulting growth rate. We applied our model to the state of Victoria, Australia, which has reached zero community transmission as of November 2020. RESULTS: We found that a future incursion has a 45% probability of causing an outbreak (defined as a 7-day average of > 5 new cases per day within 60 days) if no restrictions were in place, decreasing to 23% with a mandatory masks policy, density restrictions on venues such as restaurants, and if employees worked from home where possible. A drop in community symptomatic testing rates was associated with up to a 10-percentage point increase in outbreak probability, highlighting the importance of maintaining high testing rates as part of a suppression strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Because the chance of an incursion occurring is closely related to border controls, outbreak risk management strategies require an integrated approaching spanning border controls, ongoing restrictions, and plans for response. Each individual restriction or control strategy reduces the risk of an outbreak. They can be traded off against each other, but if too many are removed there is a danger of accumulating an unsafe level of risk. The outbreak probabilities estimated in this study are of particular relevance in assessing the downstream risks associated with increased international travel.

Considering these dimensions of access allowed health care systems to dissect barriers to access to better identify ways to overcome them. In the current health care landscape, we must consider technology access. For example, patients without Internet service, appropriate devices, and digital literacy skills experience greater challenges in accessing care via telehealth.

AIM To test the hypothesis that performing a percutaneous radiofrecuency liver partition plus percutaneous portal vein embolization (PRALPPS) for stage hepatectomy in pigs is feasible. METHODS Four pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) both sexes with weights between 25 to 35 kg underwent percutaneous portal vein embolization with coils of the left portal vein. By contrasted CT, the difference between the liver parenchyma corresponding to the embolized zone and the normal one was identified. Immediately, using the fusion of images between ultrasound and CT as a guide, radiofrequency needles were placed percutaneouslyand then ablated until the liver partition was complete. Finally, hepatectomy was completed with a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS All animals have survived the procedures, with no reported complications. The successful portal embolization process was confirmed both by portography and CT. In the macroscopic analysis of the pieces, the depth of the ablation was analyzed. The hepatic hilum was respected. On the other hand, the correct position of the embolization material on the left portal vein could be also observed.

Each case was assessed light microscopically and in select biopsies spike glycoprotein and cytokine assessment were also conducted. The patients developed self-limited cutaneous reactions often described clinically as urticarial or eczematous within one day to 4 weeks after receiving the first or second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Classic clinical and morphologic depictions of type IV cutaneous hypersensitivity with features of dermatitis, interface dermatitis, granulomatous inflammation and/or lymphocytic vasculitic component were observed. Clinical and/or histologic features of perniosis, pityriasis rosea, pityriasis rubra pilaris and guttate psoriasis were seen in select cases. In two cases the dominant picture was urticarial vasculitis, possibly reflective of an Arthus type III immune complex action. The biopsies of normal skin post-vaccine and skin affected by the post vaccine eruption showed rare deep microvessels positive for spike glycoprotein without complement deposition contrasting with greater vascular deposition of spike protein and complement in skin biopsies from severe COVID-19 patients. It is concluded that self-limited hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine occur possibly due to a substance found in the vaccine vehicle such as polyethylene glycol. An immune response that is directed against human-manufactured spike has to be considered since some of the reactions clinically and or histologically closely resemble mild COVID-19.

We implemented a two-site orthopaedic trauma service, with COVID and COVID-free hubs, to deliver urgent and infection-controlled trauma care for hip fracture patients, while increasing bed capacity for medical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A vacated private elective surgical centre was repurposed to facilitate a two-site, COVID and COVID-free, hip fracture service. Patients were screened for COVID-19 infection and either kept at our COVID site or transferred to our COVID-free site. We collected data for 30 days on patient demographics, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores (NHFS), time to surgery, COVID-19 status, mortality, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: In all, 47 hip fracture patients presented to our service: 12 were admitted to the COVID site and 35 to the COVID-free site. The COVID site cohort were older (mean 86.8 vs 78.5 years, p = 0.0427) and with poorer CFS (p = 0.0147) and NHFS (p = 0.0023) scores. At the COVID-free site, mean time to surgery was less (29.8 vs 52.8 hours, p = 0.0146), and mean LOS seemed shorter (8.7 vs 12.6 days, p = 0.0592). No patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection while at the COVID-free site. We redirected 74% of our admissions from the base COVID site and created 304 inpatient days capacity for medical COVID patients. CONCLUSION: Acquisition of unused elective orthopaedic capacity from the private sector facilitated a two-site trauma service. Patients were treated expeditiously, while successfully achieving strict infection control. We achieved significant gains in medical bed capacity in response to the COVID-19 demand.

However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient volumes for a broad range of orthopedic conditions remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with changes in patient volumes of 35 emergent (e.g. dislocations, open fractures), urgent (e.g. fractures), and nonurgent orthopedic conditions (e.g. osteoarthritis, sprains). METHODS: A retrospective interrupted time-series analysis of patient volumes was conducted for 35 orthopedic conditions based on ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Patient hospitalizations and new problem visits were aggregated across two institutions in New York state, including one urban tertiary care orthopedic hospital, one urban academic medical center, and all state outpatient facilities affiliated with the orthopedic institution. Patient volumes in the COVID-19 peak period (03/2020C05/2020) and COVID-19 recovery period (06/2020C10/2020) were compared against pre-COVID-19 vol (01/2018C02/2020). RESULTS: Overall, 169,047 cases were included in the analysis across 35 conditions with 3775 emergent cases, 6376 urgent cases, and 158,896 nonurgent cases. During the COVID-19 peak period, patient caseloads for 1 out of 7 emergent conditions (p = 0.02) and 26 out of 28 urgent and nonurgent conditions (p < 0.05) were significantly reduced compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. During the COVID-19 recovery period, patient volumes in 3 out of 13 emergent and urgent conditions (p < 0.03) and 11 out of 22 nonurgent conditions (p < 0.04) were decreased compared to pre-COVID-19 vol. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the pandemic was associated with considerable changes in patient patterns for non-COVID-19 orthopedic conditions.

This paper defines a new synthetic measure of trade protection based on the value added in trade, capturing the effects that the tariff structure has on exporting firms that rely on imported intermediate inputs. The index, defined in a general equilibrium framework, provides a theoretically sound protection measurement in the context of GVCs. We assess trade protection by computing protection indexes at the bilateral level on both gross imports and imports to exports using the Global Trade Analysis Project computable general equilibrium model. These indexes are used to investigate the relationship between the European Union tariffs and integration of the Italian GVCs. In the case of Italy, imports to exports are overall less protected than gross imports with significant differences at the sector level. Despite the low levels of nominal protection, industrial sectors play a central role in explaining our results.

We therefore evaluated in vivo the safety of adding a standard-issue CBRN filter to the air-outflow port of a home ventilator, as a method for providing TIC protection to such patients. METHODS: Eight adult patients were included in the study. All had been on stable, chronic ventilation via a tracheostomy for at least 3 months before the study. Each patient was ventilated for a period of 1 hour with a standard-issue CBRN filter canister attached to the air-outflow port of their ventilator. Physiological and airflow measurements were made before, during, and after using the filter, and the patients reported their subjective sensation of ventilation continuously during the trial. RESULTS: For all patients, and throughout the entire study, no deterioration in any of the measured physiological parameters and no changes in measured airflow parameters were detected. All patients felt no subjective difference in the sensation of ventilation with the CBRN filter canister in situ, as compared with ventilation without it. This was true even for those patients who were breathing spontaneously and thus activating the ventilators trigger/sensitivity function.

Contingent valuation (CV) is a widely used approach among stated-preference techniques for eliciting WTP if prices do not exist or do not reflect actual costs, for example, when services are covered by insurance. This review aimed to provide an overview of relevant factors determining WTP for health services to support variable selection. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search and review of CV studies assessing determinants of WTP for health services was conducted, including 11 electronic databases. Two of the authors made independent decisions on the eligibility of studies. We extracted all determinants used and related p values for the effect sizes (e.g. reported in regression models with WTP for a health service as outcome variable). Determinants were summarised in systematic evidence tables and structured by thematic domains. RESULTS: We identified 2082 publications, of which 202 full texts were checked for eligibility. We included 62 publications on 61 studies in the review. Across all studies, we identified 22 WTP determinants and other factors from 5 thematic domains: sociodemographic characteristics, perceived threat, perceived benefit, perceived barriers, and other information. CONCLUSION: Our review provides evidence on 22 relevant determinants of WTP for health services, which may be used for variable selection and as guidance for planning CV surveys.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2009 to January 2010, a total of 17 patients with confirmed H1N1 infection were included in the study (mean age 30.7 years). All patients were managed as outpatients or required short hospitalization without ventilation assistance. The CT scans were assessed for the presence of nodules, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, reticulation, effusion, and lymph node enlargement. Location and distribution were evaluated. RESULTS: The most frequent manifestation was a mixture of nodules, consolidation, and GGO (5/17, 29.4%). In one case there was a focal area of bronchiolitis (centrilobular nodules with tree-in-bud appearance), and 10 of 17 cases (58.8%) showed bronchial wall thickening (findings of bronchitis/peribronchitis) and/or other abnormalities. In 16 of the 17 cases (94.1%) there were CT abnormalities with bilateral and random distribution without zonal predominance. Pleural effusions were seen in eight cases (47.1%). CONCLUSION: In contrast to several reports so far, CT findings of H1N1 virus infection in patients with mild illness are variable, including suggestive findings of inflammation involving large and/or small airways. This study showed various CT findings overlapping with other viral, atypical, or bacterial pneumonia and even cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.","output":"Various computed tomography findings of 2009 H1N1 influenza in 17 patients with relatively mild illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integration and exchange of information among health organizations and system providers are currently regarded as a challenge. Each organization usually has an internal ecosystem and a proprietary way to store electronic health records of the patients history. Recent research explores the advantages of an integrated ecosystem by exchanging information between the different inpatient care actors. Many efforts seek quality in health care, economy, and sustainability in process management. Some examples are reducing medical errors, disease control and monitoring, individualized patient care, and avoiding duplicate and fragmented entries in the electronic medical record. Likewise, some studies showed technologies to achieve this goal effectively and efficiently, with the ability to interoperate data, allowing the interpretation and use of health information. To that end, semantic interoperability aims to share data among all the sectors in the organization, clinicians, nurses, lab, the entire hospital. Therefore, avoiding data silos and keep data regardless of vendors, to exchange the information across organizational boundaries. This study presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of semantic interoperability in electronic health records. We searched seven databases of articles published between 2010 to September 2020. We showed the most chosen scenarios, technologies, and tools employed to solve interoperability problems, and we propose a taxonomy around semantic interoperability in health records. Also, we presented the main approaches to solve the exchange problem of legacy and heterogeneous data across healthcare organizations.","output":"Semantic interoperability in health records standards: a systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analyses of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region gene usage in the immune response, estimates ofV gene germline complexity, and other nucleic acid hybridization-based studies depend on the extent to which such genes are related (i. e., sequence similarity) and their organization in gene families.

We found that a single amino acid substitution, F548S, in the Ebola virus polymerase conferred low-level reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. The F548 residue is highly conserved in filoviruses but should be subject to specific surveillance among novel filoviruses, in newly emerging variants in ongoing outbreaks, and also in Ebola virus patients undergoing remdesivir therapy. Homology modeling suggests that the Ebola virus polymerase F548 residue lies in the F-motif of the polymerase active site, a region that was previously identified as susceptible to resistance mutations in coronaviruses.

This study aims to assess the mode of presentation and type of management offered to oesophagogastric (OG) and hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) cancer patients at a busy district general hospital during the pandemic. METHODS: Confirmed OG and HPB cancer patients were identified in the local MDT database. Patients were identified between 01/03/2020 - 30/09/2020 (pandemic), and 01/03/2019 - 30/09/2019 (pre-pandemic). Mode of presentation and management was identified and compared. RESULTS: In 2019, 42 and 15 patients were diagnosed with OG and HPB cancers, compared to 25 and 19 patients in 2020, respectively. 26 (46%) patients were referred via 2ww pathway in 2019, compared to 29 (66%) in 2020. The number of cancers referred routinely or emergently were 28 (49%) and 2 (4%) in 2019, compared to 2 (5%) and 9 (20%) in 2020, respectively (p < 0.0001). Patients suitable for curative treatment were 16 (28%) and 7 (16%), in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Palliative or supportive treatment was offered to 26 (46%) and 14 (25%) patients in 2019, compared to 21 (48%) and 10 (23%) patients in 2020, respectively. CONCLUSION: 2ww referrals were similar to 2019, while routine referrals reduced significantly. A marked, but not significant, reduction in patients suitable for curative intent is noted, perhaps due to delay in presentation despite the continuation of cancer surgical services.

While before the pandemic, Auckland homebuyers were willing to pay a premium for dwellings located adjacent to open spaces, such premium either vanished or became a penalty during the lockdown phases. There was also a significant premium for dwellings within 300 m of beaches. But again such premium either decreases or becomes a penalty across the lockdown phases. In addition, we find a preference for dwellings located further away from Auckland CBD.

The objective of this study is to determine whether specific antidepressant effects, estimated by drug-placebo differences, are reduced in anxious depression during treatment of MDD with duloxetine. METHODS This is a retrospective secondary pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine at therapeutic doses conducted by the sponsor in outpatients with nonpsychotic unipolar MDD, using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Anxious depression was defined by > or =7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD. Response was defined as > or =50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the HAMD. Remission was defined as an endpoint HAMD< or =7. Analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat sample with at least one post-treatment rating. RESULTS Eleven trials included 2,841 patients of whom 1,326 were classified as anxious and 1,515 as nonanxious. Change on the HAMD was greater with duloxetine than placebo in both anxious (9.91 versus 7.55, P<.001) and nonanxious (6.65 versus 5.23, P<.001) patients.

After the rapid spread of COVID-19, many researchers have investigated diagnosis and treatment for this terrifying disease quickly. Identifying COVID-19 from the other types of coronaviruses is a difficult problem due to their genetic similarity.

We also describe two features based on CpG island that efficiently detect COVID-19 cases. Thus, genome sequences including approximately 30,000 nucleotides can be represented by only two real numbers. The KNN method is a simple and effective non-parametric technique for solving classification problems. However, performance of the KNN depends on the distance measure used. We perform 19 distance metrics investigated in five categories to improve the performance of the KNN algorithm. Some efficient performance parameters are computed to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed method achieves 98.4% precision, 99.2% recall, 98.8% F-measure, and 98.4% accuracy in a few seconds when any L 1 type metric is used as a distance measure in the KNN.","output":"A new COVID-19 detection method from human genome sequences using CpG island features and KNN classifier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly around the world, with Brazil currently considered an epicenter of the pandemic.

Methods: We conducted this review based on various sources of evidence-based research and followed the guidelines of the PRISMA statement and procedure for selection. After the exclusion criteria were employed, 59 eligible articles were selected and then analysed in a descriptive overview. Two frameworks were identified in the structured content analysis to analyse these articles. One was the framework of Gilbert's Behaviour Engineering Model (BEM), and the other was the types of interventions for online AD, where 36 articles were analysed. Results and Conclusions: The descriptive results showed that most studies used quantitative methods and focused on students. The analysis results of influencing factors under the BEM framework showed that the category of environment support and tools accounts for the largest proportion.

However, research on the use of exposure therapy in clinical practice has presented mixed results, potentially due to differences in samples and training programs across countries. The present study aimed to extend upon existing research by examining the use and predictors of use of exposure therapy in a sample of psychologists working in clinical practice in Australia who treat clients with an anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: One hundred registered psychologists (M(age) = 40.60; SD = 10.78; range 23 to 71 years; 84% female) participated in an online study investigating their clinical practices. RESULTS: Results suggested that while the general use of exposure therapy is high, the use of disorder specific techniques was considerably lower, particularly for anxiety disorders and PTSD but not OCD.

The modified mask (C-PU/Si/HDTMS) demonstrated good water repellency resulting in high water contact angle (132) and low sliding angle (17). Unmodified and modified masks were characterized using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A drainage test confirmed the strong interaction between the mask surface and coating. Moreover, the coating had negligible effect on the average pore size of the C-PU mask, which retained its high breathability after modification. The application of this coating is a facile approach to impart anti-droplet, hydrophobic, and self-cleaning characteristics to C-PU masks.","output":"Surface innovation to enhance anti-droplet and hydrophobic behavior of breathable compressed-polyurethane masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To examine multilevel predictors on American public response to COVID-19. DESIGN: Multilevel study. SETTING: A national survey was conducted by Qualtrics from August 24 to September 11, 2020. The state-level variables were constructed on data from multiple sources. SUBJECTS: 2,440 respondents 18 years and older from all 50 states and D.C. MEASURES: The outcome variable is the public response to COVID-19 measured by threat perception, behavioral adjustment, and policy support. The predictors include individual-level sociodemographic factors and state-level indicators about public health conditions, political context, and economic recovery. ANALYSIS: Multilevel structural equation modeling is used for statistical estimation. RESULTS: People from states with more COVID-19 cases (? = 0.020, p < 0.1), mandatory face mask policies (? = 0.069, p < 0.05), and liberal governments (? = 0.002, p < 0.05) are more likely to respond while people from states whose economies have recovered closer to the pre-pandemic level are less likely to do so (? = -0.005, p < 0.05). Regarding individual-level predictors, older people (? = 0.005, p < 0.001) and people with better education (? = 0.029, p < 0.01), leaning toward the Democrat Party (? = 0.066, p < 0.001) and liberal political ideology (? = 0.094, p < 0.001), and have stronger generalized trust (? = 0.033, p < 0.001) are more likely to respond than their counterparts.

We performed a retrospective analysis of voluntary SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing, which was made available free of charge to HCWs of the Childrens Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw (Poland). Plasma samples were collected between July 1 and August 9, 2020, and tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Of 2,282 eligible participants, 1,879 (82.3%) HCWs volunteered to undergo testing. Sixteen HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, corresponding to a seroprevalence of 0.85%. Among seropositive HCWs, three HCWs had confirmed COVID-19. Nine (56.3%) of the seropositive HCWs reported neither symptoms nor unprotected contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the previous months. A decline in the IgG index was observed at a median time of 86.5 days (range:84?128 days) after symptom onset or RT-PCR testing. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the duration of persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as the correlation between seropositivity and protective immunity against reinfection.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens. Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants. Rhinovirus (n = 67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 39) were the most frequently detected. Co-infection occurred in 48% (n = 45) of the infants. The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs. 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs. 97%). The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value (p < 0.001). The sensitivity of the swab for respiratory syncytial virus, but not rhinovirus, was 100% in children with severe symptoms (score 11).

In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 L capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay.

Since the mandatory lockdown has been imposed, violence against women is exponentially rising world over. Several countries have enacted special policies, laws and programs to deal with violence against women in homes. However, India which since the 90s has witnessed widening inequalities since the policy of Liberalization, Globalization and Privatization has been introduced, right now is again facing the disastrous impact due to coronavirus. The pandemic is making adverse gender impact in two ways C 1) Middle- or upper-class women facing abuse in homes during the lockdown and 2) Poor women who have no homes or are surviving in slums or those on the roads walking back home or those awaiting in villages for migrant men to come back. The National Commission for Women has reported a rise of 94 percent in complaint cases where women have been abused in their homes during lockdown. Also, another aspect that has not received attention is increasing number of cases where migrant women, along with men, are walking hundreds of miles, some in their advanced stage of pregnancy along with their children, without food. Some are being forced to deliver babies on the roadside while others are receiving the devastating news of migrant men being dead while walking on roads. Deprivation and denial of health and other services to women and children during the COVID crisis is aggravating the disaster. Therefore, almost half a billion women are at risk in India due to the pandemic. Yet, the state has not made any comprehensive COVID response plan to tackle these challenges. Neither any formal statement is being issued to declare domestic violence as an essential service nor plans have been made to support pregnant women workers walking hundreds of miles without food and water with their children. Rather, the state after 40 days of lockdown, while easing down the restrictions, opened the liquor shops as a first step. In doing so, earning revenue is prioritized over genuine serious concerns of women. This is despite of the fact that the womens movement has shown evidences that consumption of liquor by men is proportional to an increase in incidences of abuse. This essay investigates the gaps in the states response in India to the increase in incidents of violence during the lockdown and argues that a robust comprehensive plan is required to address different aspects of violence women are facing in the largest democracy. The government cannot miss the chance to protect women from violence. In order to imagine a gender just violence-free world, the need is to impose the lockdown on the collective imagination that reiterate gender-stereotypical notions and to put the viruses of patriarchy and poverty in quarantine and isolation forever.

A recent study showed that aspirin was associated with improved survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who were treated with surgery. Objective To examine whether use of NSAIDs during definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) was associated with improved outcomes in patients with HNSCC. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study analyzed patients with HNSCC who were treated with CRT at a single institution between January 1, 2005, and August 1, 2017. Patient and tumor characteristics included age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol use, comorbidities (respiratory, cardiovascular, immune, renal, endocrine), disease stage, human papillomavirus status, and treatment duration. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2019, to March 17, 2020. Exposures Patients were dichotomized by NSAID use during treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures The association of NSAID use with patterns of failure, disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) was examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Survival estimates for OS and DSS were generated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results A total of 460 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 60 [53.9-65.6] years; 377 [82.0%] men) were included in the analysis. Among these patients, 201 (43.7%) were taking NSAIDs during treatment. On univariate analysis, NSAID use (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.92; P = .02) was associated with better OS. On Cox regression analysis, after backward selection adjustment for potentially confounding factors (age, smoking status, primary tumor site, human papillomavirus status, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia), NSAID use remained significantly associated with better OS (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.90; P = .02). NSAID use was associated with significantly better OS at 5 years compared with patients who did not take concurrent NSAIDs (63.6% [56 of 88 patients]; 95% CI, 58%-73% vs 56.1% [83 of 148 patients]; 95% CI, 50%-63%; P = .03). NSAID use was not associated with better DSS in univariate (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.48-1.41; P = .47) or multivariate (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.57-1.70; P = .44) analysis. NSAID use was not associated with better response to treatment (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.91-2.27; P = .12) or distant failure (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.68-1.84; P = .65). Change in local control with NSAID use was not statistically significant (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.31-1.10; P = .10). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study suggests a possible OS advantage for patients taking NSAIDs during chemoradiation for HNSCC.

However, many may have missed the rare, if not fortuitous, presence of Chinese Australians at the rallies and the heated discussions within the Chinese community on social media. Little recognition of the cross-cultural contact between Chinese and Indigenous peoples points to a blind spot vis-a-vis Australia's race and ethnic relations, a schism that needs bridging if community-wide social cohesion and reconciliation is to be realized. The key question is: why do Indigenous-Chinese relationships remain unrecognized and misunderstood by the mainstream society? In an attempt to tackle this question, this essay will look into the under-reported participation of Chinese individuals and organizations at the Australian BLM rallies and provide a critical consideration of the mixed attitudes within the Chinese community over the rallies in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. By exploring the understated support and camaraderie, as well as fractures and frictions, of the ongoing relationships between Indigenous and Chinese Australians, this essay examines the conceptual, historical and transnational factors that render the recognition of their interrelations difficult in contemporary Australia. It brings together otherwise disparate issues, including the conceptual divide between race and ethnicity, segregation history, identity politics, and transnational racism. It links cyber discussion within the Chinese community in Australia with the discourse of race in China, so as to chart the transnational connectivity of racial discourses and racism against cultural others in the era of social media. In so doing, the essay will offer new insights into Indigenous-Chinese interrelations in culturally diverse Australia.","output":"Black Lives Matter: Solidarity Between Indigenous and Chinese Australians?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), a clinically high mortality disease, has not been effectively treated till now, and the development of anti-acute lung injury drugs is imminent. Acute lung injury was efficiently treated by inhibiting the cascade of inflammation, and reducing the inflammatory response in the lung. A series of novel compounds with highly efficient inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors were designed by using 4-indolyl-2-aminopyrimidine as the core skeleton. Totally eleven 4-indolyl-2-arylaminopyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized. As well, the related anti-ALI activity of these compounds was evaluated. Compounds 6c and 6h showed a superior activity among these compounds, and the inhibition rate of IL-6 and IL-8 release ranged from 62% to 77%, and from 65% to 72%, respectively. Furthermore, most of compounds had no significant cytotoxicity in vitro. The infiltration of inflammatory cells into lung tissue significantly reduced by using compound 6h (20 mg/kg) in the ALI mice model, which achieved the effect of protecting lung tissue and improving ALI. In addition, the inflammatory response was inhibited by using compound 6h through inhibiting phosphorylation of p-38 and ERK in MAPK signaling pathway, and resulted in protective effect on ALI. These data indicated that compound 6h showed good anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo, which was expected to become a leading compound for the treatment of ALI.","output":"Design, synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies of 4-indole-2-arylaminopyrimidine derivatives as anti-inflammatory agents for acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to contribute to the analysis of expectations and belief reversals in a evolutionary and complexity economics framework.

The paper develops this analysis as a complex interaction between sets of heterogeneous expectations derived from the behavior of reflexive economic agents. Positive and negative feedback phases in a cycle are distinguished and associated with boom and bust stages of that cycle. A central role is played by agents beliefs and judgments underlying their expectations, and how those beliefs and judgments in uncertain circumstances are changeable and subject to abrupt reversals which can manifest themselves in Minsky moments. The paper argues that agents belief reversals result from their misconceptions about causal processes in booms and upswings, a misconception that reflects their tendency to think causally in terms of negative feedback patterns rather than positive ones.","output":"Belief reversals as phase transitions and economic fragility: a complexity theory of financial cycles with reflexive agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the design of a low-current, multichannel, handheld electronic device integrated with nanostructured chemiresistor sensor arrays.

However, the molecular mechanism of luteolin-mediated immune modulation has not been fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of luteolin on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), as well as the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S and peripheral macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Luteolin dose-dependently inhibited the expression and production of these inflammatory genes and mediators in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay further confirmed the suppression of LPS-induced TNF- , IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression by luteolin at a transcriptional level. Luteolin also reduced the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) in LPS-activated macrophages. Moreover, luteolin blocked the degradation of IB- and nuclear translocation of NF-B p65 subunit. In addition, luteolin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). We also found that luteolin attenuated the LPS-mediated protein kinase B (Akt) and IKK phosphorylation, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In sum, these data suggest that, by blocking NF-B and AP-1 activation, luteolin acts to suppress the LPS-elicited inflammatory events in mouse alveolar macrophages, and this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species.

We aimed to investigate the gene expression differences of the complement system in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with symptomatic PE and controls. METHODS: Twenty cases of PE patients and twenty sex and age matched controls were recruited into the study. Human cDNA microarray analysis was used to detect the gene expression difference of the complement system between the two groups. RESULTS: 1). Expression of twenty-one genes encoding complement components was detected. In PE patients, expression of the genes encoding C1q, C1q, C4b, C5 and Factor P was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than controls, while C6, C7, C9, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1 (MASP1) mRNAs were lower (P < 0.05) than controls. 2). Expression of seven genes encoding complement receptors was examined. In PE patients, CR1, integrin M, integrin X and C5aR mRNAs were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01) compared with controls. 3). Seven genes encoding complement regulators were examined. The mRNA expression of CD59 and CD55 was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05), whereas Factor I mRNA was significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05) in PE patients than controls. CONCLUSIONS: In PE patients, the mRNA expressions of complement components, receptors and regulators were unbalanced, suggesting dysfunction and/or deficiency of the complement system, which leads to decreased function of MAC-induced cell lysis in PE patients finally.","output":"Characteristics of the complement system gene expression deficiency in patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on referrals to mental health and physical health services. Method We analysed referral data from three psychiatric services in the boroughs of Camden and Islington across 2018-2020: Early Intervention Services (for patients with a 1st episode of psychosis), Crisis Resolution Teams and inpatient admissions. We also analysed GP referral data to Cancer Services (two-week wait referrals) to Whittington Hospital, Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital (all of North Central London). We examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these referrals and compared the findings between physical and mental health. We chose to use EIS and Cancer services as comparable services since they both operate with the two-week target of achieving diagnosis of psychosis and cancer respectively. Result The number of referrals to EIS and CRT both decreased to 61% in April 2020 with respect to their baseline;EIS referrals continued to decrease to 48% in May before starting to recover. Inpatient admissions saw a smaller reduction to 87% in April 2020. The number of cancer two-week wait referrals similarly decreased and reached a trough of 37% in April 2020. The rate of recovery back to the baseline number of referrals and admissions relative to previous years differed between services, with acute care recovering faster. Referrals to CRT and inpatient admissions recovered by 98% and 115% respectively by June 2020;comparatively, referrals to EIS recovered to 102% by December 2020. In contrast, cancer two-week wait referrals returned to 106% by September 2020, a rate faster than EIS, but slower than CRT and inpatient admissions. Conclusion The reduction in the number of referrals across all examined services correlated with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate of decrease was similar across all services, coinciding with the peak of COVID-19 infections. However, the ultimate degree of decrease and following rate of recovery in numbers differed across both psychiatric and non-psychiatric services. These differences likely have multifactorial origins. The authors discuss contributing factors, such as changes in health seeking behaviours observed during the pandemic, potential impact of reduction in face to face consultations in primary care, as well as temporary changes in the population demographic of Camden and Islington resulting in absent target groups (i.e. students who make up a large proportion of referrals to EIS opting to return home).

This study aimed to analyze the satisfaction of patients and surgeons with the rapid expansion of telehealth at this time within the division of adult reconstructive surgery at a major urban academic tertiary hospital. METHODS: A total of 334 patients underging arthroplasty of the hip or knee who completed a telemedicine visit between 30 March and 30 April 2020 were sent a 14-question survey, scored on a five-point Likert scale. Eight adult reconstructive surgeons who used telemedicine during this time were sent a separate 14-question survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients (20.4%) and 100% of the surgeons completed the surveys. Patients were \\"Satisfied\\" with their telemedicine visits (4.10/5.00 (SD 0.98)) and 19 (27.9%) would prefer telemedicine to in-person visits in the absence of COVID-19. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression modelling revealed that patients were more likely to be satisfied if their surgeon effectively responded to their questions or concerns (odds ratio (OR) 3.977; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.260 to 13.190; p = 0.019) and if their visit had a high audiovisual quality (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.052 to 6.219; p = 0.042). Surgeons were \\"Satisfied\\" with their telemedicine experience (3.63/5.00 (SD 0.92)) and were \\"Fairly Confident\\" (4.00/5.00 (SD 0.53)) in their diagnostic accuracy despite finding the physical examinations to be only \\"Slightly Effective\\" (1.88/5.00 (SD 0.99)). Most adult reconstructive surgeons, seven of eight (87.5%) would continue to use telemedicine in the future. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine emerged as a valuable tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients undergoing arthroplasty and their surgeons were satisfied with telemedicine and see a role for its use after the pandemic. The audiovisual quality and the responsiveness of physicians to the concerns of patients determine their satisfaction. Future investigations should focus on improving the physical examination of patients through telemedicine and strategies for its widespread implementation.

Here we compare the outcomes in paired cohorts between patients undergoing open hepatic resection (OHR) and LAHR. STUDY DESIGN Two hundred and twelve patients who underwent either OHR or LAHR from March 2004 to July 2011 were analyzed to assess outcomes. During this time period, 124 patients underwent OHR and 88 underwent LAHR. Demographic and outcomes data were assessed. RESULTS In the total patient cohort, mean age found in both surgical arms was similar, as was the mean BMI. In addition, there was no difference in the cohort between those who underwent either minor or major hepatic resections (p = 0.52). Operatively, in the OHR arm the mean duration of the operation was 234 minutes and comparable with LAHR at 238 minutes (p = 0.75). There was also no difference in the mean lesion size in the OHR (5.72 cm) and LAHR (5.37 cm) groups (p = 0.55). Notably, there was no difference in the complication incidence rates, which were 10.5% (OHR) and 6.8% (LAHR) (p = 0.59).

Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) were used to assess the association between daily mean temperature and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study period. After controlling for the imported risk index and long-term trends, the distributed lag nonlinear model showed that there were nonlinear and lag relationships. The daily cumulative relative risk decreased for every 1.0 C change in temperature in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. However, the cumulative relative risk increased with a daily mean temperature below ? 3 C in Beijing and then decreased. Moreover, the delayed effects of lower temperatures mostly occurred within 6C7 days of exposure. There was a negative correlation between the cumulative relative risk of COVID-19 incidence and temperature, especially when the temperature was higher than ? 3 C. The conclusions from this paper will help government and health regulators in these cities take prevention and protection measures to address the COVID-19 crisis and the possible collapse of the health system in the future.","output":"The correlation between temperature and the incidence of COVID-19 in four first-tier cities of China: a time series study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy is a serious side effect of natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

We hypothesized that the assessment of MR-proADM, with or without other inflammatory cytokines, as part of a clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission, may assist in identifying those likely to develop severe disease. A pragmatic retrospective analysis was performed on a complete data set from 111 patients admitted to Udine University Hospital, in northern Italy, from 25th March to 15th May 2020, affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinical scoring systems (SOFA score, WHO disease severity class, SIMEU clinical phenotype), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b, IL-8, TNF-), and MR-proADM were measured. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected for analysis. At multivariate analysis, high MR-proADM levels were significantly associated with negative outcome (death or orotracheal intubation, IOT), with an odds ratio of 4.284 [1.893C11.413], together with increased neutrophil count (OR = 1.029 [1.011C1.049]) and WHO disease severity class (OR = 7.632 [5.871C19.496]).

The time-out is an institutional and Joint Commission requirement. However, physicians in our emergency departments (EDs) document it inconsistently. We aimed to improve physician preprocedure time-out documentation for deep sedation (ketamine and/or propofol) from 75% to 90%, and separately for cutaneous abscess incision and drainage (I&D) from 94% to 98% by June 2020. METHODS: We analyzed 1 year of baseline data and weekly electronic medical record (EMR) reports from November 2019 through June 2020. Our outcome measures were the rate of physician time-out documentation for deep sedation and I&D, respectively; our process measure was physician engagement. Our interventions included education, monthly reminders and updates, individualized feedback for insufficient documentation, EMR deep sedation, and I&D procedure note optimization, and academic and financial incentives. We used statistical process control chart quality improvement rules for discerning special versus common cause variation. RESULTS: Physician documentation of a preprocedure time-out improved from 75% to 100% for deep sedation and from 94% to 99.3% for I&D. These improvements remained sustained.

Some studies show that high levels of anxiety may induce lowered Internet use and lead social media users to withdraw from Internet activities. Since the relationship between anxiety and social media use is complex, it is important to investigate mediating factors that may indirectly contribute to or exacerbate this association. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to verify whether fear of missing out (hereinafter: FoMO) is a potential factor accounting for why anxiety is associated with SMF. PARTICIPANTS, METHODS AND DATA COLLECTION: The research was conducted on a group of 264 adolescents and adults (85% women). The mean age of the respondents was M = 23.76 with SD = 5.98 (range = 14C50 years). The data were collected via online social networking among college students, their family members and friends. The participants answered the Trait Anxiety Scale (TAS), Social Media Fatigue Scale (SMFS), Fear of Missing Out Scale (FoMO), and Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). RESULTS: The outcomes showed that respondents with higher levels of trait anxiety report more intense cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and overall online fatigue. Concurrently, individuals who experience FoMO on the Internet declare being tired of social media use. Moreover, FoMO mediates the association between trait anxiety and all three dimensions of SMF, and its overall result. CONCLUSION: The present research increases our understanding of the possible role of apprehension related to missing out on the anxiety and fatigue connected to engagement in social media. It is possible to assess that trait anxiety might induce higher SMF when individuals experience a general apprehension that others are doing or having things that they do not.","output":"Trait Anxiety and Social Media Fatigue: Fear of Missing Out as a Mediator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study proposed the simulation of the inverse kinematics (IK) controller for the 7 DOF robotic arm custom designed to measure the lung condition of contiguous patients For this purpose, an electronic stethoscope will be attached to the end-effector of the robot arm Currently, no robot has been developed for this purpose In this research, the robot arm hardware was custom designed using the modular design of the motor and the Rapid Prototyping Solidwork to develop an appropriate robot arm Next, the Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation was performed to evaluate the accuracy and execution of the inverse kinematic controller for the robot arm The result shows that the IK controller has an accuracy of 0 005 mm and that the execution time was fast within 200 milliseconds ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Development of 7 DOF Robotic Arm with Electronic Bluetooth Stethoscope for COVID Patient Medical Assesment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Quantitative analysis of proteinCprotein interactions (PPIs) using biolayer interferometry (BLI) requires effective suppression of nonspecific binding (NSB) between analytes and biosensors.

To slow the spread of virus infections and better respond for community mitigation, by advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the large-scale and up-to-date data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g., disease related data, demographic, mobility and social media data), in this work, we propose and develop an AI-driven system (named &#945;-Satellite), as an initial offering, to provide dynamic COVID-19 risk assessment in the United States. More specifically, given a point of interest (POI), the system will automatically provide risk indices associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state, county, POI) to enable people to select appropriate actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life. To comprehensively evaluate our system for dynamic COVID-19 risk assessment, we first conduct a set of empirical studies; and then we validate it based on a real-world dataset consisting of 5,060 annotated POIs, which achieves the area of under curve (AUC) of 0.9202. As of June 18, 2020, &#945;-Satellite has had 56,980 users. Based on the feedback from its large-scale users, we perform further analysis and have three key findings: i) people from more severe regions (i.e., with larger numbers of COVID-19 cases) have stronger interests using our system to assist with actionable information; ii) users are more concerned about their nearby areas in terms of COVID-19 risks; iii) the user feedback about their perceptions towards COVID-19 risks of their query POIs indicate the challenge of public concerns about the safety versus its negative effects on society and the economy.

Recently, many deep learning-based Computed Tomography (CT) image/X-ray image fast screening models for potential COVID-19 patients have been proposed. However, the existing models still have two main problems. First, most of the existing supervised models are based on pre-trained model parameters. The pre-training model needs to be constructed on a dataset with features similar to those in COVID-19 X-ray images, which limits the construction and use of the model. Second, the number of categories based on the X-ray dataset of COVID-19 and other pneumonia patients is usually imbalanced. In addition, the quality is difficult to distinguish, leading to non-ideal results with the existing model in the multi-class classification COVID-19 recognition task. Moreover, no researchers have proposed a COVID-19 X-ray image learning model based on unsupervised meta-learning. METHODS: This paper first constructed an unsupervised meta-learning model for fast screening of COVID-19 patients (UMLF-COVID). This model does not require a pre-trained model, which solves the limitation problem of model construction, and the proposed unsupervised meta-learning framework solves the problem of sample imbalance and sample quality. RESULTS: The UMLF-COVID model is tested on two real datasets, each of which builds a three-category and four-category model. And the experimental results show that the accuracy of the UMLF-COVID model is 3C10% higher than that of the existing models. CONCLUSION: In summary, we believe that the UMLF-COVID model is a good complement to COVID-19 X-ray fast screening models.

Chest CT findings have the potential to guide management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective. To explore a CT visual severity score in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with attention to temporal changes in the score and the role of the score in a model for predicting in-hospital complications. Methods. This retrospective study included 161 inpatients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in China who underwent serial chest CT scans during hospitalization. CT examinations were evaluated using a visual severity scoring system. The temporal pattern of the CT visual severity score across serial CT examinations during hospitalization was characterized using a generalized spline regression model. A prognostic model to predict major complications, including in-hospital mortality, was created using the CT visual severity score and clinical variables. External model validation was performed in a cohort of 135 patients from a different hospital, evaluated by two independent radiologists. Results. The cohort included 91 survivors with non-severe disease, 55 survivors with severe disease, and 15 patients who died during hospitalization. Median CT visual lung severity score in the first week of hospitalization was 2.0 in survivors with non-severe disease, 4.0 in survivors with severe disease, and 11.0 in non-survivors. CT visual severity score peaked on hospitalization day 9 and 12 in survivors with non-severe and severe disease, respectively, and progressively decreased in subsequent hospitalization weeks in both groups. In the prognostic model, in-hospital complications were independently associated with a severe CT score (odds ratio [OR] 31.28), moderate CT score (OR 5.86), age (OR 1.09 per year increase), and lymphocyte count (OR 0.03 per 1*10^9/L increase). In the validation cohort, the two readers achieved C-index of 0.92-0.95, accuracy 85.2%-86.7%, sensitivity 70.7%-75.6%, and specificity 91.4%-91.5% for predicting in-hospital complications. Conclusion. A CT visual severity score is associated with clinical disease severity and evolves in a characteristic fashion during hospitalization for COVID-19. A prognostic model based on the CT visual severity score and clinical variables has strong performance in predicting in-hospital complications. Clinical Impact. The prognostic model using the CT visual severity score may help identify patients at highest risk of poor outcomes and guide early intervention.","output":"Multi-Center Study of Temporal Changes and Prognostic Value of a CT Visual Severity Score in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solubility is the prime criterion for determining the quality of recombinant proteins, yet it often fails to represent functional activity due to the involvement of non-functional, misfolded, soluble aggregates, which compromise the quality of recombinant proteins.

Since then, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reclassified as a pandemic, and health systems around the world have faced an unprecedented challenge. OBJECTIVE: To summarize guidelines and recommendations on the urology standard of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Guidelines and recommendations published between November 2019 and April 17, 2020 were retrieved using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. This was supplemented by searching the web pages of international urology societies. Our inclusion criteria were guidelines, recommendations, or best practice statements by international urology organizations and reference centers about urological care in different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Of 366 titles identified, 15 guidelines met our criteria. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of the 15 guidelines, 14 addressed emergency situations and 12 reported on assessment of elective uro-oncology procedures. There was consensus on postponing radical prostatectomy except for high-risk prostate cancer, and delaying treatment for low-grade bladder cancer, small renal masses up to T2, and stage I seminoma. According to nine guidelines that addressed endourology, obstructed or infected kidneys should be decompressed, whereas nonobstructing stones and stent removal should be rescheduled. Five guidelines/recommendations discussed laparoscopic and robotic surgery, while the remaining recommendations focused on outpatient procedures and consultations. All recommendations represented expert opinions, with three specifically endorsed by professional societies. Only the European Association of Urology guidelines provided evidence-based levels of evidence (mostly level 3 evidence). CONCLUSIONS: To make informed decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are multiple national and international guidelines and recommendations for urologists to prioritize the provision of care. Differences among the guidelines were minimal.

We also evaluated the CpG dinucleotide contents in SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal coronavirus genomes. Out of 1136 single nucleotide variations (~4% divergence) between human SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13, 682 (60%) can be attributed to C>U and U>C substitutions, far exceeding other types of substitutions. An accumulation of C>U mutations was also observed in SARS-CoV2 variants that arose within the human population. Globally, the C>U substitutions increased the frequency of codons for hydrophobic amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 peptides, while U>C substitutions decreased it. In contrast to most other coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 exhibited CpG depletion in their genomes. The data suggest that C-to-U conversion mediated by C deamination played a significant role in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. We hypothesize that the high frequency C>U transitions reflect virus adaptation processes in their hosts, and that SARS-CoV-2 could have been evolving for a relatively long period in humans following the transfer from animals before spreading worldwide.","output":"Mutation Patterns of Human SARS-CoV-2 and Bat RaTG13 Coronavirus Genomes Are Strongly Biased Towards C>U Transitions, Indicating Rapid Evolution in Their Hosts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To investigate the differences and relationships between different outdoor spaces of hospitals on the physiological electroencephalography (EEG) feedback (PEEGF) of staff. BACKGROUND Relieving the pressure of hospital staff is essential, and several studies have revealed that even short-term exposure to outdoor space has a decompression effect. Yet, the focus is scarcely centered on the differences and influential relationships between the PEEGF from different outdoor spaces where the staff spend time, particularly in large-scale hospitals in China. METHODS EEG measurement equipment was utilized to obtain the value of  wave (vw) that represents the stress and anxiety of staff in three different outdoor spaces: open, traffic, and rest. On the basis of EEG data, correlation analysis was conducted in accordance with the proportion of space elements. RESULTS The proportion of natural elements, such as landscape (r = -.800** p=.005) and waterscape (r = -.782* p=.013), were negatively correlated with the vw produced by staff, while the proportion of hard paving was positive (r = .817** p=.004) with more vw produced by staff. In other words, the percentage of landscape and waterscape can reduce stress, while hard paving has the opposite effect. Further, there was a difference in the amount of vw generated between nurses and administrators in the open space at the entrance of the main building (p = .043).

Agreement was considered when > 75% of respondents answered a question in the same direction. RESULTS: The response rate was 27.2% (214/784). Among the respondents, agreement for the need to perform EP in < 72 h was only reached for variceal bleeding (93.4%). Dysphagia with alarm symptoms was the scenario in which the highest percentage of physicians (95.9%) agreed that an EP needed to be performed within a month. Less than 30% of endoscopists would perform an EP within the first 72 h for patients with mild cholangitis, non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding without hemodynamic instability, or severe anaemia without overt bleeding. In time-sensitive clinical scenarios suggestive of benign disease, none of the scenarios reached agreement in any sense. Among the time-sensitive clinical scenarios suggestive of malignancy, > 90% of the surveyed respondents considered that EP could not be postponed for > 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: There was no consensus among endoscopists about the timing of EPs in patients with pathologies considered time sensitive or in those with high-priority pathologies. Agreement was only reached in five (17%) of the evaluated clinical scenarios.

This study aimed to test the series mediation model triggered by childhood trauma, in which perceived psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic and sleep quality mediated the path sequentially and led to adverse mental health outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional design involving 817 participants were enrolled via WeChat online survey. Participants completed questionnaires, including demographic features, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Pearson correlations and hierarchical multiple linear regression were employed to examine the association of childhood trauma and psychological stress of COVID-19, sleep quality, and mental health status. In addition, a series mediate analysis was carried out to examine sequence mediating effects of psychological impact of COVID-19 and sleep quality between childhood trauma and mental health status. Results: The results showed that childhood trauma is positively and significantly related to psychological distress of COVID-19 pandemic, sleep quality, and mental health status (p < 0.05). Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis shown that demographic features explained 4.4, 2.1, and 4.0% of the total variance in DASS-21, IES-R, and PSQI total scale scores, respectively. Adding childhood trauma significantly increased the model variance of DASS-21 (R(2) = 0.129, F = 126.092, p = 0.000), IES-R (R(2) = 0.062, F = 54.771, p = 0.000), and PSQI total scale scores (R(2) = 0.055, F = 48.733, p = 0.000), respectively. Moreover, the series mediation model showed that the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and sleep quality were sequential mediators between childhood trauma and mental health status (proportion explained: 49.17%, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Amid the ravages of COVID-19, childhood trauma predicts poor mental health status, in part because of greater psychological impact related to COVID-19 and poorer global sleep quality. In order to improve mental health, future researchers should pay more attention to individuals with childhood trauma, for its association with greater stress related to life events and poorer sleep quality.","output":"Childhood Trauma and Mental Health Status in General Population: A Series Mediation Examination of Psychological Distress in COVID-19 Pandemic and Global Sleep Quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The reports on adverse experiences following vaccination are scanty from India. It is important to know the real-world post-vaccination experience outside of clinical trial conditions Objectives: To estimate the incidence of adverse events following immunization with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 coronavirus vaccine and to identify the predictors for development of vaccine adverse events. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted among health care workers who received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 coronavirus vaccine. Study participants were monitored at the site for 30 min following vaccination and were followed up for 7 days after receiving the second dose, with a purpose-specific designed online surveillance form to enquire about any adverse events following vaccination. We used the Chi-squared test for categorical variables and multivariate regression analysis to identify predictors for the development of vaccine adverse effects. RESULTS Of 411 participants, the mean age was 30.77  12.5 years and 76.2% were females. Overall, 207 (50.4%) respondents reported at least one post-vaccination symptom receiving either dose of coronavirus vaccination. Fever (34.8%), local pain at the injection site (28.0%), tiredness (25.5%), chills (20%), myalgia (18.7%), headache (17.8%), injection site stiffness (5.4%), joint pain (4.6%) and nausea-vomiting (3.8%) were the most prevalent symptoms following the first dose. Adverse reactions reported after the second dose were milder and less frequent. Post-vaccination symptoms were more likely in the younger age group, those with comorbidity particularly, bronchial asthma and who had a history of allergy to food/drugs. CONCLUSION All the adverse reactions were of a minor type and non-serious. Side effects were less common in older adults (>60 years). Reactions to the second dose were lesser in intensity and frequency. Younger age, history of allergy, and comorbidities, particularly asthma were found to be major predictors for the development of adverse events and require more watchful vaccine administration.","output":"Active Symptom-Based Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Immunization among Individuals Vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Coronavirus Vaccine in a Tertiary Hospital of Kerala."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has remarkably impacted the hospital management and the profile of patients suffering from acute cardiovascular syndromes.

METHODS Thirteen prenatally diagnosed CC patients from 1997 to 2015 were included. Seven patients (1997-2008) underwent open surgery (OS group), and 6 (2009-2015) underwent laparoscopic surgery (LS group). In the asymptomatic patients, LS was performed when the patients weighed over 5 kg. When the patient had clinical manifestations, early LS was performed irrespective of body weight. A retrospective comparison was conducted between the LS and OS groups in terms of the operative time, blood loss, postoperative fasting period, hospital stay, and intra- and postoperative complications. RESULTS There was no difference between the demographics of both groups. The operative time was significantly longer (380 vs. 288 min) and blood loss was significantly lower (4 vs. 30 mL) in the LS group. Additionally, the postoperative fasting period (3 vs. 6 days) and hospital stay (11 vs. 20 days) were significantly shorter in the LS group. Intraoperative events and early postoperative complications were not encountered in either group. Small bowel obstruction requiring surgery occurred in two patients, 10 and 13 years after OS, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an association therapy of hydroxychloroquine (HY) plus ritonavir/darunavir (RD) or azithromycin (AZ) on QTc intervals. METHODS: At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic patients admitted to our hospital were treated with the empiric association of HY/RD; one week later the therapeutic protocol was modified with the combination of HY/AZ. Patients underwent an ECG at baseline, then 3 and 7 days after starting therapy. We prospectively enrolled 113 patients (61 in the HY/RD group-52 in the HY/AZ group). RESULTS: A significant increase in median QTc was reported after seven days of therapy in both groups: from 438 to 452 ms in HY/RD patients; from 433 to 440 ms in HY/AZ patients (p = 0.001 for both). 23 patients (21.2%) had a QTc > 500 ms at 7 days. The risk of developing a QTc > 500 ms was greater in patients with prolonged baseline QTc values (&#8805; 440 ms for female and &#8805; 460 ms for male patients) (OR 7.10 (95% IC 1.88-26.81); p = 0.004) and in patients with an increase in the QTc > 40 ms 3 days after onset of treatment (OR 30.15 (95% IC 6.96-130.55); p = 0.001).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: this randomized, single-blind, controlled two-period crossover trial will involve about 150 outpatients with NCDs (N=40 with Chronic Heart Failure - CHF, N=60 with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - COPD, and N=50 with Parkinson's Disease - PD) from the rehabilitation units of IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi of Milan. Each participant will experience, consequently, two different types of interventions: rehabilitation with the SIDERA^B system (SIDERA^B - S), which allow for both tele-rehabilitation activities and tele-monitoring of vital parameters, and rehabilitation as usual (Usual Care - U) including a manual of rehabilitative exercises and self-monitoring of vital parameters. INTERVENTIONS: subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two specified sequences of interventions: U/S/U (the USU group), and S/U (the SU group).

However, the development of adequate, affordable, and accessible treatments is mostly neglected, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality that could otherwise be averted. Leishmaniasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan Leishmania parasite and transmitted by the bite of infected phlebotomine sandflies. No systematic review and meta-analysis has been done to identify the prevalence and risk factors of leishmaniasis to the authors knowledge. Therefore, the objective was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of human leishmaniasis in Ethiopia. METHODS: Eleven studies conducted in all regions of Ethiopia, which were fully accessible, written in any language, and original articles done on prevalence and risk factors of leishmaniasis, were included. STATA? version 11.1 was used for statistical analysis. Chi-square, I(2), and p values were assessed to check heterogeneity. A random effects model with heterogeneity taken from an inverse-variance model was employed to estimate the pooled effect. Subgroup meta-analysis was computed to reduce random variations among each articles point prevalence, and Egger and funnel plots were used to check for publication bias. RESULTS: The highest proportion of human leishmaniasis was reported from a study done in Amhara region (39.1%), and the lowest was reported from a survey done in Tigray (2.3%). The overall pooled prevalence of leishmaniasis was 9.13% (95% CI 5C13.27).

The current study aims to test a multiple mediation model to examine the role of Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) and emotional regulation (i.e., expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal) as joint factors, which can increase understanding of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 outbreak. An online survey measuring fear of COVID-19, IU, emotional regulation, and psychological distress was administered to 3863 Italian adults (females 73.3%;Mage = 36.44;SD = 14.74) during lockdown. Results showed that IU partially mediated the effect of fear of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress. Moreover, individuals with difficulties in managing the uncertainties due to their fear of COVID-19 may be at risk for heightened use of expressive suppression and depression. However, individuals with both higher IU and expressive suppression showed lower level of stress. High cognitive reappraisal has a mediational effect on the relationship between fear of COVID-19, IU, and lower psychological distress. Findings suggest that IU and emotional regulation should be targeted for informing the development of tailored treatments to reduce the negative consequences of the outbreak.

Almost 85% of PLWH with confirmed COVID-19 had a comorbidity associated with severe disease, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension. Approximately 77% of PLWH with COVID-19 were non-Hispanic Black or Latinx whereas only 40% of the PLWH in our clinic were Black or Latinx. Nearly half of PLWH with COVID-19 had exposure to congregate settings. In addition to people with confirmed COVID-19, we identified another 11 individuals with probable COVID-19, almost all of whom had negative PCR testing. CONCLUSION: In the largest cohort to date of PLWH and confirmed COVID-19, almost all had a comorbidity associated with severe disease, highlighting the importance of non-HIV risk factors in this population. The racial disparities and frequent link to congregate settings in PLWH and COVID-19 need to be explored urgently.","output":"Disproportionate burden of coronavirus disease 2019 among racial minorities and those in congregate settings among a large cohort of people with HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The artery of Percheron is a small vessel whose occlusion causes bilateral paramedian thalamic and rostral midbrain stroke.

This study describes the development of a COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (COVKAP) Survey among U.S. student pharmacists. The survey was administered at Doctor of Pharmacy programs in three statesTennessee, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Methods: The COVKAP surveyan online cross-sectional surveywas distributed to U.S. student pharmacists enrolled in three different colleges of pharmacy in three states during the fall semester of 2020. The survey was developed using literature review and Dillmans recommendations for survey design. The COVKAP survey consisted of 23 closed and Likert-scale questions, and three open-ended questions. The research team conducted descriptive and inductive thematic analyses on the quantitative and qualitative data, respectively using SPSS (v27) and Dedoose(?) software. Results: A total of 421 responses were received. Respondents were predominantly female (72%) and White (79%). The average age of respondents was 23.4 years. The qualitative analysis revealed three themes: (1) Wellbeing and mental health struggles; (2) Being part of the decision-making process; (3) Necessity of adequate protection measures. Conclusions: Preliminary study findings indicate that student pharmacists concerns and the challenges that they face in their academic pursuits are largely similar across the three states in this study and inform about the importance of recognizing and mitigating the impact of widespread disruption in education. This disruption provides an opportunity for pharmacy academia to examine practices and methods that can be improved upon to help students become successful practitioners.","output":"Student Pharmacists during the Pandemic: Development of a COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (COVKAP) Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infectious diseases remain a major challenge for human health Following the emergence of a new coronavirus pneumonia, more than 10,000 species of wild viruses have been mentioned by mass media, but only a few are well recognized In recent decades, human beings have constantly faced the challenge of bacterial and viral infections The most common pathogens of new infectious diseases are viruses, the latest being COVID-19 Therefore, we should pay close attention to the severity of respiratory virus infection There are many common viruses that can cause respiratory infections, including influenza-related viruses, human metapneumovirus, measles virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, respiratory tract syncytial virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, etc In particular, there are more than 100 species of coronaviruses","output":"Chapter 1 - Respiratory virus and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To examine how the coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) pandemic and its consequences may have influenced suicide in Victoria, Australia.

Outcomes were the rate of respiratory tract infections (RTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among patients receiving vedolizumab as compared with placebo. Pooled rates were reported as Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Eight RCT involving 3,287 patients (1873 CD and 1415 UC) were analyzed; 2,493 patients received vedolizumab and 794 received placebo. The rates of RTI and URTI were statistically higher in vedolizumab-treated patients compared to placebo [OR = 1.63; 95% CI (1.07C2.49); OR = 1.64 95% CI (1.07C2.53) respectively].

In 1999, the Nipah virus outbreak killed 105 Malaysians, while the SARS outbreak of 2003 claimed only 2 lives. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has so far claimed over 100 Malaysian lives. There were two waves of the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. First wave of 22 cases occurred from January 25 to February 15 with no death and full recovery of all cases. The ongoing second wave, which commenced on February 27, presented cases in several clusters, the biggest of which was the Sri Petaling Tabligh cluster with an infection rate of 6.5%, and making up 47% of all cases in Malaysia. Subsequently, other clusters appeared from local mass gatherings and imported cases of Malaysians returning from overseas. Healthcare workers carry high risks of infection due to the daily exposure and management of COVID-19 in the hospitals. However, 70% of them were infected through community transmission and not while handling patients. In vulnerable groups, the incidence of COVID-19 cases was highest among the age group 55 to 64 years. In terms of fatalities, 63% were reported to be aged above 60 years, and 81% had chronic comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. The predominant COVID-19 strain in Malaysia is strain B, which is found exclusively in East Asia. However, strain A, which is mostly found in the USA and Australia, and strain C in Europe were also present. To contain the epidemic, Malaysia implemented a Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning on March 18 in 4 phases over 2 months, ending on May 12. In terms of economic impacts, Malaysia lost RM2.4 billion a day during the MCO period, with an accumulated loss of RM63 billion up to the end of April. Since May 4, Malaysia has relaxed the MCO and opened up its economic sector to relieve its economic burden. Currently, the best approach to achieving herd immunity to COVID-19 is through vaccination rather than by acquiring it naturally. There are at least two candidate vaccines which have reached the final stage of human clinical trials. Malaysia's COVID-19 case fatality rate is lower than what it is globally; this is due to the successful implementation of early preparedness and planning, the public health and hospital system, comprehensive contact tracing, active case detection, and a strict enhanced MCO.","output":"COVID-19 Epidemic in Malaysia: Epidemic Progression, Challenges, and Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease worldwide.

Inonotus obliquus (IO), a folk medicinal fungus, has long been used to prevent against metabolic syndrome related diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, etc. However, the study of IO anti-NAFLD effect has been reported rarely. This study aimed to investigate whether IO has an inhibitory effect on NAFLD, identify the active compounds in IO and clarify the underlying mechanisms of its anti-NAFLD effects. The results of Oil Red O(ORO) and Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining, lipid extraction and determination showed that IO and its extracts, including inotodiol (Ino), lanosterol (Lan) and trametenolic acid (TA), could remarkably ameliorate lipid accumulation in MCD diet-induced mouse livers or OA-induced LO2 hepatocytes. Moreover, qPCR analysis revealed that IO and its compounds significantly downregulated the mRNA levels of lipogenic genes, such as SREBP-1c, ACC1 and FASN, and upregulated the mRNA levels of FXR and SHP. We found that the administration of guggulsterone (GS), a FXR inhibitor, abolished the inhibitory effect of Ino on lipid deposition in OA-induced LO2 cells. In conclusion, IO and its compounds attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD by inhibiting liver lipogenesis. The anti-NAFLD effects of Ino, a bioactive compound in IO, are through regulating FXR/SHP/SREBP-1c pathway.

The oral microbiome includes different types of microbes such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. Numerous factors can affect the equilibrium of the oral microbiome community which can eventually lead to orodental infectious diseases. Periodontitis, dental caries, oral leukoplakia, oral squamous cell carcinoma are some multifactorial infectious diseases in the oral cavity. In defending against infection, the immune system has an essential role. Depending on the speed and specificity of the reaction, immunity is divided into two different types which are named the innate and the adaptive responses but also there is much interaction between them. In these responses, different types of immune cells are present and recent evidence demonstrates that these cell types both within the innate and adaptive immune systems are capable of secreting some extracellular vesicles named exosomes which are involved in the response to infection. Exosomes are 30C150 nm lipid bilayer vesicles that consist of variant molecules, including proteins, lipids, and genetic materials and they have been associated with cell-to-cell communications. However, some kinds of exosomes can be effective on the pathogenicity of various microorganisms and promoting infections, and some other ones have antimicrobial and anti-infective functions in microbial diseases. These discrepancies in performance are due to the origin of the exosome. Exosomes can modulate the innate and specific immune responses of host cells by participating in antigen presentation for activation of immune cells and stimulating the release of inflammatory factors and the expression of immune molecules. Also, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes participate in immunomodulation by different mechanisms. Ease of expansion and immunotherapeutic capabilities of MSCs, develop their applications in hundreds of clinical trials. Recently, it has been shown that cell-free therapies, like exosome therapies, by having more advantages than previous treatment methods are emerging as a promising strategy for the treatment of several diseases, in particular inflammatory conditions. In orodental infectious disease, exosomes can also play an important role by modulating immunoinflammatory responses. Therefore, MSCs-derived exosomes may have potential therapeutic effects to be a choice for controlling and treatment of orodental infectious diseases.","output":"Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells-Derived Exosomes as an Antimicrobial Weapon for Orodental Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of death in the western world with an estimated number of 275 000 treated with resuscitation attempts by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in Europe each year.

Barriers to the initiation of CPR by bystanders in OHCA include fear of being incapable, causing harm, and transmission of infectious diseases. Partly due to these barriers, and low rates of CPR, the concept of CPR with compression only was proposed as a simpler form of resuscitation with the aim to be more widely accepted by the public in the 1990s.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. The trial included 50 aphasic patients. They were randomized into either group I or group II to receive 48 therapy sessions using the Arabic software program (group I) or the conventional therapy (group II). The primary outcome was a measure of improvement in language abilities. It was measured using the Arabic version of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination to detect any significant improvement in the language of both groups in comparison to pre-therapy results. The post-therapy results of both groups were compared to each other to document the effectiveness of the software program.

Methods: An age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population. Results: The enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve, reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively.

This trial investigated whether MOSAIC improved walking performance compared to usual care in adults with peripheral arterial disease. Methods: This multicentre, parallel group, two-arm, randomised, controlled superiority trial enrolled participants from six NHS Trusts between January 2018 and March 2020. Inclusion criteria comprised: aged 50 years with established peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication. Exclusion criteria included: unstable disease;walking >90 min/week;contraindications to exercise or completed/offered any medically supervised exercise in previous/upcoming six-months. The primary outcome was six-minute walk distance (6MWD, metres (m)) at three-months (clinically meaningful change: 8 m). Secondary outcomes included pain-free walking distance measured during six-minute walk test (PFWD, seconds), self-reported walking limitation (Walking Estimated-Limitation Calculated by History, WELCH, range 0C100;self-reported maximum walking distance, SR-MWD (m)), activities of daily living (Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire, NEADL, range 0C66), and quality of life (Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire-6, VASuQoL-6, range 6C24). All measures were collected at baseline and three-months by an assessor masked to participant allocation. The self-reported outcomes were also collected at six-months. Consenting participants were randomly assigned (by King's Clinical Trials Unit remote computer-generated randomisation system) to receive either MOSAIC (two face-to-face and two telephone consultations delivered over three-months by trained physiotherapists, a pedometer and a bespoke manual) or usual care. Participants and physiotherapists were not masked to group allocation. Participant recruitment and collection of primary outcome data at three-months was ceased early due to COVID-19 restrictions. All self-reported six-month outcomes were collected as per protocol. Outcomes were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis using multiple regression with baseline value and stratification factors as covariates. Results: 190 participants (mean age (Standard Deviation) 68 (9) years, 57 (30%) female, 150 (79%) White) were recruited (95/group). At three-months, participants receiving MOSAIC had greater mean 6MWD compared to participants receiving usual care (adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 16.4 m (3.8, 29.1)). Secondary outcomes also indicated greater improvement for those receiving MOSAIC than usual care (adjusted mean differences (95% CI): PFWD (31.2 s (6.3, 56.0));WELCH (10.2 points (5.6, 14.8));SR-MWD (251 s (11.0;194.9));NEADL (2.8 points (0.1;5.4));VASuQoL-6 (0.6 points (?0.2;1.4)). At six months, there was a sustained improvement in WELCH in participants receiving MOSAIC compared to usual care (adjusted mean difference (95% CI): 7.4 points (2.5, 1.3)). Results for the other secondary outcomes were inconclusive (SR-MWD (309.9 s (?17.8;637.6)), NEADL (?1.6 points (?4.6, 1.5)), VASuQoL-6 (0.6 points (?0.4;1.6)).

At the same temperature and mass fraction of methanol (n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane), the mole fraction solubility of ribavirin is greater in (methanol + water) than in the other three solvent mixtures. The preferential solvation parameters were derived from their thermodynamic solution properties by means of the inverse KirkwoodCBuff integrals. The preferential solvation parameters for methanol, n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane (x(1,3)) were negative in the four solvent mixtures with a very wide compositions, which indicated that ribavirin was preferentially solvated by water. Temperature had little effect on the preferential solvation magnitudes. The higher solvation by water could be explained in terms of the higher acidic behaviour of water interacting with the Lewis basic groups of the ribavirin. Besides, the solubility of the drugs was mathematically represented by using the Jouyban-Acree model, vant Hoff-Jouyban-Acree model and Apelblat-Jouyban-Acree model obtaining average relative deviations lower than 1.57% for correlative studies. It is noteworthy that the solubility data presented in this work contribute to expansion of the physicochemical information about the solubility of drugs in binary solvent mixtures and also allows the thermodynamic analysis of the respective dissolution and specific solvation process.","output":"Thermodynamic modelling of solubility and preferential solvation for ribavirin (II) in co-solvent mixtures of (methanol, n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane) + water"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral (RV) infections represent a major threat for human health worldwide.

The aim of this prospective birth cohort study was to identify risk factors for an hMPV or RSV infection during the first year of life in unselected healthy children. We followed 217 children from birth to 1 year of age. Nasal swabs and symptom diaries were collected monthly. Anti-hMPV and anti-RSV IgG antibodies by age 1 year were detected by ELISA, and nasal swabs were analysed for hMPV and RSV by RT-PCR. Logistic regression was used for risk factor analysis. Anti-hMPV IgG was found in 38 children (17.5%), and anti-RSV IgG in 172 children (79%). Risk factors for being anti-hMPV IgG-positive were: (1) being born in the spring (OR = 2.36; 95% CI:1.06C5.27), and (2) having older siblings (OR = 3.82; 95% CI:1.75C8.34).

Among individuals with co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and residing in rural communities, adherence is essential as they are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and increased disease severity. Objective: This study aims to explore factors influencing adherence to evidence-based recommendations for preventing COVID-19 among patients/family caregivers with CVD in rural Central Appalachia. Methods: During March-April 2020, 102 CVD Stakeholders-patients/family caregivers, community leaders, and providers from six states across Appalachia participated in a survey administered through RED Cap. This study used a subsample (n=73) that excluded providers. Adherence score was defined as the rate of compliance with health authorities' guidelines, including hand washing, physical distancing, staying home if sick, wearing a face mask, disinfecting and cleaning daily, and cough and sneezing etiquette. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed to examine associations between adherence scores and variables of interest. Results: Over half (53.42%) of participants complied with all guidelines. Gender, employmentstatus, hypertension, smoking, no insurance, getting information about COVID-19 from Government/CDC website, and getting information about COVID-19 from worship place/club were significantly associated with adherence to CDC recommendations (p&lt;0.05). Compared to lowpersonal perception of threat (PPT), having no and high PPT were associated with lower and higheradherence scores, respectively (=-2.32, 1.42;p=0.001). Compared to low perception of COVID-19threat towards family/friends, having moderate or high perception of COVID-19 threat to wardfamily/friends was associated with improved adherence (= 1.3, 1.57;p&lt;0.05 for both), whereashaving no perception was negatively associated with adherence (=-2.08, p=0.003).

A retrospective analysis of ICV detections to week 26/2019 revealed persistent low-level circulation with outbreaks occurring biennially in the winters of 2015 to 2016 and 2017 to 2018 (R. S. Daniels et al., J Virol 94:e01051-20, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01051-20). Here, we report on an outbreak occurring in 2019 to 2020, reinforcing the observation of biennial seasonality in Hong Kong. All three outbreaks occurred in similar time frames, were subsequently dwarfed by seasonal epidemics of influenza types A and B, and were caused by similar proportions of C/Kanagawa/1/76 (K)-lineage and C/S?o Paulo/378/82 S1- and S2-sublineage viruses. Ongoing genetic drift was observed in all genes, with some evidence of amino acid substitution in the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) glycoprotein possibly associated with antigenic drift. A total of 61 ICV genomes covering the three outbreaks were analyzed for reassortment, and 9 different reassortant constellations were identified, 1 K-lineage, 4 S1-sublineage, and 4 S2-sublineage, with 6 of these being identified first in the 2019C1920 outbreak (2 S2-lineage and 4 S1-lineage). The roles that virus interference/enhancement, ICV persistent infection, genome evolution, and reassortment might play in the observed seasonality of ICV in Hong Kong are discussed. IMPORTANCE Influenza C virus (ICV) infection of humans is common, with the great majority of people being infected during childhood, though reinfection can occur throughout life. While infection normally results in cold-like symptoms, severe disease cases have been reported in recent years. However, knowledge of ICV is limited due to poor systematic surveillance and an inability to propagate the virus in large amounts in the laboratory. Following recent systematic surveillance in Hong Kong SAR, China, and direct ICV gene sequencing from clinical specimens, a 2-year cycle of disease outbreaks (epidemics) has been identified, with gene mixing playing a significant role in ICV evolution. Studies like those reported here are key to developing an understanding of the impact of influenza C virus infection in humans, notably where comorbidities exist and severe respiratory disease can develop.","output":"Temporal and Gene Reassortment Analysis of Influenza C Virus Outbreaks in Hong Kong, SAR, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we propose a novel and practical mechanism which enables the service provider to verify whether a suspect model is stolen from the victim model via model extraction attacks.

UAPs belong to a low-dimensional subspace and piracy models' subspaces are more consistent with victim model's subspace compared with non-piracy model. Based on this, we propose a UAP fingerprinting method for DNN models and train an encoder via contrastive learning that takes fingerprint as inputs, outputs a similarity score. Extensive studies show that our framework can detect model IP breaches with confidence>99.99 within only 20 fingerprints of the suspect model.

We have examined this directly by a comparative RNA-Seq analysis of KBM-7 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and KBM-7 cells in which the NUDT2 Ap(4)A hydrolase gene had been disrupted (NuKO cells), causing a 175-fold increase in intracellular Ap(4)A. 6,288 differentially expressed genes were identified with P < 0.05. Of these, 980 were up-regulated and 705 down-regulated in NuKO cells with a fold-change  2. Ingenuity(?) Pathway Analysis (IPA(?)) was used to assign these genes to known canonical pathways and functional networks. Pathways associated with interferon responses, pattern recognition receptors and inflammation scored highly in the down-regulated set of genes while functions associated with MHC class II antigens were prominent among the up-regulated genes, which otherwise showed little organization into major functional gene sets. Tryptophan catabolism was also strongly down-regulated as were numerous genes known to be involved in tumor promotion in other systems, with roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conversely, some pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated. Major upstream factors predicted by IPA(?) for gene down-regulation included NFB, STAT1/2, IRF3/4 and SP1 but no major factors controlling gene up-regulation were identified. Potential mechanisms for gene regulation mediated by Ap(4)A and/or NUDT2 disruption include binding of Ap(4)A to the HINT1 co-repressor, autocrine activation of purinoceptors by Ap(4)A, chromatin remodeling, effects of NUDT2 loss on transcript stability, and inhibition of ATP-dependent regulatory factors such as protein kinases by Ap(4)A. Existing evidence favors the last of these as the most probable mechanism. Regardless, our results suggest that the NUDT2 protein could be a novel cancer chemotherapeutic target, with its inhibition potentially exerting strong anti-tumor effects via multiple pathways involving metastasis, invasion, immunosuppression and apoptosis.","output":"NUDT2 Disruption Elevates Diadenosine Tetraphosphate (Ap(4)A) and Down-Regulates Immune Response and Cancer Promotion Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across the globe, 2020 terms began under conditions incited by the corona pandemic.

This work highlighted how all of the country's health resources were unequally integrated into crisis response plans and the emergence of initiatives recognized but still to be consolidated. Integrating these validated initiatives into a coherent regional plan and an effective territorial declination, reinforcing the place of liberal resources in the response to health crises, defining the modalities of such integration and validating them through use appear today as many challenges to which we must collectively respond; the resilience of both the health system and its stakeholders is at stake, as well as the optimization of the latter's capacities to delay as much as possible situations of saturation or even overflow and thus free up the necessary room for maneuver, do not would it be for the implementation of reinforcements.","output":"Place de loffre de soins librale dans la rponse aux crises sanitaires"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this scoping review is to explore the existing literature related to nurses' use of mHealth apps in the management of chronic wounds and chart if and how these apps are being evaluated.

Flavonoids showed potential inhibitory activity against coronaviruses including the current pandemic outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and designated as COVID-19. Here, we have collected all data related to the potential inhibitory mechanisms of flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their significant immunomodulatory activities. The data were mapped and compared to elect major flavonoids with a promising role in the current pandemic. Further, we have linked the global existence of flavonoids in medicinal plants and their role in protection against COVID-19. Computational analysis predicted that flavonoids can exhibit potential inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 by binding to essential viral targets required in virus entry and/ or replication. Flavonoids also showed excellent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities including the inhibition of various inflammatory cytokines. Further, flavonoids showed significant ability to reduce the exacerbation of COVID-19 in the case of obesity via promoting lipids metabolism. Moreover, flavonoids exhibit a high safety profile, suitable bioavailability, and no significant adverse effects. For instance, plants rich in flavonoids are globally distributed and can offer great protection from COVID-19. The data described in this study strongly highlighted that flavonoids particularly quercetin and luteolin can exhibit promising multi-target activity against SARS-CoV-2, which promote their use in the current and expected future outbreaks. Therefore, a regimen of flavonoid-rich plants can be recommended to supplement a sufficient amount of flavonoids for the protection and treatment from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Flavonoids are promising safe therapy against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza could circulate in parallel with COVID-19.

We searched four databases from inception to 10 March, 2021. Random effects and fixed effects models were used to pool odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used funnel plots to evaluate the publication bias, I2 statistics to evaluate the heterogeneity, and conducted subgroup analyses.

Reducing nosocomial infections requires an integrated program of prevention and control using key clinical best care practices. No instrument currently exists that measures these practices in terms of personnel time and material costs. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an instrument that would measure nosocomial infection control and prevention best care practice costs, including estimates of human and material resources. METHODS: An evaluation of the literature identified four practices essential for the control of pathogens: hand hygiene, hygiene and sanitation, screening and additional precaution. To reflect time, materials and products used in these practices, our team developed a time and motion guide. Iterations of the guide were assessed in a Delphi technique; content validity was established using the content validity index and reliability was assessed using Kruskall Wallis one-way ANOVA of rank test. RESULTS: Two rounds of Delphi review were required; 88% of invited experts completed the assessment. The final version of the guide contains eight dimensions: Identification [83 items]; Personnel [5 items]; Additional Precautions [1 item]; Hand Hygiene [2 items]; Personal Protective Equipment [14 items]; Screening [4 items]; Cleaning and Disinfection of Patient Care Equipment [33 items]; and Hygiene and Sanitation [24 items]. The content validity index obtained for all dimensions was acceptable (> 80%). Experts statistically agreed on six of the eight dimensions. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This study developed and validated a new instrument based on expert opinion, the time and motion guide, for the systematic assessment of costs relating to the human and material resources used in nosocomial infection prevention and control. This guide will prove useful to measure the intensity of the application of prevention and control measures taken before, during and after outbreak periods or during pandemics such as COVID-19.","output":"Development and validation of a time and motion guide to assess the costs of prevention and control interventions for nosocomial infections: A Delphi method among experts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This Special Issue highlights various good practices and food policy discussion in relation to the transformation of current food systems toward their social, environmental and economical sustainability.

Surveillance, contact tracing, and case management are recognised as key components of outbreak prevention. Development of guidance for COVID-19 has drawn from existing management of other communicable diseases, including Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD). IMD is a rare but severe outcome of Neisseria meningitidis infection that can be prevented through vaccination. Cases still occur sporadically, requiring ongoing surveillance and consistent management. To this end, national and international public health agencies have developed and published guidance for identification and management of IMD cases. AIM: To assess national and international guidelines for the public health management of IMD, with a focus on the recommendations for identification and management of \\"close contacts\\" to IMD cases. METHODS: Guidelines from six national and international public health agencies were assessed using a modified version of the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument in four key domains: stakeholder involvement, developmental rigour, clarity, and applicability. A direct comparison of terminology and recommendations for identification and management of close contacts to IMD cases was also conducted. RESULTS: Guidelines from Europe and the United Kingdom rated most highly using the AGREE II Instrument, both presenting a clear, critical assessment of the strength of the available evidence, and the risks, costs, and benefits behind recommendations for management of close contacts. Direct comparison of guidelines identified inconsistencies in the language defining close contacts to IMD cases. CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between guidelines could be due to limited evidence concerning mechanisms behind disease transmission, along with the lack of a consistent process for development and review of guideline recommendations. COVID-19 management has demonstrated that international collaboration for development of public health guidance is possible, a practice that should be extended to management of other communicable diseases.","output":"Lessons for and from the COVID-19 pandemic response - An appraisal of guidance for the public health management of Invasive Meningococcal Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Despite the COVID-19 pandemic has been going on over 5 months, there is yet to be a standart management policy for all patients including to those mild-to-moderate cases.

Materials and Methods This was a prospective, observational, single center study on probable/confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital COVID-19 wards between March 20- April 30, 2020. Critically-ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of admission were excluded. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were collected. Results We included 174 consecutive probable/confirmed COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine wards of the University Adult Hospital between March 20 and April 30, 2020. The median age was 45.5 (19-92) years and 91 patients (52.3% ) were male. 120 (69%) were confirmed microbiologically, 41 (23.5%) radiologically diagnosed and, 13 (7.5%) were clinically suspected (negative microbiological and radiological findings compatible with COVID-19). According to WHO definitions, 35 (20.1%) had mild, 107 (61.5%) moderate disease, and 32 (18.4%) had severe pneumonia. Of 130/171 ( 74.3%) showed pneumonia; 80 were typical, 50 indeterminate infiltration for COVID-19. Patients admitted within a median of 3 days (0-14 days) after symptoms appear.

The mechanisms regulating the end of neural crest ontogeny are poorly understood. Whereas early crest development is stimulated by mesoderm-derived retinoic acid, we report that the end of the neural crest period is regulated by retinoic acid synthesized in the dorsal neural tube. Inhibition of retinoic acid signaling in the neural tube prevents the normal upregulation of BMP inhibitors in the nascent roof plate and prolongs the period of BMP responsiveness which otherwise ceases close to roof plate establishment. Consequently, neural crest production and emigration are extended well into the roof plate stage. In turn, extending the activity of neural crest-specific genes inhibits the onset of retinoic acid synthesis in roof plate suggesting a mutual repressive interaction between neural crest and roof plate traits. Although several roof plate-specific genes are normally expressed in the absence of retinoic acid signaling, roof plate and crest markers are co-expressed in single cells and this domain also contains dorsal interneurons. Hence, the cellular and molecular architecture of the roof plate is compromised. Collectively, our results demonstrate that neural tube-derived retinoic acid, via inhibition of BMP signaling, is an essential factor responsible for the end of neural crest generation and the proper segregation of dorsal neural lineages.","output":"Completion of neural crest cell production and emigration is regulated by retinoic-acid-dependent inhibition of BMP signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In the context of an ongoing debate on the potential risks of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia, it seems prudent to maintain the partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) in a physiological range during administration of supplemental oxygen. The PaO2 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) are closely related and both are used to monitor oxygenation status. However, SpO2 values cannot be used as an exact substitute for PaO2. The aim of this study in acutely ill and stable patients was to determine at which SpO2 level PaO2 is more or less certain to be in the physiological range. METHODS This is an observational study prospectively collecting data pairs of PaO2 and SpO2 values in patients admitted to the emergency room or intensive care unit (Prospective Inpatient Acutely ill cohort; PIA cohort). A second cohort of retrospective data of patients who underwent pulmonary function testing was also included (Retrospective Outpatient Pulmonary cohort; ROP cohort). Arterial hypoxemia was defined as PaO2 < 60 mmHg and hyperoxemia as PaO2 > 125 mmHg. The SpO2 cut-off values with the lowest risk of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia were determined as the 95th percentile of the observed SpO2 values corresponding with the observed hypoxemic and hyperoxemic PaO2 values. RESULTS 220 data pairs were collected in the PIA cohort. 95% of hypoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 below 94%, and 95% of hyperoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 above 96%. Additionally in the 1379 data pairs of the ROP cohort, 95% of hypoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 below 93%. CONCLUSION The SpO2 level marking an increased risk of arterial hypoxemia is not substantially different in acutely ill versus stable patients. In acutely ill patients receiving supplemental oxygen an SpO2 target of 95% maximizes the likelihood of maintaining PaO2 in the physiological range.","output":"Determining a target SpO2 to maintain PaO2 within a physiological range."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite 75 years of research into prevention and treatment of influenza, the viruses that cause this disease continue to rank as some of the most important pathogens afflicting humans today.

The RBD-tagged EVs can specifically recognize ACE2 receptor on the surface of target cells, which is required for the RBD-tagged EVs cellular uptake and targeting. Further, using the hACE2 transgenic mouse model, we show the RBD-tagged EVs accumulate specifically in the target tissues that highly express ACE2. Finally, we demonstrate that the RBD-tagged EVs that encapsulate siRNAs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus can specifically target lung tissues and suppress the pseudovirus infection in vivo. Together, our work presents a safe and effective engineered EV system for in vivo targeted delivery of potential antiviral agents into specific tissues which as a therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Tagged extracellular vesicles with the RBD of the viral spike protein for delivery of antiviral agents against SARS-COV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Wuhan was the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at population level in Wuhan to inform the development of vaccination strategies. METHODS: In this longitudinal cross-sectional study, we used a multistage, population-stratified, cluster random sampling method to systematically select 100 communities from the 13 districts of Wuhan. Households were systematically selected from each community and all family members were invited to community health-care centres to participate. Eligible individuals were those who had lived in Wuhan for at least 14 days since Dec 1, 2019. All eligible participants who consented to participate completed a standardised electronic questionnaire of demographic and clinical questions and self-reported any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or previous diagnosis of COVID-19. A venous blood sample was taken for immunological testing on April 14-15, 2020. Blood samples were tested for the presence of pan-immunoglobulins, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and neutralising antibodies were assessed. We did two successive follow-ups between June 11 and June 13, and between Oct 9 and Dec 5, 2020, at which blood samples were taken. FINDINGS: Of 4600 households randomly selected, 3599 families (782%) with 9702 individuals attended the baseline visit. 9542 individuals from 3556 families had sufficient samples for analyses. 532 (56%) of 9542 participants were positive for pan-immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2, with a baseline adjusted seroprevalence of 692% (95% CI 641-743) in the population. 437 (821%) of 532 participants who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins were asymptomatic. 69 (130%) of 532 individuals were positive for IgM antibodies, 84 (158%) were positive for IgA antibodies, 532 (100%) were positive for IgG antibodies, and 212 (398%) were positive for neutralising antibodies at baseline. The proportion of individuals who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins who had neutralising antibodies in April remained stable for the two follow-up visits (162 [446%] of 363 in June, 2020, and 187 [412%] of 454 in October-December, 2020). On the basis of data from 335 individuals who attended all three follow-up visits and who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins, neutralising antibody levels did not significantly decrease over the study period (median 1/56 [IQR 1/20 to 1/140] at baseline vs 1/56 [1/40 to 1/112] at first follow-up [p=10] and 1/63 [1/20 to 1/126] at second follow-up [p=029]). However, neutralising antibody titres were lower in asymptomatic individuals than in confirmed cases and symptomatic individuals. Although titres of IgG decreased over time, the proportion of individuals who had IgG antibodies did not decrease substantially (from 30 [100%] of 30 at baseline to 26 [897%] of 29 at second follow-up among confirmed cases, 65 [100%] of 65 at baseline to 58 [921%] of 63 at second follow-up among symptomatic individuals, and 437 [100%] of 437 at baseline to 329 [909%] of 362 at second follow-up among asymptomatic individuals). INTERPRETATION: 692% of a cross-sectional sample of the population of Wuhan developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 398% of this population seroconverting to have neutralising antibodies. Our durability data on humoral responses indicate that mass vaccination is needed to effect herd protection to prevent the resurgence of the epidemic.

However, in the context of COVID\\\\19 where the immediate response to stopping the spread of the virus requires collective efforts and change, other sociopolitical factors need to be considered. Prior research points to health behaviors being impacted by neighborhood and national social relations, social identification, confidence in government and political orientation. This research, though, is generally piecemeal (or specific), tends to be cross\\\\sectional, and is usually not oriented to pandemics. These issues are addressed in the current research. A two\\\\wave study with a representative sample of Australians (N (Wave 1) = 3028) gathered during COVID\\\\19 examined sociopolitical factors at the local and national level as predictors of health behaviors one month later. Four models were tested. These encapsulated geographic levels (local or national) and two health behaviors (hand hygiene or physical distance). In the three of the four models, social identification was a significant predictor of health behavior, while controlling for sociodemographic and individual\\\\level measures. There were more mixed results for social relations and confidence in government. There is evidence that to better promote health behaviors sociopolitical factors need to be more prominent in public policy and health behavior models. HIGHLIGHTS: The goal of this study is to examine how sociopolitical factors impact physical distance and hand hygiene during the Australian COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Based on social cohesion literature and the social identity approach, we expected three social cohesion dimensions (social identification, confidence in government and social relations) to predict greater health behaviors one month later. Political orientation was also expected to predict health behaviors. The results show that social identification consistently predicts health behaviors, with weaker evidence for political orientation and confidence in the government, and mixed evidence for social relations. This research highlights the importance of considering and strengthening the sociopolitical context in our response to pandemics.","output":"United We Stand, Divided We Fall: Sociopolitical Predictors of Physical Distancing and Hand Hygiene During the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues around the world, where the United States is among the worst in terms of both morbidity and fatality of the viral infection. We aim to investigate the plausible link of tissue SARS-CoV-2 viral entry gene expression, such as TMPRSS2 and ACE2, with infection and death by gender during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We find a significantly higher incidence of COVID-19 death in men than in women, even though SARS-CoV-2 infection in women is higher than in men. We discover that the expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in intestine, but not in lung, tends to be positively associated with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in men. In contrast, the high incidence of death in men is negatively correlated with TMPRSS2/ACE2 expression in intestine. Strikingly, the correlation of TMPRSS2/ACE2 expression with SARS-CoV-2 infection and death is the opposite in females, compared with that in males. Interestingly, male hormone signaling seems to be involved in mortality, as the low expression of testosterone receptor AR in the prostate contributes to death in men according to age. These observations point to a plausible contribution of male hormone metabolism in the regulation of TMPRSS2/ACE2 signaling to fatality by SARS-CoV-2 infection in men.","output":"A Plausible Link of TMPRSS2/ACE2/AR Signaling to Male Mortality during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent evidence suggests that exercise/physical activity (PA) can beneficially alter the gut microbiome composition of young people, but little is known about its effects in older adults.

The goal of the American Academy of Pediatrics National Coordinating Center for Epilepsy's project, Access Improvement and Management of Epilepsy with Telehealth (AIM-ET), was to identify access and management challenges in the deployment of telehealth technology. AIM-ET organised four paediatric neurology teams to partner with primary-care providers (PCP) and their multidisciplinary teams. Telehealth visits were conducted for paediatric epilepsy patients. A post-visit survey assessed access and satisfaction with the telehealth visit compared to an in-person visit. Pre/post surveys completed by PCPs and neurologists captured telehealth visit feasibility, functionality and provider satisfaction. A provider focus group assessed facilitators and barriers to telehealth. Sixty-one unique patients completed 75 telehealth visits. Paired t-test analysis demonstrated that telehealth enhanced access to epilepsy care. It reduced self-reported out-of-pocket costs (p<0.001), missed school hours (p<0.001) and missed work hours (p<0.001), with 94% equal parent/caregiver satisfaction.

In this study, we investigated the role of spleen macrophages in immunity against mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). Previous studies showed that spleen and liver macrophages are the first target cells for infection by MHV-A59 in vivo, suggesting that they could be involved in the induction of immune responses against MHV-A59. We used a macrophage depletion technique to deplete macrophages in vivo and studied the induction of virus-specific antibody and cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses and non-immune resistance against MHV-A59 in normal and macrophage-depleted mice. Virus titres in spleen and liver increased rapidly in macrophage-depleted mice, resulting in death of mice within 4 days after infection. Elimination of macrophages before immunization with MHV-A59 resulted in increased virus-specific humoral and T-cell proliferative responses. However, virus-specific CTL responses were not altered in macrophage-depleted mice. Our results show that spleen macrophages are of major importance as scavenger cells during MHV-A59 infection and are involved in clearance of virus from the host. In addition, macrophages may be involved in the regulation of acquired immune responses. In the absence of macrophages, increased virus-specific T-cell and antibody responses are detectable, suggesting that macrophages suppress MHV-A59-specific T- and B-cell responses and that other cells serve as antigen-presenting cells.","output":"Role of spleen macrophages in innate and acquired immune responses against mouse hepatitis virus strain A59."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We performed a large outcome study at group and individual level in which the goals of genetic counselling were operationalized into cognitive and affective outcomes: empowerment, perceived personal control and anxiety.

We evaluated whether any major classes of antihypertensive drugs were significantly associated with switching as a proxy measure of medication side effects in a large Chinese population in Hong Kong. METHODS: From a clinical database, all adult patients newly prescribed an antihypertensive mono-therapy in Hong Kong between the years 2001C2003 and 2005 were included. Those who paid only one visit, died or stayed in the cohort for <180 days after the prescription, or prescribed more than one antihypertensive agent were excluded. The factors associated with switching at 180 days were evaluated by multivariate regression analyses. Age, gender, payment status, service type, district of residence, drug class, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were predictor variables. RESULTS: From 250,851 subjects, 159,813 patients were eligible. A total of 6,163 (3.9%) switched their medications within 180 days. Patients prescribed thiazide diuretics had the highest switching rate (5.6%), followed by ACEIs (4.5%), CCBs (4.4%) and beta-blockers (3.2%). When compared with ACEIs, patients on thiazide diuretics were significantly more likely to be switchers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.49, 95% C.I. 1.31C1.69, p<0.001), whilst patients prescribed CCBs and beta-blockers were similarly likely to have switching. Following these patients up for 5 years showed that thiazide had the most marked increase in switching rate.

Athletes from specific sport disciplines have experienced the new situation in different ways. Therefore, understanding their individual experiences and psychological responses may help to design better intervention programs. Accordingly, this study investigated the relationship between athletes' personality traits and anxiety in the light of their individual experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE The COVID-19 impact questionnaire, Big Five Inventory-35, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were administered to 321 male and 168 female athletes in Turkey from various sport disciplines. At the time of data collection, training and competitions had been canceled in all sports for two months. RESULTS Most athletes (70.7%) were worried about being infected with SARS-CoV-2 if competitions were to restart soon. The regression analyses revealed that emotional stability, extroversion, and age were negative predictors of state anxiety;emotional stability, extroversion, and conscientiousness were negative predictors of trait anxiety;agreeableness was a positive predictor of state anxiety. Athletes who perceived that their relationships with family or close friends worsened during home confinement (17.2%) had significantly higher state anxiety and trait anxiety scores than those who perceived a positive relationship change (28%) or no relationship change (54.8%). The agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability scores of athletes who perceived a negative relationship change with family or close friends were also significantly lower than for athletes who perceived no change or a positive change.

Forty-seven students and five facilitators completed an online survey designed to evaluate the quality of individual and collaborative learning in the PBL online context. All participants had experience of pre-COVID-19 face-to-face PBL. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyse qualitative and quantitative data, respectively.

Aspects of functionality offered by the virtual platform assisted in the PBL process, however technical and environmental barriers impeded virtual delivery. Responses suggest that the development of rapport and interactivity levels online are not equivalent to face-to-face PBL, and these factors were perceived by participants to negatively influence the learning process. Perspectives on the role of the facilitator online convey divergent views between second and third years which reflected a change in facilitator style to support more independent learning in line with students' progression through the course.

The development of the microscope by Hook and Van Leeuwenhoek in the seventeenth century led to the discovery of a new living world inhabited by very small creatures. Edward Jenner in England demonstrated that smallpox, a dreaded disease, could be prevented by inoculation with an organism that caused pockmarks on cows and dairymaids; this was the beginning of the concept of vaccination. Louis Pasteur proved that fermentation only occurred in the presence of air and was due to microorganisms. Pasteur and Pierre Roux, a colleague, as well as Jacob Henle and Robert Koch, proved that germs caused bacterial diseases such as anthrax and tuberculosis; Pasteur and Roux developed a vaccine against rabies by passaging the infectious material through rabbits. By the end of the nineteenth century it had been established that most infectious diseases were the result of germs. In parallel with this research, plant scientists had isolated material that passed through a low pore filter that was infectious to tobacco plants. This was called a virus, from the Latin for poison.

To date, a myriad of Ab tests, both available and FDA authorized for emergency, has led to confusion rather than insight per se. The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in 8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity.

A novel human coronavirus, named COVID-19, has recently emerged in Hubei Province, China. Within the first two months, more than 2200 deaths have been confirmed, and there have been more than 79,000 hospitalized patients, mainly in China. Understanding the virus mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. In this study, the COVID-19 corona viral spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The cyclic peptide Pep42 (CTVALPGGYVRVC) was reported earlier to be the docking platform of GRP78 in cancer cells. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature (the S-S bond), have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain  (SBD). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBD of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol.

In July 2020, workers (company employees and civil servants) in Japan were recruited from local institutions that had not had any confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as neighborhoods that had only a few cases. Participants completed a COVID-19 mental health survey (N = 609; 66.9% male). Psychological distress was identified based on Kessler-6 scores (13). Life changes were assessed by an open-ended question about life changes in participants and their family, workplace, and community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A convergent mixed-method approach was used to compare the context of perceived life changes in participants with psychological distress and those without. As a result, 8.9% of participants had psychological distress, and sex and age categories were different between those with psychological distress and those without. Among the participants who responded to the open-ended question, the biggest life change was staying at home, and the next biggest life changes were event cancellations and increased workload in participants with psychological distress, and no changes and mask-wearing in those without psychological distress, respectively. Regarding emotional/perceptual changes, stress, fear, and anger were more frequently reported by participants with psychological distress than those without (P <0.001).

We describe the development of a clinical protocol for a multilevel, community-based, mHealth PA intervention for AA women. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An mHealth intervention targeting AA women living in resource-limited Washington, DC communities was developed based on the socioecological framework for PA. Over 6 months, we will use a Sequential Multi-Assignment, Randomized Trial approach to compare the effects on PA of location-based remote messaging (named tailored-to-place) to standard remote messaging in an mHealth intervention. Participants will be randomised to a remote messaging intervention for 3 months, at which point the intervention strategy will adapt based on individuals PA levels. Those who do not meet the PA goal will be rerandomised to more intensive treatment. Participants will be followed for another 3 months to determine the contribution of each mHealth intervention to PA level. This protocol will use novel statistical approaches to account for the adaptive strategy. Finally, effects of PA changes on CVD risk biomarkers will be characterised.

We will extract data on risk of bias judgments in the seven Cochrane bias domains and trial sample sizes and evaluate time trends using run charts. The primary outcome will be time trends in the annual proportion of trials with overall low risk of bias (low risk of bias in all bias domains). The secondary outcomes include time trends in the annual median trial sample size, and the annual proportion of trials with low-, unclear- and high risk of bias in each of the seven Cochrane bias domains. DISCUSSION The outlined meta-epidemiologic study will assess time trends in risk of bias and sample sizes in RCTs assessing ICU interventions. This will inform researchers, healthcare personnel and policymakers on the general reliability of findings from RCTs of ICU interventions over time, and inform future RCT design and reporting.","output":"Bias and sample size in intensive care unit trials: Protocol for a meta-epidemiological study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years. These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease are discussed. Expert opinion: Treatment of SARS and MERS in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutics with general antiviral activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular, rodent, or nonhuman primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection. Based on lessons learned from SARS and MERS outbreaks, lack of drugs capable of pan-coronavirus antiviral activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogenic coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Broad-spectrum coronavirus antiviral drug discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the clinical entity caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are not limited to the respiratory system. Leukoencephalopathy with microbleeds is increasingly seen in patients with COVID-19. New information is needed to delineate better the clinical implications of this infectious disease. CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old man with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe COVID-19. After transfer to the general wards, the patient was noted drowsy, disorientated, with slow thinking and speech. A brain MRI showed bilateral symmetrical hyperintense lesions in the deep and subcortical whiter matter, involving the splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as multiple microhemorrhages implicating the splenium and subcortical white matter. No contrast-enhanced lesions were observed in brain CT or MRI. CSF analysis showed no abnormalities, including a negative rtRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. An outpatient follow-up visit showed near-complete clinical recovery and resolution of the hyperintense lesions on MRI, without microbleeds change. CONCLUSION: We present the case of a survivor of severe COVID-19 who presented diffuse posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy, and microbleeds masquerading as acute necrotizing encephalopathy. We postulate that this kind of cerebral vasogenic edema with microbleeds could be the consequence of hypoxia, inflammation, the prothrombotic state and medical interventions such as mechanical ventilation and anticoagulation.","output":"COVID-19-related diffuse posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy and microbleeds masquerades as acute necrotizing encephalopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants are emerging as a major threat to vaccination efforts worldwide as they may increase virus transmission rate and/or confer the ability to escape vaccine induced immunity with knock on effects on the level of herd immunity and vaccine efficacy respectively. These variants concern the Spike protein, which is encoded by the S gene, involved in virus entry into host cells and the major target of vaccine development. We report here that genetic variants of the N gene can impair our ability to utilize antigenic tests for both diagnosis and mass testing efforts aimed at controlling virus transmission. While conducting a large validation study on the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag test, we noticed that some swab samples failed to generate a positive result in spite of a high viral load in Rt-PCR assays. Sequencing analysis of viruses showing discordant results in the Rt-PCR and antigen assays revealed the presence of multiple disruptive amino-acid substitutions in the N antigen (the viral protein detected in the antigen test) clustered from position 229 to 374 a region known to contain an immunodominant epitope. A relevant fraction of the variants, undetected by the antigen test, contained the mutations A376T coupled to M241I. Intriguingly we found that virus sequences with this mutation were over-represented in the antigen-test-negative and PCR-positive samples and progressively increased in frequency over time in Veneto, a region of Italy that has aggressively scaled up the utilization of antigen tests, which reached nearly 68% of all the SARS-CoV-2 swab assays performed there. We speculate that mass utilization of antigen assays could create a selection pressure on the target that may favor the spread of undetectable virus variants.","output":"Emergence of N antigen SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants escaping detection of antigenic tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: People with Kidney Transplantation require immunosuppressant treatments and this classifies them as a population at risk for virus and/or bacterial infections The objective of the study was to describe the follow-up of transplanted people with suspected COVID19 infection METHODS: Descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study with prospective follow-up carried out between March and June 2020 Sociodemographic and clinical data were recorded for the assessment, control and follow-up of the cases The results were expressed with means and standard deviation, median and interquartile range, or frequencies and percentages The chi-square test was used to compare qualitative variables and the Student's T test to compare quantitative variables with normal distribution If they did not follow a normal distribution, the Mann Whitney U test was used The level of statistical significance was established at p&lt;0 05 RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were included, with a mean of 62 7313 01 years and a median of 39 5 [7 5;93] months transplanted 2 482 69 calls/patient were made during a period of 3 464 41 days Virtual follow-up was performed with 100% (n=56) and 71 43% (n=40) required hospital admission at some point 28 57% (n=16) of the people evaluated were managed at home The PCR test was performed on 85 71% (n=48) of the study population, being positive in 48 21% (n=27) 29 62% (n=8) of the positive cases required invasive mechanical ventilation and 33 33% (n=9) died The mortality rate in the study population is 4 17 times higher than that presented in the data from the registries in the general population CONCLUSIONS: According to the mortality data, it is essential to maintain close contact with the main objective of referring the case to the hospital system at the slightest suspicion of complication Remote monitoring is offered as a positive opportunity for the control of transplant recipients who require close monitoring by the nursing team","output":"[Monitoring and telematic control of people with kidney transplant and suspected COVID-19 infection.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic changed our lives quickly and abruptly.

The contribution of forest carbon sink is well-known, but the carbon sink function of mariculture is rarely known. Based on the statistics of China's fishery department and the quality assessment method, this paper constructed a preliminary accounting system for the removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae, and estimated its capacity in China from 2005 to 2017. On this basis, the logarithmic mean Divisia index was used to analyze the effects of structure and scale factors on the removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae. The results showed that the annual average removable carbon sink of shellfish and algae in China's mariculture reached 92.7 ten thousand tons, and the overall trend was upward. The total removable carbon sink of shellfish was greater than that of algae. Among them, Grassastrea gigas was the main source of removable carbon sink in China's mariculture, followed by Ruditapes philippinarum. The economic value of annual removable carbon sink of mariculture shellfish and algae in China was equivalent to 139-556 million dollars.

Moreover, estrous cycle-related fluctuations in estrogen levels have been linked with alternating pain sensitivity. Aberrant central circuitry involving both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the lumbosacral spinal cord has also been implicated in the modulation of visceral pain in clinical and preclinical studies. Here we further investigate changes in visceral pain sensitivity and central glutamatergic systems in rats with respect to estrous cycle and ELS. METHODS We investigated visceral sensitivity in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, which had undergone maternal separation (MS) in early life or remained non-separated (NS), by performing colorectal distension (CRD). We also assessed excitatory amino acid uptake through excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in the lumbosacral spinal cord and ACC. RESULTS NS animals in proestrus and estrus exhibited reduced EAAT uptake and decreased threshold to CRD. Moreover, total pain behaviors were increased in these stages. MS rats exhibited lower pain thresholds and higher total pain behaviors to CRD across all stages of the estrous cycle. Interestingly, cortical EAAT function in MS rats was inhibited in the low estrogen state-an effect completely opposite to that seen in NS rats. CONCLUSIONS This data confirms that estrous cycle and ELS are significant factors in visceral sensitivity and fluctuations in EAAT function may be a perpetuating factor mediating central sensitization.","output":"Estrous cycle influences excitatory amino acid transport and visceral pain sensitivity in the rat: effects of early-life stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is seen world-wide.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently spreading around the world. The relationships among the pandemic and its associated travel restrictions, social distancing measures, contact tracing, mask-wearing habits and medical consultation efficiency have not yet been extensively assessed. Based on the epidemic data reported by the Health Commission of Wenzhou, we analysed the developmental characteristics of the epidemic and modified the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model in three discrete ways. (1) According to the implemented preventive measures, the epidemic was divided into three stages: initial, outbreak and controlled. (2) We added many factors, such as health protections, travel restrictions and social distancing, close-contact tracing and the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (TSOH), to the model. (3) Exposed and infected people were subdivided into isolated and free-moving populations. For the parameter estimation of the model, the average TSOH and daily cured cases, deaths and imported cases can be obtained through individual data from epidemiological investigations. The changes in daily contacts are simulated using the intracity travel intensity (ICTI) from the Baidu Migration Big Data platform. The optimal values of the remaining parameters are calculated by the grid search method. With this model, we calculated the sensitivity of the control measures with regard to the prevention of the spread of the epidemic by simulating the number of infected people in various hypothetical situations. Simultaneously, through a simulation of a second epidemic, the challenges from the rebound of the epidemic were analysed, and prevention and control recommendations were made. The results show that the modified SEIR model can effectively simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Wenzhou.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate whether this prolongation increases with the cumulative dose of chloroquine and is associated with the peak plasma concentration of chloroquine. Furthermore, the number of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment or had an adjustment in dose due to QTc-interval prolongation was established. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was performed in patients aged over 18 years, hospitalised for a suspected or proven infection with COVID-19, and therefore treated with chloroquine, with a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed prior to the start of treatment and at least one ECG after starting the treatment. RESULTS: In total, 397 patients were included. The mean increase in QTc interval throughout the treatment with chloroquine was 33a?ms. Nineteen out of 344 patients unnecessarily had their treatment prematurely discontinued or adjusted due to a prolonged QTc interval based on the computerised interpretation of the ECG. CONCLUSION: Chloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients gradually increased the QTc interval.

The secondary goals were (1) to describe the collaboration, (2) to assess knowledge gained from the intervention, (3) to assess patient understanding of their therapy intent, and (4) to explore patient's experiences via qualitative analysis. METHODS: We piloted the original English booklet at a single site and requested feedback from patients and providers. The booklet was updated; translated into Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and Pidgin English; and used at three additional sites. For the three-site cohort, we collected basic demographics, pretest and post-test assessing content in the booklet, and performed a qualitative analysis. RESULTS: The original booklet was widely acceptable and recommended by patients at site one (n = 31) and by providers (N = 26) representing all four sites.

This demonstrates the application of data science methods and epidemiological techniques in public health decision-making while addressing the gap of timely and reliable decision aiding tools.","output":"An Interactive Dashboard for Real-Time Analytics and Monitoring of COVID-19 Outbreak in India: A proof of Concept"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical exercise has wide-ranging benefits to cognitive functioning and mental state, effects very closely resembling enhancements to hippocampal functioning. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in many of these mental benefits of exercise. However, precise mechanisms behind these effects are not well known. Released peripherally during exercise, beta-endorphins are an intriguing candidate for moderating increases in neurogenesis and the related behavioral benefits of exercise. Although historically ignored due to their peripheral release and status as a peptide hormone, this review highlights reasons for further exploring beta-endorphin as a key mediator of hippocampal neurogenesis. This includes possible routes for beta-endorphin signaling into the hippocampus during exercise, direct effects of beta-endorphin on cell proliferation and neurogenesis, and behavioral effects of manipulating endogenous opioid signaling. Together, beta-endorphin appears to be a promising mechanism for understanding the specific ways that exercise promotes adult neurogenesis specifically and brain health broadly.","output":"A Runners High for New Neurons?

We propose that AECs, which regulate animal research in part on the basis of reducing harm, can and ought to require that these harms to researchers are reduced as well. The paper starts by presenting evidence of these burdens and their harm, giving some examples showing how they may be mitigated. We then argue that AECs are well placed to account for these harms to personnel and ought to use their power to reduce their occurrence. We conclude by responding to four potential objections: (1) that this problem should be addressed through health and safety administration, not research ethics administration; (2) that the proposal is unjustifiably paternalistic; (3) that these harms to laboratory animal personnel ought to occur, given their treatment of animals; and (4) that mitigating them may lead to worse treatment of research animals.","output":"Animal researchers shoulder a psychological burden that animal ethics committees ought to address"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case of a nasal myiasis in a 3-yr-old Italian girl who was referred to Bambino Ges Hospital in Rome, Italy, is reported.

METHODS: From May to October 2020, 35 participants were enrolled for the usability study and followed up for 4 months. Blood samples for the drug concentration in the dried blood spots were obtained once during the second to fourth follow-up visits. The effectiveness of adherence monitoring was analyzed using Cohen's kappa statistic to calculate the concordance between the average number of pills taken and drug concentration in the dried blood spots. RESULTS: Overall retention was 91.4% (32 participants) at the end of the study. Participants used the app for a mean of 29 days and made 2565 data entries in total, with an average of 76 data entries. The average systematic usability scale score for the app was 71.5, indicating acceptable usability. Slight agreement was reached between the dried blood spots measurement and the number of pills taken and recorded in the app (weighted kappa: 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Our user-centered UPrEPU app demonstrated that it could accommodate both daily and event-driven dosing schedules for men who have sex with men clients with acceptable usability scores.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 86 participants. The translation and adaptation followed international guidelines with two direct translations, a synthesized version of the direct translations, two reverse translations, consensus by an expert committee of a pre-final version, pre-test by end users and final version. The discriminative power (logistic regression analyses), construct validity (Pearson and Spearmans correlation), internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha coefficient), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) and ceiling and floor effects were analyzed. RESULTS: The Spanish version showed good construct validity (high correlation with comparable domains of the SF-36), high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient: 0.84) and excellent test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.967, 95%, CI 0.917 - 0.989).

The clinical presentation of this virus mainly manifests in the respiratory system but may also lead to severe complications in the cardiovascular system. The global burden of COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented need to gain further insight into patient outcomes, management, and clinical practice. This review aims to provide an overview of the current literature on heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, management, and care pathways for supporting patients during and beyond this pandemic. A literature review of five areas of interest was conducted and included: (i) HF hospitalization; (ii) recognizing the needs and supporting HF patients during COVID-19; (iii) supporting rehabilitation services; (iv) transitioning to a telehealth framework; and (v) the need for evidence. Patients with new-onset or existing HF are particularly vulnerable, but a significant reduction in HF hospital admissions has been reported. During these periods of uncertainty, the current care pathways for acute and elective cardiac patients have had to change with the relocation of HF services to protect the vulnerable and reduce transmission of COVID-19. Optimizing community HF services has the potential to reduce the pressures on secondary care during the recovery from this pandemic. Telemedicine and virtual health care are emerging technologies and overcome the risk of in-person exposure. Successful remote delivery of cardiac rehabilitation services has been reported during the pandemic. Delivery of a robust telehealth framework for HF patients will improve communication between clinician and patient. The reduction in HF admissions is a concern for the future and may result in unintended mortality. New-onset and current HF patients must understand their diagnosis and future prognosis and seek help and support using the appropriate platform when needed. Realigning HF services and the use of telemedicine and virtual health care has great potential but needs to be carefully understood to ensure engagement and approval in this population to overcome barriers and challenges.","output":"Insights into heart failure hospitalizations, management, and services during and beyond COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to respond effectively and efficiently during times of crisis, including a pandemic, has emerged as a competency for nurse leaders.

The group of COVID-19-positive acute/subacute thromboembolism cases was compared with both the group of normal brain imaging cases and the non-COVID-19 acute/subacute thromboembolism group in terms of demographic data and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: When the acute/subacute thromboembolism group and neuroimaging findings were compared in terms of negative group, presence of comorbid disease, D-dimer level, and lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients, a statistically significant difference was found (p = 0.047, 0.014, and <0.001, respectively).

The sample consisted of voluntarily participating German elementary (n = 857) and secondary school teachers (n = 1,590) from a sample of randomly drawn schools in four federal states in Germany. We describe the main survey findings and examine the importance of different distance teaching aspects for teacher reports of students attaining their learning objectives and students learning progress during distance teaching. Our results particularly highlight the necessity for students and teachers to remain in contact in all the surveyed school types. In elementary school, regular contact between teachers and parents is similarly important. The key challenges highlighted inadequate digitalization, the participation of all students, and students motivation. Correspondingly, adequate technical equipment for schools, teachers, and students, together with teachers and students competence to use technical devices and digital media as well as students motivation to participate in distance learning were found to be necessary prerequisites for successful distance teaching.

Parents and caregivers often facilitate their childrens care and provide pragmatic and emotional support to their children; this high level of care is challenging to maintain, as with any chronic, relapsing condition. In the case of SUDs, the challenges caregivers face may be exacerbated by the stigma and the blame associated with parents in the development and maintenance of childrens SUDs, and the strains that come with navigating barriers related to accessing treatment in the USA. Estimates suggest that healthcare spending for substance use treatment is relatively low and few utilize therapeutic family treatment. This disconnect between widespread SUD prevalence, and service underutilization, indicates that families who need treatment are not accessing it. The present paper synthesizes the extant literature on the role of family members in SUD treatment, as families are a primary context of care for their childrens treatment across many chronic, relapsing conditions.

PDCoV has spread to many countries around the world, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method for detection of PDCoV in clinical samples is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a single-tube one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay specific for nucleocapsid gene to diagnose and monitor PDCoV infections. The detection limit of RT-LAMP assay was 1  10(1) copies of PDCoV, which was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than gel-based one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This assay could specifically amplify PDCoV and had no cross amplification with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). By screening a panel of clinical specimens (N = 192), this method presented a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and was 1C2 log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR in detection of PDCoV. CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP assay established in this study is a potentially valuable tool, especially in low-resource laboratories and filed settings, for a rapid diagnosis, surveillance, and molecular epidemiology investigation of PDCoV infections.

We examined the association between psychiatric disorders and hydroxychloroquine adherence and determined whether psychiatric treatment modifies this association. METHODS We identified incident hydroxychloroquine users among youth with SLE (ages 10-24 years) using de-identified U.S. commercial insurance claims in Optum Clinformatics? Data Mart (2000-2016). Adherence was estimated using medication possession ratios (MPR) over a 365-day interval. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of having any psychiatric disorder on MPR, as well as the independent effects of depression, anxiety, adjustment and other psychiatric disorders. We tested for interactions between psychiatric diagnoses and treatment with psychotropic medications or psychotherapy. RESULTS Among 873 subjects, 20% had a psychiatric diagnosis, most commonly depression. Only adjustment disorders were independently associated with decreased MPRs ( -0.12, p=0.05). We observed significant crossover interactions, in which psychiatric disorders had opposite effects on adherence depending on the receipt of psychiatric treatment. Among youth with any psychiatric diagnosis, psychotropic medication use was associated with a 0.15 increase in MPR compared with no psychotropic medication (p=0.02 for interaction). Among youth with depression or anxiety, psychotherapy was also associated with a higher MPR compared with no psychotherapy (p=0.05 and p<0.01 for interaction, respectively). CONCLUSION The impact of psychiatric disorders on medication adherence differed by whether youth had received psychiatric treatment. Improving recognition and treatment of psychiatric conditions may increase adherence in youth with SLE.","output":"The Impact of Psychiatric Diagnosis and Treatment on Medication Adherence in Youth with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Increasingly, digital technologies, especially mobile telecommunications and smartphone apps, are seen as a novel tool for managing severe mental disorders (SMDs) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there is a need to identify best practices in the use of digital technologies to effectively reach, support, and manage care for patients living with SMDs. In this review, we summarize recent studies using digital technology to manage symptoms and support clinical care for this patient population and discuss new opportunities to advance digital psychiatry research and practice in LMICs. RECENT FINDINGS Studies evaluating digital interventions for clinical populations living with SMDs in LMICs are limited. Yet, across recent articles surveyed, digital technology appears to yield diverse benefits for this at-risk patient population. These benefits include improved medication adherence, appointment adherence, reduced instances of relapse, and fewer re-hospitalizations. SUMMARY Continued rigorous research evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital technologies in reaching, treating, and managing symptoms and supporting clinical care for patients with SMDs in LMICs is vital. The urgency for remote approaches for delivering specialized psychiatric care is particularly pronounced because of the immediate and long-term impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on access to in-person services. Future research should emphasize participatory approaches rooted in a process of codesign with target users, in order to achieve clinically effective remotely delivered digital mental health interventions.","output":"Digital technology for management of severe mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structure of the human MHC\\\\I molecule HLA\\\\A*1101 in complex with a nonameric peptide (KTFPPTEPK) has been determined by X\\\\ray crystallography to 1.45 ? resolution.

No published guidelines on SBOHP implementation existed. Our work describes how philanthropic, public, and academic organizations partnered to support dental safety net providers with designing comprehensive SBOHPs in North and South Carolina. DESCRIPTION: A multi-sector leadership team was established to manage a new SBOHP philanthropic-funded grant program organized into two phases, Readiness and Implementation, with the former a 6-month planning period in preparation of the latter. Readiness included technical assistance (TA) delivered through coaching and 15 online learning modules organized in four domains: operations, finance, enabling services, and impact. Organizations could apply for implementation grants after successful TA completion. Process evaluation was used including a Readiness Stoplight Report for tracking progression. ASSESSMENT: Ten Readiness grantees completed the TA. A variety of models resulted, including mobile, portable and fixed clinics. Descriptive analysis was conducted on the readiness stoplight reports. Components of the operation and finance domains required were the most time-intensive, specifically the development of policy manuals, production goals, and financial performance tracking. CONCLUSION: The programs structure resulted in (a) a two-state learning community, (b) SBOHP practice and policy alignment, and (c) coordinated program distribution. TA improvements are planned to account for COVID-19 threats, including school closures, space limitations, and transmission fears. Telehealth, non-aerosolizing procedures, and improved scheduling and communication can address concerns. Organizations considering SBOHPs should explore similar recommendations to navigate adverse circumstances.","output":"A Technical Assistance Curriculum for Expanding Sustainable School-Based Oral Health Programs in the Carolinas Dental Safety Net"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accumulating evidence suggests that many immune responses are influenced by local nutrient concentrations in addition to the programming of intermediary metabolism within immune cells. Humoral immunity and germinal centers (GC) are settings in which these factors are under active investigation. Hypoxia is an example of how a particular nutrient is distributed in lymphoid follicles during an antibody response, and how oxygen sensors may impact the qualities of antibody output after immunization. Using exclusively a bio-informatic analysis of mRNA levels in GC and other B cells, recent work challenged the concept that there is any hypoxia or that it has any influence. To explore this proposition, we performed new analyses of published genomics data, explored potential sources of disparity, and elucidated aspects of the apparently conflicting conclusions. Specifically, replicability and variance among data sets derived from different na?ve as well as GC B cells were considered. The results highlight broader issues that merit consideration, especially at a time of heightened focus on scientific reports in the realm of immunity and antibody responses. Based on these analyses, a standard is proposed under which the relationship of new data sets should be compared to prior \\"fingerprints\\" of cell types and reported transparently to referees and readers. In light of independent evidence of diversity within and among GC elicited by protein immunization, avoidance of overly broad conclusions about germinal centers in general when experimental systems are subject to substantial constraints imposed by technical features also is warranted.","output":"Over-Generalizing About GC (Hypoxia): Pitfalls of Limiting Breadth of Experimental Systems and Analyses in Framing Informatics Conclusions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVED-19 has been one of the most severe diseases, causing a harsh pandemic all over the world, since December 2019.

Although previous studies had investigated the adverse drug reaction (ADR) of the medications for COVID-19 in their respective local settings, the safety profile in a Malaysian setting remains unknown. Our study aims to establish the incidence of ADR for drugs used in COVID-19 management in a Malaysian tertiary hospital. METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled patients started on drugs for COVID-19 in Sungai Buloh Hospital from 1 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. The clinical staging of COVID-19 patients was decided by the treating physician in accordance with the Clinical Management of Confirmed COVID-19 Case in Adults (Annex 2E). Suspected ADRs were evaluated with a trigger tool of pre-defined laboratory values or the adverse events listed in the registered product insert. Causality assessment was conducted when an ADR was suspected using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system, and only cases classified as certain, probable and possible ADR were considered. Data analysis was completed with descriptive, univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The study (N = 1,080) identified 217 patients (20.1%) who experienced ADR, with 246 adverse events detected. Most events were related to the gastrointestinal (43.5%), hepatobiliary (36.2%) and cardiac (16.3%) systems. The most commonly suspected drugs were atazanavir (52.7%), chloroquine (36.8%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (34.6%). The independent risk factors of ADR were female (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.53; 95% CI 1.06C2.20; P = 0.024), diagnosis of COVID-19 stage 3 (adjusted OR: 2.58; 95% CI 1.20C5.55; P = 0.015) and stage 4 (adjusted OR: 4.17; 95% CI 1.79C9.73; P = 0.001), and the number of COVID-19 drugs (adjusted OR: 3.34; 95% CI 2.51C4.44; P < 0.001).

The tool was validated in three different clinical scenarios and the associated processes were refined through MDT inquiries. There as 5 steps to completing the tool as a collaborative MDT. 1. Framing the question Questions can be categorised into two categories. Category 1: Direct comparison between the same service/pathway in two different departments. Category 2: Comparison of two alternative pathways in a single department. 2. Identifying drivers Primary and secondary drivers for answering the given question should be discussed and noted to allow for considered evaluation of scoring following completion of the tool 3. Scoping Review of the metrics/measures of quality and efficiency/resource for different aspects of the pathway should be identified under the headings outlined below. - Structure: Consider the attributes of the service/ pathway such as e.g. Staff to patient ratios, Skill Mix/Pay banding - Process: Consider how each procedure/system of work interacts in order to achieve the outcomes as defined by clinical policies and procedures. - Outcome: Measures should consider the impact on potential endpoints. 4. Scoring Each aspects of the pathway identified under the different headings is discussed and scored according to the scoring matrix for both the quality and efficiency/productivity (table 1). Only a quality score is applied to the outcomes.

The selection of the countries was based on the daily basis mean temperature from the date of appearance of the initial cases of COVID-19, Dec 29, 2019 to May 12, 2020. In the world's 10 hottest countries, the mean temperature was (26.311.51) and humidity (44.674.97). However, in the world's 10 coldest countries the mean temperature was (6.191.61) and humidity (57.262.35). The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization, and daily information on temperature and humidity was obtained from metrological web \\"Time and Date\\". RESULTS In countries with high temperatures and low humidity, the mean daily cases incidence were (407.1224.33); cumulative cases (9094.34708.29); and cumulative deaths (452.8443.30) were significantly low compared to countries with low temperatures and high humidity: daily cases (1876.72207.37); cumulative cases (44232.385875.11); and cumulative deaths (2008.29310.13). Moreover, COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population were significantly low in countries with high temperatures (cases 711.23, and deaths 16.27) compared to countries with low temperatures (cases 1685.99; and deaths 86.40).

Further, the volume of interest rapidly increased in March 2020 when stay-at-home orders were issued. The share of media devoted to flour-related food safety risks or associated illness were extremely small but generally corresponded with flour recall announcements or other public risk communications. Overall, the interest in flour and its use remains seasonal and predictably related to societal trends, such as increased baking at home during the holidays or 2020 stay-at-home orders.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 20 patients (26 tumors) scheduled to undergo thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection between April 2016 and October 2018. Ultrasonographic tumor detection was performed with an ARIETTA 850 and L51K probe (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Ultrasonography was repeated after achieving adequate lung collapse under a positive intrathoracic pressure of 8-15 mmHg. The appearance on preoperative CT versus the ultrasonographic localization was compared for each tumor. The receiver operating characteristic curves were compared for the tumor dimension of the lung window, consolidation dimension of the lung window, tumor dimension of the mediastinal window (MD), and tumor depth from the lung surface. RESULTS: The average age was 62 years (range 42-79 years), average pathological tumor size was 9 mm (range 3-22 mm), and average tumor depth was 6 mm (range 1-25 mm). Although no tumors could be visualized before lung collapse, 22 tumors (85%) were detectable with ultrasonography after lung collapse. Of these 22 tumors, 16 were well-depicted, while six were poorly delineated. MD showed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.81), and tumors with a MD of &#8804; 6 mm had a high risk of difficult localization using ultrasonography.

Most companies use accounting variables or financial market data models to value stock prices. Design/methodology/approach - This study focuses on companies that traded at the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2018-2021. The valuation techniques are based on accounting variables, such as book value, income, research and development costs, and cash flow. It also involves analyzing data from financial markets, including interest, market value, and beta. Findings - The results show that investors should give more weight to accounting data when evaluating viable investment options to rely on financial market data. Therefore, the accounting standard regulators should continually update accounting methods that guide investors on the quality of financial reports. Furthermore, using the market data (CAPM) and the Ohlson accounting data model in estimating the price of stocks relates to two variables utilized in explaining each model. One such variable was the prices in the Ohlson model, which had a positive correlation with stock prices. Limitations- This study used Ohlson price model for accounting data. However, many studies do not use this model in predicting stock prices. It is often used in predicting company wealth. The study used CAPM and Ohlson since these models can predict stock prices though not often. Originality/value - The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the two models in predicting stock prices and returns using accounting and market during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. ? 2021.

We do not have to explain the human economy in the context of only social rules or natural laws independently from each other. Not only can we use both social rules and physical laws to assess the constraints and possibilities for future energy and economic scenarios, we absolutely must. In assessing the current state of society and possible future trajectories, we can and should update our assessments and narratives to be consistent with observations. There are many ways to think about what the future might hold, and many ways to be wrong. This chapter summarizes a set of four different broad trajectories for the future, ranging from continuous growth and technological advancement to collapse. In this chapter the reader is asked to contemplate and continue a discussion whether we can understand why certain policies and forms of economic organization endure more than others. Can we control, or should we kill the economic superorganism that seems to pursue economic growth and increasing energy consumption? We are caught in a conundrum. On one hand the individualistic and profit-seeking structure of the economic superorganism is what drives innovation, creativity, and the ability to both create and solve energy and environmental problems. We seem to want this feature. On the other hand, the biophysical nature of the superorganism means that physical limits and natural laws constrain its space of solutions such that we might not be able to solve all social and environmental problems simultaneously. We might not want these physical constraints, but we have to deal with them. The chapter includes thinking of this conundrum via a few tradeoffs: between increasing labor productivity and meaningful employment; between economic growth (and increasing consumption) and competing approaches (e.g., carbon prices, federal plans, divestment from fossil fuels) to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. It is these tradeoff conversations that can best prepare us for the future such that we are not as surprised or confused as we otherwise might be.","output":"Scenarios and Trends of the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major challenge for health services worldwide is in providing adequate medical care during mass disasters. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights this difficulty. Patient surge, a consequence of most types of disasters that contribute to trauma experiences, is a primary factor in disrupting such care as it is composed of worried well persons and those experiencing psychosocial trauma that can severely disrupt and overwhelm effective acute hospital based health care. We review the literature and propose a potential solution framework to reduce such a surge that relies on exploiting community social networks as first responders. We utilize and integrate literature based evidence on patient surge, community disaster behaviors and community based informal social networks to examine reasons for patient surge to hospitals. We then propose that leveraging community based social networks as a potent deterrent for non-critically injured, especially those who have experienced psychosocial trauma or the worried well, from seeking hospital care during ongoing disasters. By emphasizing the social capital inherent in community based social networks, this perspective posits an alternative cost-effective means of reducing patient surge.","output":"Reducing patient surge: community based social networks as first responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease is a critical drug target for small molecule COVID-19 therapy, given its likely druggability and essentiality in the viral maturation and replication cycle.

However, there is potential for Quality Improvement (QI) teams to improve pain management by visualising and exploring pain data sets. Although dashboards are already used by QI teams in hospitals, there is limited evidence of teams accessing visualisations to support their decision making. This study aims to identify the needs of the QI team in a UK Critical Care Unit (CCU) and develop dashboards that visualise longitudinal data on the efficacy of patient pain management to assist the team in making informed decisions to improve pain management within the CCU. This research is based on an analysis of transcripts of interviews with healthcare professionals with a variety of roles in the CCU and their evaluation of probes. We identified two key uses of pain data: direct patient care (focusing on individual patient data) and QI (aggregating data across the CCU and over time); in this paper, we focus on the QI role. We have identified how CCU staff currently interpret information and determine what supplementary information can better inform their decision making and support sensemaking. From these, a set of data visualisations has been proposed, for integration with the hospital electronic health record. These visualisations are being iteratively refined in collaboration with CCU staff and technical staff responsible for maintaining the electronic health record.

The mechanisms underlying these relationships are not currently known. We aim to assess whether PM affects the developing brains of schoolchildren in Poland, a European country characterized by very high levels of particulate air pollution. Methods Between 2020 and 2022, 800 children aged 10 to 13 years are being recruited as participants in a case-control study. Cases (children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) are being recruited from psychology clinics. Population-based controls are being sampled from schools. The study area comprises 18 towns in southern Poland characterized by wide-ranging levels of PM. Comprehensive psychological assessments are being conducted to assess cognitive and social functioning. Cases and controls undergo MRI including T1, T2 and MP2RAGE structural imaging, task (Go/NoGo) and resting-state MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Concentrations of PM are being assessed using land use regression models, which incorporate data from air monitoring networks, dispersion models, and characteristics of roads and other land cover types. The estimated concentrations will be assigned to prenatal and postnatal residential and preschool/school addresses of all study subjects. We will assess whether long-term exposure to outdoor PM affects brain function, structure, and connectivity in healthy children and those diagnosed with ADHD.

The objective is to describe the demand-based series of RT-PCR determinations received at a Microbiology Service at a third-level reference hospital for a health area for three months spanning from the onset of the epidemic by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the total of the RT-PCR requested in the Microbiology Service analyzed from 02/25/2020 to 05/26/2020 (90 days) has been carried out. They have been grouped by epidemiological weeks and by the petitioner service. A descriptive analysis was carried out by age, gender and number of requests for each patient. In the tests carried out, a confidence level of 95% (p <0.05) was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 27,106 requests was received corresponding to 22,037 patients. Median age 53.7 (RIC 40.9-71.7) years, women: 61.3%. Proportion of patients with any positive RT-PCR: 14%. Of the total requests for RT-PCR, positive 3,710.

The effects of antiseptic incorporation on the stability, release of sericin, and short-term and long-term (6 months) antimicrobial activity of the sericin dressing against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were investigated. We showed that the incorporation of each antiseptic did not have significant effect on the internal morphology (pore size ~ 73-105 m), elasticity (Young's modulus ~ 200-500 kPa), and the sericin release behavior of the sericin-based dressing. The release of sericin from the dressing was prolonged over 120 h and thereafter. Comparing among three antiseptics, 0.05% chlorhexidine incorporated in the sericin dressing showed the highest immediate and long-term (6 months) antimicrobial effect (largest inhibition zone) against most bacteria either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. The in vivo safety test following ISO10993 standard (Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 6: Tests for local effects after implantation) confirmed that the sericin dressing incorporating 0.05% chlorhexidine did not irritate to tissue, comparing with the commercial material used generally in clinic (Allevyn?, Smith & Nephew). We suggested the sericin dressing incorporating 0.05% chlorhexidine for the treatment of infected chronic wound.

This study was performed to assess their relationship and to provide a tool to predict patient socioeconomic factors associated with risk for delay. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was reviewed between 2004 and 2017 for patients with non-metastatic breast cancer managed with upfront surgery. Times to treatment were measured from the date of diagnosis. Patient, tumor, and treatment factors were assessed with attention paid to sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: 514,187 patients remained after exclusions, with 84.3% White, 10.8% Black, 3.7% Asian, and Hispanics comprising 5.6% of the cohort. Medicaid and uninsured patients had longer mean adjusted time to surgery ( 46 days) versus private (36.7 days), Medicare (35.9 days), or other governmental insurance (39.8 days). After adjustment, Black race and Hispanic ethnicity were most impactful, adding 6.0 and 6.4 preoperative days, 10.9 and 11.5 days to chemotherapy, 11.1 and 9.1 days to radiation, and 12.5 and 8.9 days to endocrine therapy, respectively. Income, education, and insurance, among other factors, also affected delay. A nomogram, including race and sociodemographic factors, was created to predict the risk of preoperative delay. CONCLUSION: Significant disparities exist in timeliness of care for factors, including but not limited to, race and ethnicity. Although exact causes cannot be discerned, these data indicate population subsets whose intervals of care risk being longer than those specified by national quality standards.

Basigin also has a well-established role in Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection of human erythrocytes where it is bound by one of the parasites invasion ligands, reticulocyte binding protein homolog 5 (RH5). Here, we sought to validate the claim that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein can form a complex with basigin, using RH5-basigin as a positive control. Using recombinantly expressed proteins, size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance, we show that neither RBD nor full-length spike glycoprotein bind to recombinant human basigin (either expressed in E. coli or mammalian cells). Given the immense interest in SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic targets, we would caution the inclusion of basigin in this list on the basis of its reported direct interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.

Critical to these efforts is the identification of host factors that are essential to viral entry and replication. Basigin, or CD147, was previously identified as a possible therapeutic target based on the observation that it may act as a co-receptor for SARS-COV-2, binding to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein.

This study examined the association between diaper need and risk for food insecurity in a statewide sample of participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Families enrolled in Vermont WIC in August 2019 were invited to an online survey. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the relationship between risk for food insecurity measured by the Hunger Vital Sign tool and diaper need, with and without adjustment for household factors. Follow-up questions asked those with diaper need what they do when they run out of diapers and those without diaper need how they access enough diapers. Complete data were available for 501 households. Over half (52.3%) were at risk for food insecurity and nearly one-third (32.5%) reported diaper need. The odds of experiencing risk for food insecurity were 3.852 (95% CI=2.557, 5.803) times greater for families with diaper need than for families that had enough diapers. The association persisted with adjustment for location, age of respondent, number of children in diapers, and length of time participating in WIC (adjusted OR=4.036, 95% CI=2.645, 6.160).

METHODS An invitation to submit cases of challenges or errors in genetic testing was issued to the general National Society of Genetic Counselors Listserv, the National Society of Genetic Counselors Cancer Special Interest Group members, as part of a case series with Precision Oncology News, and via social media (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). Deidentified clinical documentation was requested and reviewed when available. Thirty-three cases were submitted, reviewed, and accepted. A thematic analysis was performed. Submitters were asked to approve cases before submission. RESULTS All cases took place in the United States, involved hereditary cancer testing and/or findings in cancer predisposition genes, and involved medical-grade genetic testing, direct-to-consumer testing, or research genetic testing. In 9 cases, test results were misinterpreted, leading to incorrect screening or risk-reducing procedures being performed/recommended. In 5 cases, incorrect or unnecessary testing was ordered/recommended. In 3 cases, incorrect clinical diagnoses were made, or opportunities for diagnoses were delayed. In 3 cases, errors or challenges arose related to medical intervention after testing or reported genetic diagnosis. In 2 cases, physicians provided incorrect information related to the inheritance pattern of a syndrome. In 2 cases, there were challenges related to the interpretation of genetic variants. In 2 cases, challenges arose after direct-to-consumer testing. One case involved test results that should never have been reported based on sample quality. In 1 case, a patient presented a falsified test result. In 5 cases, multiple errors were made. DISCUSSION As genetic testing continues to become more complicated and common, it is critical that patients and nongenetics providers have access to accurate and timely genetic counseling information. Even as multiple medical bodies highlight the value of genetic counselors (GCs), tension exists in the genomics community as GCs work toward licensure and Medicare provider status. It is critical that health care communities leverage, rather than restrict, the expertise and experience of GCs so that patients can benefit from, and not be harmed by, genetic testing. In order to responsibly democratize genomics, it will be important for genetics and nongenetic health care providers to collaborate and use alternative service delivery models and technology solutions at point of care.

We have developed an ambulatory medical device that allows vestibular telemetry to record eye movements over a 30-day period to aid the diagnosis of vertigo. We have undertaken proof-of-concept work to identify unique properties of nystagmus that could be used to differentiate between three of the most common causes of vertigo: Mnire's disease, vestibular migraine, and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. PATIENTS We analyze the nystagmus from patients with a diagnosis of Mnire's disease, vestibular migraine, and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. INTERVENTIONS Our vestibular telemetry system includes a wearable, ambulatory monitor which continuously records horizontal and vertical eye-movements, as well as three-axis movements of the head. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Horizontal and vertical eye-movement data, and three-axis head positioning data. RESULTS Sixteen participants were enrolled onto the study and three reported experiencing rotatory vertigo during their 30-day trial, confirmed by the presence of nystagmus in their eye-movement traces. Vestibular telemetry revealed distinct differences between the nystagmus produced during an acute Mnire's attack, and attacks of vestibular migraine and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Attack frequency, nystagmus duration, whether the nystagmus onset was motion provoked, nystagmus direction, slow phase velocity, and slow phase duration were found to be discriminatory features that could be exploited to allow an automated diagnosis to be made.

This study aimed to assess circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines in adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and stratified according to age (older or younger than 65 years) aiming to explore associations between these markers of inflammation and comorbidities. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 142 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the University Hospital of the Federal University of S?o Carlos, from July to October 2020. Sociodemographic data, chronic comorbidities, and baseline NEWS2 and SOFA for clinical deterioration were obtained at hospital admission. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Older adults with COVID-19 had higher serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 as compared to those under 65 years of age (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). IL-10 was independently associated with age (p = 0.04) and severity of the disease (p = 0.05), whereas serum levels of IL-6 were not directly associated with age (p = 0.5). The comorbidity index seems to be the main responsible for this, being significantly associated with IL-6 levels among those aged 65 and over (p = 0.007), in addition to the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 are associated with the severity of the disease and a higher comorbidity index among adults aged 65 and over with COVID-19.

The proportion of purchasing fruits and vegetables per week rose among intervention participants at 3 and 6 months compared to control participants (0.2% versus ?3.0%, P = 0.22; 1.7% versus ?3.5%, P = 0.05, respectively). Store sales of confectionery were lower in intervention stores than predicted at 3 (?1.05 SDs (?1.98, ?0.12), P = 0.03) and 6 months (?1.37 SDs (?2.95, 0.22), P = 0.09), equivalent to approximately 1,359 and approximately 1,575 fewer portions per store, per week, respectively; no differences were observed for confectionery purchasing. Changes in dietary variables were predominantly in the expected direction for health benefit. Intervention implementation was not within control of the research team, and stores could not be randomised. It is a pilot study, and, therefore, not powered to detect an effect. CONCLUSIONS: Healthier supermarket layouts can improve the nutrition profile of store sales and likely improve household purchasing and dietary quality. Placing fruits and vegetables near store entrances should be considered alongside policies to limit prominent placement of unhealthy foods.

METHODS: We conducted an outbreak investigation and case-control study to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk in an outbreak among HCP at an academic medical center in California that was confirmed by whole genome sequencing. Results: A total of 7/9 cases and 93/182 controls completed a voluntary survey about risk factors. Compared to controls, cases reported significantly more patient contact time. Cases were also significantly more likely to have performed airway procedures on the index patient, particularly placing the patient on high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) (OR=11.6; 95% CI=1.7-132.1). DISCUSSION: This study highlights the risk of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 from patients who become infectious midway into their hospitalization. Our findings also reinforce the importance of patient contact and aerosol-generating procedures as key risk factors for HCP infection with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Re-testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 after admission in suspicious cases and using N95 masks for all aerosol-generating procedures regardless of initial patient SARS-CoV-2 test results can help reduce the risk of SARS-COV-2 transmission to HCP.","output":"Case-control study evaluating risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 outbreak amongst healthcare personnel at a tertiary care center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, health systems and care approaches vary widely due to local reality, distance to facilities, cultural norms, resources, staff availability, geography, and politics. Consequently, globally maternal-newborn dyad care and outcomes are highly variable, leading to approximately 800 maternal deaths daily with a 100-fold difference among high- and low-resource countries. Irrespective of where care is received, maternal safety and wellbeing should be preserved. Despite ongoing efforts, however, this is not the case. Large gaps exist between spending and clinical outcomes. Segmented health care, coupled with poor planning and inadequate resource distribution, results in failure to provide essential life-saving treatment. The proposed solution is a regional integrated care model from midwife to advanced level III/IV care and the newborn unit, achieved through effective coordination by site, staff, and clinicians. This model has been successfully implemented in high- to low-resource countries in the past 20 years. In the large diverse population of the United States, constructive steps have been implemented to reduce high maternal mortality in black and rural communities.

This study aimed to identify risk factors for poor mental health and stress coping strategies among healthcare college students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted over 7 consecutive days starting on 28 April 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. The survey assessed socioeconomic characteristics and the General Health Questionnaire-12 score, self-reported health status, anxiety, and satisfaction with daily life, work, leisure, and new activities. Approximately 70% of 223 respondents had poor mental health. Less communication with friends was the main risk factor for mental health problems. Good health status and satisfaction with leisure and new activities were associated with reduced risk of mental health problems. Students with poor mental health tended to seek social support as a stress coping strategy.

The purpose of this study was to discover research that can contribute to understanding decentralisation as one strategy for resolving challenges in healthcare service delivery organisations. This scoping review provides examples and research-informed guidance for decentralisation research, planning and implementation. FINDINGS There is limited empirical research into management decentralisation within primary and community care, but some useful frameworks for assessing and planning decentralisation. Rapid changes are being made to workforce redesign, substitution and patient co-production. Research into such 'micro-decentralisation' is not considered in the decentralisation literature. Neither is how the context of culture, systems and regulations affects implementation of this type of decentralisation. Our recent experience suggests that management decentralisation can enable fast and effective local changes to respond to the evolving Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS COV-2) pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Decentralisation can create conditions that support innovation and improvement locally to develop primary and community care. Managers and policy makers can use an appropriate decentralisation strategy to address challenges in workforce retention and recruitment, rising care demands and expectations of patients.

However, within the large Nsp3 (1922 amino-acid residues), the structure and function of the so-called SARS-unique domain (SUD) have remained elusive. SUD occurs only in SARS-CoV and the highly related viruses found in certain bats, but is absent from all other coronaviruses. Therefore, it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, compared to other coronaviruses, most of which cause only mild infections in humans. In order to help elucidate the function of the SUD, we have determined crystal structures of fragment 389C652 (SUD(core)) of Nsp3, which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain. Both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (2.2 and 2.8 ? resolution, respectively) revealed that SUD(core) forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, with a macrodomain fold similar to the SARS-CoV X-domain. However, in contrast to the latter, SUD fails to bind ADP-ribose, as determined by zone-interference gel electrophoresis. Instead, the entire SUD(core) as well as its individual subdomains interact with oligonucleotides known to form G-quadruplexes. This includes oligodeoxy- as well as oligoribonucleotides. Mutations of selected lysine residues on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain lead to reduction of G-quadruplex binding, whereas mutations in the SUD-M subdomain abolish it. As there is no evidence for Nsp3 entering the nucleus of the host cell, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA or host-cell mRNA containing long G-stretches may be targets of SUD. The SARS-CoV genome is devoid of G-stretches longer than 5C6 nucleotides, but more extended G-stretches are found in the 3-nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding for certain host-cell proteins involved in apoptosis or signal transduction, and have been shown to bind to SUD in vitro. Therefore, SUD may be involved in controlling the host cell's response to the viral infection. Possible interference with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like domains is also discussed.","output":"The SARS-Unique Domain (SUD) of SARS Coronavirus Contains Two Macrodomains That Bind G-Quadruplexes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-COV2 virus causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern The novel coronavirus (2019) was discovered in 2019 in Wuhan, the market of the wet animal, China with viral pneumonia cases and is life-threatening Today, WHO announces COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic COVID-19 is likely to be zoonotic It is transmitted from bats as intermediary animals to human Also, the virus is transmitted from human to human who is in close contact with others The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease Treatment is nearly supportive;the role of antiviral agents is yet to be established The SARS-COV2 virus spreads faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatal-ity In this article, we aimed to summarize the transmission, symptoms, patho-genesis, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine to control the spread of this fatal disease","output":"SARS-CoV2 virus and coronavirus disease (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus We reported a 59-year-old Yemeni physician who was treated at home with complaints of COVID-19 symptoms After receiving the treatment according to the COVID-19 guidelines established in Yemen, the patient made a slow recovery from 8 May 2020 to 28 May 2020 In conclusion, COVID-19 has a complicated clinical course and poor prognosis Nevertheless, early aggressive treatment with an appropriate protocol could improve patient outcomes However, in COVID-19, the thyroid gland plays a role in the immune system and medical professionals should consider assessing the thyroid gland in COVID-19 cases","output":"A Case Report of COVID-19 in Yemen: Detailed Clinical Observations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the overall education system in general and medical education in particular.

The degree of variability between immunoassays targeting anti-nucleocapsid (anti-NP; the majority) vs the potentially neutralising anti-spike antibodies (including anti-receptor-binding domain; anti-RBD), particularly in mild or asymptomatic disease, remains unclear. AIMS: We aimed to explore variability in anti-NP and anti-RBD antibody detectability following mild symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyse antibody response for correlation with symptomatology. METHODS: A multicentre prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken (AprilCJuly 2020). Paired serum samples were tested for anti-NP and anti-RBD IgG antibodies and reactivity expressed as binding ratios (BR). Multivariate linear regression was performed analysing age, sex, time since onset, symptomatology, anti-NP and anti-RBD antibody BR. RESULTS: We included 906 adults. Antibody results (793/906; 87.5%; 95% confidence interval: 85.2C89.6) and BR strongly correlated ( = 0.75). PCR-confirmed cases were more frequently identified by anti-RBD (129/130) than anti-NP (123/130). Anti-RBD testing identified 83 of 325 (25.5%) cases otherwise reported as negative for anti-NP. Anti-NP presence (+1.75/unit increase; p < 0.001), fever ( 38C; +1.81; p < 0.001) or anosmia (+1.91; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased anti-RBD BR.

CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG showed significant correlation with anti-NP IgG for absolute seroconversion and BR. Higher BR were seen in symptomatic individuals, particularly those with fever. Inter-assay variability (12.5%) was evident and raises considerations for optimising seroprevalence testing strategies/studies.","output":"Variability in detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses following mild infection: a prospective multicentre cross-sectional study, London, United Kingdom, 17 April to 17 July 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, coronavirus infection hit Wuhan, China, and spread throughout South Korea, Italy, Iran, the USA, and the rest of the world Medical scientists worked tirelessly to develop vaccines WHO introduced preventive/protective measures to reduce human-human transmission, while researchers are searching for alternative technologies in AI, ML, and feature engineering to improve medical test accuracy, perfect isolation, and disease control Recent research unraveled radiology imaging techniques that predict fast spread and have accurate diagnosis by confirming pathogens in blood cells Machine learning techniques utilized to identify and diagnose COVID-19 are medic-tech applications for analyzing pneumonic effects of the virus in the body ML approaches can help to examine the heart through chest X-rays to reveal how it affects the lungs, kidney, liver, and other vital organs in the body X-ray accuracy can be analyzed with multinomial MNB, ANN, SVM, GANS, and other deep learning tools that validate scan results Data authenticity above 85% may depend on computed algorithms that show whether COVID-19 nucleic acid test results are negative or positive Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a series of DNA samples for performing genetic test analysis PCR helps experts to predict COVID-19 infectious agents using human DNA samples However, PCR that supposes to show how COVID-19 spreads can be influenced by medical protocols causing further contaminations Alternative use of technology has brought about an automated response while using CNN (convolutional neural network) to predict viruses and offer diagnostic options Chest X-ray images can easily be classified using ML fractional multi-channel exponent moments (FrMEMS) to indicate infected patients The relevant approach needed to achieve fractional multi-channels exponent process involves the adoption of parallel computational methods that accelerates, modifies, and optimizes Manta Ray Foraging to improve dataset accuracy from 85% to 98% This report on machine learning techniques for identification and diagnosis of COVID-19, discussed ML performance techniques, identifying image process applications, image classification & analysis with ML, data segmentation, machine learning methods;that classifies x-ray scans, determine rates of COVID-19 spread, normal & abnormal cases, and recommend preventive measures ?

Results: : The prevalence of COVID-19 is significantly less in RPs than in the healthy population.Moreover, patients who were under treatment with biologic diseas-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs(DMARDs) and IS drugs had milder symptoms in the case of COVID-19. Two RPs died from COVID-19, both of whom had granulomatosis and polyangiitis (GPA). Conclusion: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the RPs was lower than the general population, which was determined to be associated with more adherence to the quarantine and social distancing rules by RPs. Besides, using leflunomide (a DMARD) and IS drugs might have a protective effect against severe COVID-19.","output":"Prevalence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Rheumatic Patients and Evaluation of The Effect of Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 can be divided into three clinical stages, and one can speculate that these stages correlate with where the infection resides. For the asymptomatic phase, the infection mostly resides in the nose, where it elicits a minimal innate immune response. For the mildly symptomatic phase, the infection is mostly in the pseudostratified epithelium of the larger airways and is accompanied by a more vigorous innate immune response. In the conducting airways, the epithelium can recover from the infection, because the keratin 5 basal cells are spared and they are the progenitor cells for the bronchial epithelium. There may be more severe disease in the bronchioles, where the club cells are likely infected. The devastating third phase is in the gas exchange units of the lung, where ACE2-expressing alveolar type II cells and perhaps type I cells are infected. The loss of type II cells results in respiratory insufficiency due to the loss of pulmonary surfactant, alveolar flooding, and possible loss of normal repair, since type II cells are the progenitors of type I cells. The loss of type I and type II cells will also block normal active resorption of alveolar fluid. Subsequent endothelial damage leads to transudation of plasma proteins, formation of hyaline membranes, and an inflammatory exudate, characteristic of ARDS. Repair might be normal, but if the type II cells are severely damaged alternative pathways for epithelial repair may be activated, which would result in some residual lung disease.","output":"Thoughts on the alveolar phase of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Letter we show that multiband observations of stellar-mass binary black holes by the next generation of ground-based observatories (3G) and the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) would facilitate a comprehensive test of general relativity by simultaneously measuring all the post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients.

One important precursor currently used for the production of Relenza, an antiviral product from GlaxoSmithKline, is N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc). This substance has a considerably high market price despite efforts to develop cost-reducing (biotechnological) production processes. Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) is a saprophyte noted for its abundant secretion of hydrolytic enzymes and its potential to degrade chitin to its monomer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Chitin is considered the second most abundant biomass available on earth and therefore an attractive raw material. RESULTS: In this study, we introduced two enzymes from bacterial origin into Hypocrea, which convert GlcNAc into NeuNAc via N-acetylmannosamine. This enabled the fungus to produce NeuNAc from the cheap starting material chitin in liquid culture. Furthermore, we expressed the two recombinant enzymes as GST-fusion proteins and developed an enzyme assay for monitoring their enzymatic functionality. Finally, we demonstrated that Hypocrea does not metabolize NeuNAc and that no NeuNAc-uptake by the fungus occurs, which are important prerequisites for a potential production strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a proof of concept for the possibility to engineer in a filamentous fungus a bacterial enzyme cascade, which is fully functional. Furthermore, it provides the basis for the development of a process for NeuNAc production as well as a general prospective design for production processes that use saprophytes as whole-cell catalysts.","output":"Synthesis of an antiviral drug precursor from chitin using a saprophyte as a whole-cell catalyst"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this short report the authors characterise inpatient bed occupancy and predicted rehabilitation need of patients cared for in two acute hospitals of a large London NHS Trust during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, including 394 people with confirmed COVID-19 Data were captured on a single day (17th April 2020) from the two Trust hospitals to inform discharge planning in line with national COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service policy guidance Our data suggests that the proportion of COVID-19 patients predicted to require rehabilitation upon hospital discharge may be greater than the estimates described in the national COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service policy guidance;posing the question is there a demand - capacity mismatch between rehabilitation need and service provision as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?","output":"A demandcapacity mismatch between rehabilitation need and service provision as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?

Approved COVID\\\\19 case was considered as a person with a positive respiratory sample performed by at least one of two RT\\\\PCR methods or genetic sequencing. ANOVA repeated measure, independent t\\\\test and logistic regression were done. A P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.93  17.92 years. Regarding gender, there were 91 females (42.3%) and 124 males (57.7%). The mean hospital stay, the temperature at admission, and onset of symptoms were 4.91  3.68 days, 37.40  0.96C and 5.88  4.80 days, respectively. Close contact with suspected people was found in 10.2% of patients. Additionally, 44 patients (20.5%) were smokers. Shortness of breath and cough were found in 62.8% and 49.3% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities of patients. Regarding lung involvement, 33 patients (33%) were normal, most of the patients (n = 71) had 5%\\\\25% involvement in their lung and a minority of patients (n = 13) had a severe condition of 50%\\\\75% lung involvement.

In this study, we identified an epitope-based vaccine that could be an optimal solution for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection. By deploying an immunoinformatics approach, we predicted a subunit vaccine based on the surface glycoprotein (S protein) of MERS-CoV. For this purpose, the proteome of the MERS-CoV spike protein was obtained from the NCBI GenBank database. Then, it was subjected to a check for allergenicity using the Allergen FP v.1.0 tool. The Vaxijen v.2.0 tool was used to conduct antigenicity tests for binding with major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules. The solidity of the predicted epitope-allele docked complex was evaluated by a molecular dynamics simulation. After docking a total of eight epitopes from the MERS-CoV S protein, further analyses predicted their non-toxicity and therapeutic immunogenic properties.

However, the function of NLRP3 inflammasome in host immunological responses to the lethal H7N9 virus is still obscure. Here, we demonstrated that mice deficient for NLRP3 inflammasome components, including NLRP3, caspase-1, and Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), were less susceptible to H7N9 viral challenge than wild type (WT) controls. Inflammasome deficiency in these animals led to significantly milder mortality and less pulmonary inflammation compared with WT mice. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor deficient mice also exhibited a higher survival rate than WT controls. Thus, our study reveals that the NLRP3 inflammasome is deleterious for the host during H7N9 infection in mice, which is due to an overwhelming inflammatory response via caspase-1 activation and associated IL-1 signal. Therefore, fine-tuning the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome or IL-1 signaling may be beneficial for the host to control H7N9 associated lethal pathogenesis.","output":"The H7N9 influenza A virus infection results in lethal inflammation in the mammalian host via the NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread school closures, reducing access to school meals for millions of students previously participating in the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National School Lunch Program (NSLP).

We extracted data on demographic information, reasons for ED visits/revisits, health insurance coverage, weekend ED arrival, and mortality. RESULTS: A sample of 24,206 ED discharges for 19,697 adults with at least one chronic disease was included in the analysis. The rate of 72-hour revisits in this study population was high: 3,144/24,206 (13%) had the first revisit and 319/3,144 (10.1%) had the second ED revisit within 72 hours.

The goal of this project is to determine and compare the utility of certain containment strategies including gateway testing, surveillance testing, and contact tracing as well as individual level control measures such as mask wearing and social distancing. We modify a standard SEIR-type model to reflect what is currently known about COVID-19. We also modify the model to reflect the population present on a college campus, separating it into students and faculty. This is done in order to capture the expected different contact rates between groups as well as the expected difference in outcomes based on age known for COVID-19. We aim to provide insight into which strategies are most effective, rather than predict exact numbers of infections. We analyze effectiveness by looking at relative changes in the total number of cases as well as the effect a measure has on the estimated basic reproductive number. We find that the total number of infections is most sensitive to parameters relating to student behaviors. We also find that contact tracing can be an effective control strategy when surveillance testing is unavailable. Lastly, we validate the model using data from Villanova University's online COVID-19 Dashboard from Fall 2020 and find good agreement between model and data when superspreader events are incorporated in the model as shocks to the number of infected individuals approximately two weeks after each superspreader event.","output":"Mathematical modelling of the spread of COVID-19 on a university campus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate: 1) whether baseline non-flourishing mental health is associated with a higher probability of all-cause mortality over 18-year follow-up after controlling for many risk factors for premature mortality; and 2) what other factors, independent of mental health status, are associated with all-cause mortality after adjustment for known risk factors. METHODS: Data were derived from waves 1 and 9 (1994/1995; 2010/2011) of the Canadian National Population Health Survey. An analytic sample of 12,424 participants 18 years and above was selected. Baseline information on flourishing and predictors of all-cause mortality was from wave 1 and mortality data was ascertained by the Canadian Vital Statistics-Death Database in wave 9. Mean time to all-cause mortality was estimated using Kaplan-Meir procedure. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of baseline non-flourishing mental health and potential predictors with time to all-cause mortality. RESULTS: About one in five participants was classified as non-flourishing at baseline. At the end of the study period 2317 deaths were observed. Baseline non-flourishing mental health was associated with a 19% higher probability of all-cause mortality during 18-year follow-up (HR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.08C1.32), corresponding to a 4.7-month shorter survival time. After controlling for baseline chronic health conditions, past-year depression, sociodemographics, health behaviors, social support, pain and functioning, baseline non-flourishing mental health status was associated with a 14% higher probability of death (HR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.02C1.27). CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal mental health is associated with premature mortality even after accounting for many risk factors for early death.

Low absorption of oral administered TFB may cause elevated concentrations in the feces discharged from the salmon into the benthic environment. The polychaete Capitella sp. are often dominant in such habitats and consume organic waste deposited on the sediment. In the present study, Capitella sp. were exposed to doses of TFB in salmon feed of 1, 2 and 4 g TFB kg-1 (0 g TFB kg-1 in control group) over an experimental period of 32 days. Cumulative mortality was 12%-15% in both treatment groups with 1 and 2 g TFB kg-1 and reached 27% in the group with 4 g TFB kg-1. Only the highest dose (4 g TFB kg-1) negatively affected feed intake, growth and respiration of the polychaetes while food conversion efficiency was not affected. At the end of the experiment, the concentrations of TFB in the Capitella sp. were high, in the range of 9.24-10.32 g g-1 for the three treatment groups. It was suggested that a maximum level of absorption rate was reached, also for the lowest dose. High concentrations of TFB in the Capitella sp. might pose a risk to crustaceans that forage for polychaetes in the vicinity of fish farms. We conclude that the effects of TFB on Capitella sp. may therefore primarily be to the predators rather than the Capitella sp.","output":"The effects of teflubenzuron on mortality, physiology and accumulation in Capitella sp."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemos ledo con sumo inters el artculo publicado por Diguez-Campa, et al.1, titulado The 2020 research pandemic: a bibliometric analysis of publications on COVID-19 and their scientific impact during the first months, en el que los autores hacen un excelente e innovador anlisis bibliomtrico sobre la publicacin cientfica mdica en los primeros meses de desarrollo de la pandemia de COVID-19.","output":"[?Conflictos de intereses ocultos en publicaciones cientficas en tiempos de COVID-19?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe an 8-week-old infant with severe gastrointestinal symptoms, significant hypoalbuminemia, and mild carditis following asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Jejunal segments were mounted in Ussing chambers at stages of the infection, and permeability was measured using three probe molecules of differing molecular weights. In control tissue, permeability to horseradish peroxidase was 2.6 times higher across segments with Peyer's patches than across segments without Peyer's patches, whereas polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeabilities were the same in patch and nonpatch segments. Twelve hours after infection, when virus had invaded the mucosa causing a structural lesion, and before diarrhea had begun, horseradish peroxidase permeability increased in non-patch-containing segments to equal that across patch-containing tissue. At this early 12-h stage, polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeation were unchanged in patchcontaining segments compared with controls. Ninety-six hours after transmissible gastroenteritis infection, when diarrhea was severe, horseradish peroxidase permeability in patch-free segments had returned to normal and patch-containing tissue permeability was diminished below control levels. Increased macromolecular permeability appears to occur only in the very early invasive stage of this viral enteritis and only in patch-free segments.

AIMS To assess the functionality, perceived safety, droplet protection and aerosol protection of several barrier techniques. METHODS Firstly, a simulation study with 12 different laryngoscopists was conducted to assess the time taken to perform an intubation (via direct laryngoscopy, via video laryngoscopy and via a bougie) with four different barrier techniques (personal protective equipment only, a plastic sheet, a tented plastic sheet and an intubation box). Secondly, a cough at the time of intubation was simulated using ultraviolet dye to assess the spread of droplets; and thirdly, smoke was used to assess the spread of aerosols. RESULTS Intubation time using the box was non-inferior to using no barrier. Based on subjective ratings by the laryngoscopists, the most functional technique was no barrier followed by the intubation box, then the tented sheet, then the plastic sheet. The technique that conferred the highest feeling of safety to the laryngoscopists was the intubation box, followed by the tented sheet, then no barrier and then the plastic sheet. All the barriers prevented the ultraviolet dye contaminating the head and torso of the laryngoscopist. Smoke remained within the intubation box if plastics sheets were used to cover the openings and suction was ineffective at clearing it. With no barrier in place, smoke was effectively cleared away from the patient in a theatre with laminar flow but tended to spread up toward the laryngoscopist in a room without laminar flow. CONCLUSIONS A well-designed intubation box is an effective barrier against droplets and is non-inferior to no barrier in relation to intubation time.However, a box interferes with laminar flow in theatres with formal ventilation systems and may result in accumulation of aerosols if it is completely enclosed.","output":"A comparison of anesthetic protective barriers for the management of COVID-19 pediatric patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the entire world by storm.

So far, there are no specific treatments with proven high efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Presently, several drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, favipiravir (FVP), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), remdesivir and oseltamivir, have been suggested as effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience with FPV and LPV/r in critically ill patients with COVID-19 at Sakarya University Education and Research Hospital. METHODS: The study included 107 consecutive patients who had a laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 19 March and 19 May 2020. Follow-up continued through 30 May 2020 when the last observed patients were discharged. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 107 patients, 65 received FPV (Group FPV) and 42 received LPV/r (Group LPV/r). The two groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical findings. 43 (66.2%) of the 65 patients in the FPV group and 23 (54.8%) of the 42 patients in the LPV/r group died (p = 0.237). The median ICU stay was 6.6 (IQR, 3-10) days in the FPV group and 9 (IQR, 6-16) days in the LPV/r group, which was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.010). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the FVP group compared to the LPV/r group among patients who were discharged from the ICU. Although the analysis was done with a limited number of patients and the observed difference in mortality rate is of some concern, FVP treatment may be more beneficial than LPV/r in terms of effective use in the ICU.","output":"Observational study of the effects of Favipiravir vs Lopinavir/Ritonavir on clinical outcomes in critically Ill patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental Treatment Technologies for Municipal, Industrial and Medical Wastes will provide the reader with a simple and clear path to analyze the full range of options to manage/treat any solid, hazardous, or medical waste problems/issues at hand.

Research efforts have focused on antibodies that neutralize the ACE2-Spike interaction but not on non-neutralizing antibodies. Antibody-dependent phagocytosis is an immune mechanism enhanced by opsonization, where typically, more bound antibodies trigger a stronger phagocyte response. Here, we show that Spike-specific antibodies, dependent on concentration, can either enhance or reduce Spike-bead phagocytosis by monocytes independently of the antibody neutralization potential. Surprisingly, we find that both convalescent patient plasma and patient-derived monoclonal antibodies lead to maximum opsonization already at low levels of bound antibodies and is reduced as antibody binding to Spike protein increases. Moreover, we show that this Spike-dependent modulation of opsonization seems to affect the outcome in an experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection model. These results suggest that the levels of anti-Spike antibodies could influence monocyte-mediated immune functions and propose that non-neutralizing antibodies could confer protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection by mediating phago-cytosis.","output":"Opsonization by non-neutralizing antibodies can confer protection to SARS-CoV-2 despite Spike-dependent modulation of phagocytosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Although the initial reports of COVID-19 cases in children described that children were largely protected from severe manifestations, clusters of paediatric cases of severe systemic hyperinflammation and shock related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection began to be reported in the latter half of April 2020. A novel syndrome called \\"multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\\" (MIS-C) shares common clinical features with other well-defined syndromes, including Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Our objective was to develop a protocol for the evaluation, treatment and follow-up of patients with MIS-C. METHODS: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team. We convened a multidisciplinary working group with representation from the departments of paediatric critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, surgery, gastroenterology, haematology, immunology, infectious disease and neurology. Our protocol and recommendations were based on the literature and our experiences with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. After an agreement was reached and the protocol was implemented, revisions were made on the basis of expert feedback. CONCLUSION: Children may experience acute cardiac decompensation or other organ system failure due to this severe inflammatory condition. Therefore, patients with severe symptoms of MIS-C should be managed in a paediatric intensive care setting, as rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Therapeutic approaches for MIS-C should be tailored depending on the patients' phenotypes. Plasmapheresis may be useful as a standard treatment to control hypercytokinemia in cases of MIS-C with severe symptoms.

METHODS: Digital databases were queried to study the safety of RAASi in COVID-19. The primary outcome of interest was mortality. The secondary outcome was seropositivity improvement/viral clearance, clinical manifestation progression, and progression to intensive care units. A random-effect model was used to compute an unadjusted odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: A total of 49 observational studies were included in the analysis consisting of 83,269 COVID-19 patients (RAASi n = 34,691; non-RAASi n = 48,578). The mean age of the sample was 64, and 56% were males. We found that RAASi was associated with similar mortality outcomes as compared to non-RAASi groups (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.99C1.15; p > 0.05). RAASi was associated with seropositivity improvement including negative RT-PCR or antibodies, (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93C0.99; p < 0.05). There was no association between RAASi versus control with progression to ICU admission (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79C1.23; p > 0.05) or higher odds of worsening of clinical manifestations (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97C1.11; p > 0.05). Metaregression analysis did not change our outcomes for effect modifiers including age, sex, comorbidities, RAASi type, or study type on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is not a contraindication to hold or discontinue RAASi as they are not associated with higher mortality or worsening symptoms. Continuation of RAASi might be associated with favorable outcomes in COVID-19, including seropositivity/viral clearance.

At present, there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for COVID-19. The pathogenic infectivity of the virus requires the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein to bind the host cell receptor, angiontensin converting enzyme (ACE2). While the binding to host cell receptor is the first step of infection, the entrance of the virus into the cell needs the cleavage of S1-S2 subunits to expose S2 for fusion to cell membrane via host proteases including cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, trypsin and factor Xa. Previous in vitro studies have shown that factor Xa inhibition can decrease viral infectivity. We suppose that host cell proteases including furin (as expressed highly in lungs), factor Xa and cathepsin are possible targets to decrease viral burden, therefore unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin-LMWH (specifically dalteparin and tinzaparin for their anti inflammatory action) can be potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases involved in virus infectivity. Our hypothesis needs to be tested in in vitro and clinical studies, however as we are in an urgent situation as the burden of SARS-CoV2 is increasing all around the world, we recommend the usage of unfractioned heparin or LMWH in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients with the risk-benefit judgement of the clinician.

This concerns investigations ranging from gene or genome analysis to protein structural analysis. However, the retrieval of interconnected data from a number of different databases is very often done repeatedly in an unsystematic way. RESULTS: Here, we present TAxonomy, Gene, Ontology, Protein, Structure INtegrated (TAGOPSIN), a command line program written in Java for rapid and systematic retrieval of select data from seven of the most popular public biological databases relevant to comparative genomics and protein structure studies. The program allows a user to retrieve organism-centred data and assemble them in a single data warehouse which constitutes a useful resource for several biological applications. TAGOPSIN was tested with a number of organisms encompassing eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses. For example, it successfully integrated data for about 17,000 UniProt entries of Homo sapiens and 21 UniProt entries of human coronavirus.

Consumption has become a phenomenon that turned into madness due to the acceleration of aggressive sales enhancing efforts based on fierce competition and to the fact that consumers confuse the concepts of need and desire. Confronting the consumers with easily reachable products and broad distribution channels, markets are vital institutions for people. The first aim of this study is to determine the factors increasing and decreasing customer satisfaction. The second aim is to determine whether there is a meaningful correlation between markets and demographic elements. To this end, perceptions of 407 consumers in Diyarbakir who were chosen by convenience sampling method were measured by face-to-face questions. Then their answers were subjected to frequency analysis and chi-square test. In addition, multiple logistic regression analysis has been utilized to see the model. As a result of the study, meaningful differences have been found between consumers' gender and marital status according to the markets they choose to shop. For the proposed model, gender of the customer, gender of the cashier, convenience of entering and exiting the market and satisfaction from hygiene of the market have become prominent variables increasing the satisfaction from retailing.

We assessed and compared the contribution of computed tomography (CT)-derived muscle status and lung parenchymal features in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods or Background: Clinical/laboratory data and clinical outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission and death) were retrieved retrospectively for patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction who underwent chest CT on admission in four hospitals in northern Italy from February 21 to April 30, 2020. Extent and type of pulmonary involvement, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion were assessed. Cross-sectional areas and attenuation of paravertebral muscles were measured on axial CT images at the T5 and T12 vertebral levels. Multivariate linear and binary logistic regression were used to find associations between variables in predicting ICU admission or death and to obtain predictive models, including odds ratios (ORs), tested and compared using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results or Findings: A total of 552 patients (364 men;median age: 65 years;interquartile range: 54-75) were included. In a CT-based model (including lung and muscle status), reduced paravertebral muscle area at the T5 level showed the highest ORs for ICU admission (4.83;p < .001) and death (2.25;p = .027). When this model was extended to include clinical variables, reduced paravertebral muscle area at the T5 level still showed the highest ORs both for ICU admission (4.34;p < .001) and death (2.28;p = .001). At ROC analysis comparing these models, the chest CT-based model had the same area under the curve (AUC) for ICU admission prediction (0.83;p = .380) and a nonsignificantly lower AUC for death prediction (0.86 versus 0.87;p =. 282).

This relative local ischaemia might explain pathogenesis of anal fissure, which is often located posteriorly. The aim of this study was to record the exact position of the distal branches of the superior rectal artery during Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation-rectoanal repair (HAL-RAR) procedures with special reference to posterior distribution of the arteries. METHODS All consecutive patients with symptomatic haemorrhoids who were treated with the HAL-RAR procedure between February 2008 and February 2014 in a single institution were included in the study. Number and position of Doppler-guided ligations were prospectively collected. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare artery locations. RESULTS A total of 150 patients (75 women) with symptomatic haemorrhoids were included in the study. Median age was 53 years (range 23-83). A median of 10 ligations were placed per patient (range 3-18). A significantly lower number of cumulative arterial ligations was recorded in the posterior position (88 ligations overall, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS The number of distal branches of the superior rectal artery that have been localized by the Doppler-guided HAL-RAR technique is lower at the posterior midline than in the other segments of the lower rectum. This is another evidence of the vascular deficiency at the posterior pole of the anal canal that might explain the pathogenesis of the anal fissure.","output":"Assessment of haemorrhoidal artery network using Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation for haemorrhoids and pathogenesis implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delayed diagnosis of cancer using conventional diagnostic modalities needs to be addressed to reduce the mortality rate of cancer.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research method involved a survey, and the research tool was a survey questionnaire distributed by a research agency. The target-amount selection procedure was applied and the sample structure corresponds to the structure of the Polish population with respect to the studied features. The survey sample included 1000 respondents. Findings: The studied population (of Polish consumers) were less willing to pay with cash during the pandemic than beforehand. This is related with avoiding contact with cash, as well as easy documentation of transactions, increasing their transparency. During the pandemic Polish consumers were more willing to shop at Polish online shops or retail services (e.g. Allegro) than foreign ones (e.g., AliExpress). However, the study shows that Polish customers are more cautious in their shopping decisions during the pandemic, being afraid to lose financial liquidity. Practical Implications: The pandemic led to landslide changes in consumer behaviours and habits. Identification of the current shape of Polish customers' attitudes to cashless transactions and their perception of the associated risk of Covid-19 infection is important for all market entities related directly or indirectly to such transactions. Nowadays, it is difficult to even think of a business with no such needs. Originality/Value: The study presented in the paper is original because there was no research on cashless payments in relation to shopping risk.

Tonal stability has been linked to emotion, yet systematic investigations of the associations between the hierarchy of melodic scale-degrees and perceived emotional valence are lacking. Here, we examined such associations in three experiments, in musicians and in non-musicians. We used an explicit task, in which participants matched probe tones following key-establishing sequences to facial expressions ranging from sad to happy, and an implicit speeded task, a variant of the Implicit Association Test. Stabler scale-degrees were associated with more positive valence in all experiments, for both musicians and nonmusicians. This notwithstanding, results significantly differed from those of a comparable goodness-of-fit task, suggesting that perceived tonal valence is not reducible to tonal fit. Comparisons of the explicit and implicit measures suggest that associations of tonality and emotional valence may rely on two distinct mechanisms, one mediated by conceptual musical knowledge and conscious decisional processes, the other - largely by non-conceptual and involuntary processes. The joint experimental paradigms introduced here may help mapping additional connotative meanings, both emotional and cross-modal, embedded in tonal structure, thus suggesting how extra-musical meanings are conveyed to listeners through musical syntax.","output":"Do Picardy thirds smile?

In this work, we develop a calculation model based on the combination of the electromagnetic theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the impact of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the heat transfer between nanoparticles and the surrounding medium in gold and silver nanofluids. It is found that the LSPR-induced enhanced electric field (EEF) can obviously reduce the interfacial thermal resistance to promote the heat transfer process, especially in silver nanofluids. The results reveal that the movement of water molecules can be violently perturbed by the EEF to overcome the binding force of nanoparticles, and therefore the energy transfer process in water molecules can be obviously enhanced. The effect of EEF is significant, especially in the initial heating stages when the temperature of the nanoparticles is relatively low. When the silver nanoparticle temperature is 400 K, the relative reduction ratio of the interfacial thermal resistance can reach 19.0% under the effect of the LSPR-induced EEF. The results also indicate that two different energy conversion mechanisms: photothermal and photoexcited electric-field enhancement are likely to coexist and jointly impact the heat transfer process in plasmonic nanofluids, and the effect of the latter cannot be neglected. This work provides some new insights for a deeper understanding of the light-induced heat transfer process in plasmonic nanofluids.","output":"A Molecular Dynamics Analysis on Interfacial Thermal Resistance between Particle and Medium in Light-Induced Heat Transfer of Plasmonic Nanofluid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we present the first insights into the as yet unexamined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary housing market in Poland, with a focus on Warsaw, which is the largest real estate market in the country.

Therefore, laboratory tests were carried out to examine the susceptibility of ten rice brands to rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), infestation under temperature and relative humidity of 25  2 C and 75  5%, respectively. The specific objectives of the study were to identify some commercially available rice brands with resistance to S. oryzae, by determining whether brand difference influences insect body weight at emergence and whether infestation is related to brand palatability and appearance. The ten brands used for the study were royale stallion, Mama royale, parboiled rice, Mama gold, white rice, Super eagle, Indian rice, champion rice, Abakiliki rice and Mama Africa, and standard methods were used to achieve the objectives. The indices measured were F(1) progeny emergence, grain weight loss and frass accumulation. RESULTS: The results showed that Abakiliki rice was poor in both palatability and appearance, whereas Super eagle was the most palatable and white rice was visually excellent. The results further showed that no brand was resistant to infestation and damage by S. oryzae. Males that were bred on the different rice brands did not differ in weight at emergence, but the weight of females at emergence was influenced by brand difference, and this suggests that female insects are more sensitive to brand difference at weight gain. CONCLUSION: Palatability and appearance were important in the susceptibility of rice brands to S. oryzae. The proliferation of diverse genotypes of rice (branded) with enhanced resistance to S. oryzae should be strongly encouraged to reduce susceptibility and increase rice security.","output":"Susceptibility of ten rice brands to weevil, Sitophilus oryzae L.

Results: Of 1193 invited students, 543 (45.5%) completed the survey. 35% of those participated in the g-mentoring and 7% in the e-mentoring. 59% did not participate in any program. More e-mentees than g-mentees and nonparticipants reported clinically unproblematic levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. The majority of students (55%) was somewhat worried about the impact of the pandemic on their study situation. Regarding digital teaching students did not feel overburdened by the lack of a fixed schedule and structure, e-mentees even less than g-mentees and nonparticipants. Both g-mentees and nonparticipants were significantly more appreciative of the possible repeated use of the digital teaching materials than e-mentees (both groups M=5.7 vs. M=5.4 in e-mentees, p=.045). Conclusion: The results indicate that while students feel substantially burdened by the situation and the majority worries about the impact of the pandemic on their studies, they also seem to cope well with the digital course format. Study motivation during COVID-19 decreased among the majority of students with and without mentoring. These aspects may be important to address by medical schools interested in developing effective interventions to support students during a pandemic and continuous online teaching.","output":"Perception of the study situation and mental burden during the COVID-19 pandemic among undergraduate medical students with and without mentoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implantation of a biomaterial quickly initiates a tissue repair program initially characterized by a neutrophil influx. During the acute inflammatory response, neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and secrete soluble signals to modulate the tissue environment. In this work, we evaluated chloroquine diphosphate, an antimalarial with immunomodulatory and antithrombotic effects, as an electrospun biomaterial additive to regulate neutrophil-mediated inflammation. Electrospinning of polydioxanone was optimized for rapid chloroquine elution within 1 h, and acute neutrophil-biomaterial interactions were evaluated in vitro with fresh human peripheral blood neutrophils at 3 and 6 h before quantifying the release of NETs and secretion of inflammatory and regenerative factors. Our results indicate that chloroquine suppresses NET release in a biomaterial surface areaCdependent manner at the early time point, whereas it modulates signal secretion at both early and late time points. More specifically, chloroquine elution down-regulates interleukin 8 (IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase nine secretion while up-regulating hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and IL-22 secretion, suggesting a potential shift toward a resolving neutrophil phenotype. Our novel repurposing of chloroquine as a biomaterial additive may therefore have synergistic, immunomodulatory effects that are advantageous for biomaterial-guided in situ tissue regeneration applications.","output":"Electrospun Polydioxanone Loaded With Chloroquine Modulates Template-Induced NET Release and Inflammatory Responses From Human Neutrophils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the study by Siyu Chen and colleagues.

Despite the great efforts that have been made in this field since the appearance of COVID-19 (2019), the field still suffers from two drawbacks. First, the number of available X-ray scans labeled as COVID-19-infected is relatively small. Second, all the works that have been carried out in the field are separate; there are no unified data, classes, and evaluation protocols. In this work, based on public and newly collected data, we propose two X-ray COVID-19 databases, which are three-class COVID-19 and five-class COVID-19 datasets. For both databases, we evaluate different deep learning architectures. Moreover, we propose an Ensemble-CNNs approach which outperforms the deep learning architectures and shows promising results in both databases. In other words, our proposed Ensemble-CNNs achieved a high performance in the recognition of COVID-19 infection, resulting in accuracies of 100% and 98.1% in the three-class and five-class scenarios, respectively. In addition, our approach achieved promising results in the overall recognition accuracy of 75.23% and 81.0% for the three-class and five-class scenarios, respectively.

Routine clinical diagnosis, however, is mostly performed by PCR - based assays that do not discriminate between infectious and non-virus. Herein, we aimed to determine the correlation between positive viral cultures and either PCR positivity, the Cycle Threshold (Ct) or the number of viral copies. MethodsA systematic electronic literature search was performed and studies that reported both viral SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR-based assays were included. A separate search for samples from blood, urine, stool, breast milk and tears were performed. To convert Ct values reported in the reviewed studies were to viral genomic copies, calibration experiments with four different reaction performed, using quantified RNA molecules. ResultsA total 540 articles were reviewed, and 38 studies were included in this review. Out of 276 positive-culture of non-severe patients, 272 (98.55%) were negative ten days after symptoms onset, while PCR assays remained positive for up to 67 days. In severely ill or immunocompromised patients positive-culture was obtained up to 32 days and out of 168 cultures, 31 (18.45%) stayed positive after day 10. In non-severe patients, in Ct value greater than 30 only 10.8% were still culture-positive while in Ct >35 it was nearly universally negative. The minimal calculated number of viral genome copies in culture-positive sample was 2.5 x 103 copies / mL. These findings were similar in immunocompromised patients. Recovering positive culture from non-respiratory samples was sporadically obtained in stool or urine samples. Conversion of Ct values to viral genome copies showed variability between different PCR assays and highlighted the need to standardize reports to correctly compare results obtained in different laboratories. ConclusionDuring the pandemic phase, non-severe COVID-19 patients who are recovering and are not immuno-suppressed, can be regarded as non-infectious, within 10 days from symptom onset, or with Ct value greater than 35 (or a calculated viral load lower than 1.2x103 copies / mL). These findings have important implications for recovering patients and asymptomatic patients, with respect to isolation criteria. The conversion of Cq values to viral genome copies described herein may be useful in future work, enabling a more standardized comparison between results reported in different studies from different laboratories.","output":"Evaluation of the relationship between quantitative PCR results and cell culturing of SARS2-CoV with respect to symptoms onset and Viral load - a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses.

For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited) where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread.

SARS-CoV-2 viral entry depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric viral Spike protein (Spike-RBD) and the dimeric human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. While it is clear that strategies to block the Spike/ACE2 interaction are promising as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, our current understanding is insufficient for the rational design of maximally effective therapeutic molecules. Here, we investigated the mechanism of Spike/ACE2 interaction by characterizing the binding affinity and kinetics of different multimeric forms of recombinant ACE2 and Spike-RBD domain. We also engineered ACE2 into a split Nanoluciferase-based reporter system to probe the conformational landscape of Spike-RBDs in the context of the Spike trimer. Interestingly, a dimeric form of ACE2, but not monomeric ACE2, binds with high affinity to Spike and blocks viral entry in pseudotyped virus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays. We show that dimeric ACE2 interacts with an RBD on Spike with limited intra-Spike avidity, which nonetheless contributes to the affinity of this interaction. Additionally, we demonstrate that a proportion of Spike can simultaneously interact with multiple ACE2 dimers, indicating that more than one RBD domain in a Spike trimer can adopt an ACE2-accessible up conformation. Our findings have significant implications on the design strategies of therapeutic molecules that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction.

However, there have been few studies designed to specifically address that issue. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore how the red panda, an iconic endangered habitat specialist, behaves when faced with disturbances and habitat fragmentation. In particular, we attempted to examine the effect of anthropogenic disturbances and fragmentation on home-range size, activity patterns, and recursion. METHODS: Using GPS telemetry we monitored 10 red pandas and documented disturbances using camera trapping for one year in eastern Nepal. We performed spatial analysis, analysed activity patterns and evaluated the effect of habitat fragmentation and disturbances on home-range size and residence time using Linear Mixed Models. RESULTS: Home-range size increased in areas with low availability of forest cover whilst home ranges were smaller in areas with a high road density. Red pandas spent more time in large habitat patches away from roads and cattle stations. Crossing rates suggested that roads acted as a barrier for movement across their habitat. Red pandas also partitioned their activity to minimize interactions with disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Red pandas seem to make a trade-off to co-exist in human-dominated landscapes which may have adverse long-term effects on their survival. This indicates that current patterns of habitat fragmentation and forest exploitation may be adversely affecting red panda conservation efforts and that landscape-scale effects should be considered when planning conservation actions.

In order to take informed decisions in a fully rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible. Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime to a critical one. A new sequential test-referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic sequential test)-is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off between average decision delay [Formula: see text] and risk [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is inversely proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary restrictive measures. To quantify risk, in this paper we adopt as its proxy the average occurrence rate of false alarms, in that a false alarm risks unnecessary social and economic disruption. Ideally, the decision mechanism should react as quick as possible for a given level of risk. We find that all the countries share the same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales exponentially with the delay, [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of countermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to 3 weeks, much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident. Strictly from the quickest-detection perspective adopted in this paper, it turns out that countermeasures against the second epidemic wave have not always been taken in a timely manner. The developed tool can be used to support decisions at different geographic scales (regions, cities, local areas, etc.), levels of risk, instantiations of controlled/critical regime, and is general enough to be applied to different pandemic time-series.

It deconstructs the mechanisms by which the federal income tax system operates to affect the transmission of income shocks to consumption, and therefore, consumption inequality. To this end, it links micro and macro models of the distribution of income and consumption to changes in the federal income tax system. We find important changes in the types of income shocks to which consumers are insured or not, as well as the extent to which tax policy contributes to insuring consumers from these shocks. Importantly, we find that without decomposing the tax system into the three mechanisms outlined in the model, economists might have erroneously inferred that the role of tax policy as a mechanism for consumption insurance did not change over time. We also find that tax policy changes have disproportional effects across socioeconomic groups, and that this contributes to increasing inequality.","output":"Taxation and inequality: Active and passive channels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-cell RNA sequencing of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from COVID-19 patients has enabled us to examine gene expression changes of human tissue in response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

We investigated the association of initial radiologic characteristics obtained at admission with clinical outcomes in patients with avian influenza H7N9 pneumonia. METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, clinical findings, radiologic appearance and scores of the affected lung parenchyma were compared between survivor group (n = 15) and mortality group (n = 7). Two radiologic scores were calculated, one using chest radiography and one using CT. Follow-up CT scans at discharge were analyzed in 12 patients of the survival group. RESULTS: All the patients in mortality group developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation, while in the survival group 33% (5/15) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (P<0.05) and 27% (4/15) required mechanical ventilation (P<0.05). The mean radiographic and CT scores of the mortality group were 50% higher compared to the survival group (P<0.05). ROC analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.738 for the radiographic score with an optimal cutoff value of a score of 19 for prediction of mortality, with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 67%, and an area under curve of 0.833 for the CT score with an optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 21 for prediction of mortality, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 73%.

In this study, we found that feline calicivirus (FCV) infection promotes the degradation of endogenous and exogenous mRNAs and induces host gene shutoff, which results in global inhibition of host protein synthesis. Screening assay revealed that proteinase-polymerase (PP) is a most effective factor in reducing mRNA expression. Moreover, differently virulent strains of FCV PP could induce mRNA degradation. Further, we found that the key sites of the PP protein required for its proteinase activity are also essential for its shutoff activity, but also required for viral replication. The mechanism analysis showed that PP mainly targets Pol II-transcribed RNA in a ribosome-, 5'cap- and 3' poly(A) tail-independent manner. Moreover, the purified GST-PP fusion protein exhibits ribonuclease activity in vitro in assays using GFP RNA transcribed in vitro as substrates in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. Finally, PP-induced shutoff requires host Xrn1 to complete further RNA degradation. This study provides a newly discovered strategy in which FCV PP protein induces host gene shutoff by promoting the degradation of host mRNAs.ImportanceVirus infection-induced shutoff is the result of targeted or global manipulation of cellular gene expression and leads to efficient viral replication and immune evasion. FCV is a highly contagious pathogen that persistently infects cats. It is unknown how FCV blocks the host immune response and persistently exists in cats. In this study, we found that FCV infection promotes the degradation of host mRNAs and induces host gene shutoff via a common strategy. Further, PP protein for different FCV strains is a key factor that enhances mRNA degradation. An in vitro assay showed that the GST-PP fusion protein possess ribonuclease activity in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins.

Investigation of the potential association of the spread of the COVID-19 infection with climate or ambient air pollution could lead to the development of preventive strategies for disease control. To examine this association, we conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 28 geographical areas of Japan with documented outbreaks of COVID-19. We analyzed data obtained from March 13 to April 6, 2020, before the Japanese government declared a state of emergency. The results revealed that the epidemic growth of COVID-19 was significantly associated with increase in daily temperature or sunshine hours. This suggests that an increase in person-to-person contact due to increased outing activities on a warm and/or sunny day might promote the transmission of COVID-19. Our results also suggested that short-term exposure to suspended particles might influence respiratory infections caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Further research by well-designed or well-controlled study models is required to ascertain this effect.

The reason why so many clinically diagnosed cases appeared was not clear. Methods: All data of new cases in China were acquired from WHO situation reports. Linear fitting was used to infer the ability to detect COVID-19 infections. Primer-BLAST and nucleotide blast were applied to check the specificity of primers. Expression data of human mRNA in different tissues was obtained from Human Protein Atlas. Finding: Based on the data and analysis of changes of new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases, it was inferred that there were many false-negative results in all clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province. There were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of COVID-19.

In the present study, we show that alternative splicing is an essential feature of placental diseases, affecting 1060 and 1409 genes in PE vs controls and IUGR vs controls, respectively, many of those involved in placental function. While in IUGR placentas, alternative splicing affects genes specifically related to pregnancy, in preeclamptic placentas, it impacts a mix of genes related to pregnancy and brain diseases.

We correlate these variations with genetic variants to define splicing Quantitative Trait Loci (sQTL) in the subset of the 48 genes the most strongly alternatively spliced in placental diseases.

No known risk factor for CVST could be identified. He improved with anticoagulation and antiepileptic therapy. He was subsequently transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Although Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection has been previously associated with thrombotic complications, these mostly relate to the pulmonary vasculature.

Surf session analysis is often performed with commercially available devices. However, most of them seem insufficient considering the surfers needs, by displaying a low number of features, being inaccurate, invasive or not adequate for all surfer levels. Despite the fact that performing manoeuvres is the ultimate goal of surfing, there are no available solutions that enable the identification and characterization of such events. In this work, we propose a novel method to detect manoeuvre events during wave riding periods resorting solely to the inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. The proposed method was able to correctly identify over 95% of all the manoeuvres in the dataset (172 annotated manoeuvres), while achieving a precision of up to 80%, using a session-independent validation approach. These findings demonstrate the suitability and validity of the proposed solution for identification of manoeuvre events in real-world conditions, evidencing a high market potential.","output":"Real-Time Surf Manoeuvres Detection Using Smartphones Inertial Sensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The UK undergraduate medicine curriculum provides insufficient opportunities for medical students to explore the field of wilderness medicine, despite interest in the area. The student-led Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society devised a low-cost wilderness medicine teaching weekend that can be replicated at other institutions. METHODS: The weekend course consisted of small-group lessons introducing the roles of the expedition doctor and expedition leader and the assessment and management of acute conditions in remote environments. This was followed by a 3-station circuit to teach the principles of casualty triage, splinting, and construction of rope stretchers. These skills were then practiced in simulations in which participants rotated roles as care providers and patients. Participant confidence was compared before the course and immediately on course completion using the related-samples Wilcoxon signed-ranks test with significance accepted at P<0.05. Usefulness of course content and perceptions of learning were also assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-one medical students attended the wilderness teaching weekend and completed the structured feedback questionnaires. Participants rated the course highly in terms of usefulness of course content (meanSD=18.31.9, range=12-20) and perceptions of learning (meanSD=37.62.6, range=31-40), with 92% of participants \\"strongly agreeing\\" that the course was of high quality. There was an improvement in perceived confidence after course completion (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that a teaching program consisting of structured, low-cost \\"teaching weekends\\" is a potential solution to the lack of centralized national wilderness medicine teaching and can be integrated, with minimal disruption, into the undergraduate curriculum.","output":"Wilderness Medicine Simulation-Based Teaching Program for Medical Students in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stroke experts discuss developments and challenges associated with stroke care, including the need to improve post-discharge services and the emergence of COVID-19-related stroke.","output":"Managing stroke through COVID-19 and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gut microbiota plays an essential role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and affects drug responses. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive and urgent to elucidate to explore the pathology and clinical treatment of RA. Therefore, we selected methotrexate (MTX) as an example of RA drugs to explore the interactions between the gut microbiota and drug responses and obtain an in-depth understanding of their correlation from the perspective of the metabolic capability of gut microbiota on drug metabolism. We identified 2,654 proteins and the corresponding genes involved in MTX metabolism and then profiled their abundances in the gut microbiome datasets of four cohorts. We found that the gut microbiota harbored various genes involved in MTX metabolism in healthy individuals and RA patients. Interestingly, the number of genes involved in MTX metabolism was not significantly different between response (R) and non-response (NR) groups to MTX, but the gene composition in the microbial communities significantly differed between these two groups. Particularly, several models were built based on clinical information, as well as data on the gene, taxonomical, and functional biomarkers by using the random forest algorithm and then validated. Our findings provide bases for clinical management not only of RA but also other gut microbiomeCrelated diseases. First, it suggests that the potential metabolic capability of gut microbiota on drug metabolism is important because they affect drug efficiency; as such, clinical treatment strategies should incorporate the gene compositions of gut microbial communities, in particular genes involved in drug metabolism. Second, a suitable model can be developed to determine hosts responses to drugs before clinical treatment.","output":"The Potential of Gut Microbiota Metabolic Capability to Detect Drug Response in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: HIV outcomes centre primarily around clinical markers with limited focus on patient-reported outcomes. With a global trend towards capturing the outcomes that matter most to patients, there is agreement that standardizing the definition of value in HIV care is key to their incorporation. This study aims to address the lack of routine, standardized data in HIV care. METHODS: An international working group (WG) of 37 experts and patients, and a steering group (SG) of 18 experts were convened from 14 countries. The project team (PT) identified outcomes by conducting a literature review, screening 1979 articles and reviewing the full texts of 547 of these articles. Semi-structured interviews and advisory groups were performed with the WG, SG and people living with HIV to add to the list of potentially relevant outcomes. The WG voted via a modified Delphi process - informed by six Zoom calls - to establish a core set of outcomes for use in clinical practice. RESULTS: From 156 identified outcomes, consensus was reached to include three patient-reported outcomes, four clinician-reported measures and one administratively reported outcome; standardized measures were included. The WG also reached agreement to measure 22 risk-adjustment variables. This outcome set can be applied to any person living with HIV aged > 18 years.

Contrary to previous assumptions that GBCAs are stable throughout the water cycle, they can degrade. The stability of GBCAs depends largely on their organic ligands, but also on the physicochemical conditions. There is specific concern regarding UV end-of-pipe water treatments, which may degrade GBCAs. Degradation products in drinking water supplies can increase the risk of adverse health effects. This is of particular relevance where the raw water for drinking water production has a higher proportion of recycled wastewater. GBCAs concentrations in aquatic systems, often referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium, are determined using a variety of calculation methods. Where anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations are low, the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty. The current COVID-19 crisis will, in the short-term, drastically decrease the input of GBCAs to freshwater systems. Temporal variations in anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations in river water can be used to better understand river-aquifer interactions and groundwater flow velocities.

The aim of this study was to explore the financial burden of cancer among older Mexican adults and their relatives, as well as factors that might mitigate such burden. METHODS: This mixed-methods study included patients age 65 years and older with the 10 most common malignancies in Mexico and 3-24 months from diagnosis at two cancer centers in Mexico City and their relatives. For the quantitative component, patients and relatives answered the Spanish version of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Financial Well-Being Scale. Patients completed the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity-Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (COST-FACIT) scale and a 3-month, self-reported cost diary. For the qualitative component, focused interviews were used to explore the individual experiences of patients and their relatives. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients and their relatives were included, of whom 45% had stage IV disease. On the COST-FACIT scale, 9% reported no FT, 52% mild FT, 39% moderate FT, and 0% severe FT. The mean Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Financial Well-Being Scale score was 45.2, with 78% reporting poor financial well-being (score  50).

This study aimed to identify and follow potentially infected healthcare workers in one hospital in order to develop an epidemiological baseline for COVID-19 infection and spread rates in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was conducted between 1 April and 30 June 2020 at a single Belgian hospital. Healthcare workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included. Participants underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and analysis of blood samples for antibody response at different timepoints (day 0, 7, 14 and day 30 or 60). Patient exposures, symptoms, and disease progression were collected. RESULTS Of a total of 150 healthcare workers with symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 31% (47) tested positive for the virus by NP swab. Of the 47 participants with positive NP swabs, 66% also had positive IgG serology. Of the 99 participants with negative NP swabs who underwent blood sample collection, 5% had positive IgG serology results. Of the 29 participants who presented with at least 3 major symptoms, 15 (52%) had positive NP swabs and 14 (48%) had positive serology.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of troponin I levels for mortality in geriatric patients transferred to the intensive care unit for COVID-19 pneumonia according to age group. Material and Methods: Seventy-four patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were grouped according to age (Group 1:65-74 years, Group 2: 75-84 years, and Group 3: >= 85 years) and retrospectively analyzed. Demographics, clinical findings, laboratory results upon admission to the intensive care unit, and outcomes were compared among the groups. Predictive value of troponin I levels upon admission to intensive care unit (Troponin Iicu), difference in troponin levels between general wards and intensive care unit (Troponin Idiff), C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, procalcitonin, and D-dimer levels for mortality were also investigated. Results: The mortality rate was 74.3% for the patients overall, and increased, albeit insignificantly, with increasing age. Neither Troponin Iicu nor Troponin Idiff was predictive for mortality for any of the age groups or for the patients overall. Ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein levels were predictive for mortality for patients overall (p= 0.016, p= 0.001, p= 0.013, and p < 0.001, respectively).

The time course of lymphocyte reconstitution with regard to the overall and donor-reactive T-cell receptor (TCR) specificity remains elusive. METHODS/DESIGN: Five kidney transplant recipients receiving a 1.5-mg/kg ATLG induction therapy over 7 days and five patients with 2  20 mg basiliximab induction therapy were longitudinally monitored. Peripheral mononuclear cells were sampled pre-transplant and within 1, 3, and 12 months after transplantation, and their overall and donor-reactive TCRs were determined by next-generation sequencing of the TCR beta CDR3 region. Overall TCR repertoire diversity, turnover, and donor specificity were assessed at all timepoints. RESULTS: We observed an increase in the donor-reactive TCR repertoire after transplantation in patients, independent of lymphocyte counts or induction therapy. Donor-reactive CD4 T-cell frequency in the ATLG group increased from 1.14% + -0.63 to 2.03% + -1.09 and from 0.93% + -0.63 to 1.82% + -1.17 in the basiliximab group in the first month. Diversity measurements of the entire T-cell repertoire and repertoire turnover showed no statistical difference between the two induction therapies. The difference in mean clonality between groups was 0.03 and 0.07 pre-transplant in the CD4 and CD8 fractions, respectively, and was not different over time (CD4: F(1.45, 11.6) = 0.64 p = 0.496; CD8: F(3, 24) = 0.60 p = 0.620). The mean difference in R20, a metric for immune dominance, between groups was -0.006 in CD4 and 0.001 in CD8 T-cells and not statistically different between the groups and subsequent timepoints (CD4: F(3, 24) = 0.85 p = 0.479; CD8: F(1.19, 9.52) = 0.79 p = 0.418). CONCLUSION: Reduced-dose ATLG induction therapy led to an initial lymphodepletion followed by an increase in the percentage of donor-reactive T-cells after transplantation similar to basiliximab induction therapy. Furthermore, reduced-dose ATLG did not change the overall TCR repertoire in terms of a narrowed or skewed TCR repertoire after immune reconstitution, comparable to non-depletional induction therapy.","output":"Effects of Reduced-Dose Anti-Human T-Lymphocyte Globulin on Overall and Donor-Specific T-Cell Repertoire Reconstitution in Sensitized Kidney Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global threat which continues to accompany SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global response which adopts lockdown and stays home policy as means of curtailing its spread.

Methods We evaluated whether some specific post-mortem features are observed in these patients and if these changes are related to the presence of the virus in different organs. Complete macroscopic and microscopic autopsies were performed on different organs in 17 COVID-19 non-survivors. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in lung samples and with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in lung and other organs. Results Pulmonary findings revealed early-stage diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 15 out of 17 patients and microthrombi in small lung arteries in 11 patients. Late-stage DAD, atypical pneumocytes and/or acute pneumonia were also observed. Four lung infarcts, two acute myocardial infarctions and one ischemic enteritis were observed. There was no evidence of myocarditis, hepatitis or encephalitis. Kidney evaluation revealed the presence of hemosiderin in tubules or pigmented casts in most patients. Spongiosis and vascular congestion were the most frequently encountered brain lesions. No specific SARS-CoV-2 lesions were observed in any organ. IHC revealed positive cells with a heterogeneous distribution in the lungs of 11 of the 17 (65%) patients; RT-PCR yielded a wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues, with 8 patients showing viral presence in all tested organs (i.e. lung, heart, spleen, liver, colon, kidney and brain).

Continual molecular epidemiology is critical to understand the evolutionary processes maintaining the success of the BA viruses. We analysed 735 G gene sequences from samples collected from paediatric patients in Kilifi, Kenya, between 2003 and 2017. The virus population comprised of several genetically distinct variants (n = 56) co-circulating within and between epidemics. In addition, there was consistent seasonal fluctuations in relative genetic diversity. Amino acid changes increasingly accumulated over the surveillance period including two residues (N178S and Q180R) that mapped to monoclonal antibody 2D10 epitopes, as well as addition of putative N-glycosylation sequons. Further, switching and toggling of amino acids within and between epidemics was observed.

One potential area of concern is whether and how the pandemic has dampened these individuals' ability to engage in the resilient practices that are so vital to their wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: Within the unique and understudied context of a developing economy facing the strain of an international pandemic, this study sought to expand our theoretical understanding of the individual and socio-ecological predictors of whether child protective services professionals engage in resilient behaviors. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Three hundred and nine professionals working in child protection related fields (e.g., psychologists, social workers, professors, pediatricians, nurses, and other clinicians). METHODS: Participants were surveyed as to their demographics, current work conditions, their engagement in resilient behaviors, and potential individual and socio-ecological predictors of those behaviors. RESULTS: Both job support for and individuals' beliefs of the importance of resilient behaviors predicted their engagement in such behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Child protection professionals' resilience must be fostered by socio-ecological contexts, such as their workplace and employers, and additional supports are needed during the trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Brazilian Child Protection Professionals' Resilient Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin: Los cambios en las rutinas cotidianas como resultado de las medidas mitigantes implementadas frente a la pandemia de COVID-19 representan un desafo para la poblacin latinoamericana para conservar su bienestar general.

When threats to the physician's safety were identified, these concerns were escalated to leadership and addressed when possible. When threats to well-being were identified, behavioral health team members provided supportive listening, and, if indicated, provided referral information for appropriate treatment resources.

We present outcome ('recovered', 'isolated' or 'death') risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over 'early' datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. METHOD: Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used 'country', 'age' and 'gender' as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient's 'disease' history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. RESULTS: The use of a patient's 'disease' history improves the prediction of 'death' by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent's 'disease' history performed poorly in test predictions. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient's 'disease' history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries.","output":"Maintaining proper health records improves machine learning predictions for novel 2019-nCoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Myocarditis and pericarditis are adverse events of special interest after vaccination with mRNA vaccines. This rapid systematic review examined incidence rates of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination, and the presentation and clinical course of cases. Design: Rapid systematic review Data sources: Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched from October 2020 to October 6, 2021; reference lists and grey literature (to Oct 21, 2021). Review methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and large population-based/multisite observational studies and surveillance data reporting on myocarditis or pericarditis in people of any age after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine; systematic reviews of case series. A single reviewer completed screening and another verified 50% of exclusions, using a machine-learning program to prioritize records. A second reviewer verified all exclusions at full text, data extractions, and (for incidence) risk of bias assessments using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 and Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Certainty of evidence ratings for incidence were based on team consensus using GRADE. Patient partners provided key messages from their interpretations of the findings. Results: 3457 titles/abstracts and 159 full texts were screened. For incidence rates we included 7 RCTs (n=3732 to 44,325) and 22 large observational studies/data sources using passive (n=10) and active (n=12) surveillance; for case presentation, we included 11 case series published as articles and three based on publicly available websites (n=12,636 cases). Mainly due to imprecision, the RCTs provided very low certainty evidence for incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. From observational data, the incidence of myocarditis following mRNA vaccines is low but probably highest in males 12-17 years (55 [7-day risk] to 134 [30-day risk] cases per million; specific to Pfizer) and 18-29 years (40 [7-day risk] to 99 [21-30 day risk]) cases per million) (Moderate certainty evidence). Incidence is lower (<20 per million) or little-to-none in older ages and across all ages of females (Low certainty). Evidence for pericarditis was of very low certainty. Among adult males under 40 years, Moderna compared with Pfizer vaccine may be associated with a small increase (<20 per million) in risk for myocarditis or (one of) myocarditis or pericarditis following vaccination (Low certainty); the evidence for youth under 18 years was very uncertain. No study examined differences in incidence based on pre-existing condition(s) or risk factors apart from age and sex. The majority of myocarditis cases involved males (often >90%) in their 20s, with a short symptom onset of 2 to 4 days after a second dose (71-100%). The majority of cases presented with chest pain/pressure and troponin elevation; a minority (<30%) had left ventricular dysfunction. Most were hospitalized ([]84%), without stays in intensive care units, for a short duration (2-4 d) and treated with anti-inflammatory and/or other supportive therapies. Almost all reports of death are from unverified cases and of unclear cause. Most cases of pericarditis were unconfirmed; for this outcome there appears to be more variation in age, sex, onset timing and rate of hospitalization. Conclusions: Incidence of myocarditis following mRNA vaccines is low but probably highest in males 12-29 years old. Existing evidence does not strongly support preference of one mRNA vaccine, even in young males. Continued active surveillance of myocarditis incidence out to 30 days from dosing is recommended with respect to i) new populations (i.e., children <12y), ii) third and subsequent doses, and iii) affected individuals receiving subsequent mRNA vaccine doses. Future research is needed to examine other risk factors and long-term effects.","output":"Myocarditis and Pericarditis following COVID-19 Vaccination: Rapid Systematic Review of Incidence, Risk Factors, and Clinical Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of STS in treating pulmonary hypertension by inhibiting the pulmonary vascular remodeling and suppressing the abnormally elevated proliferation and migration of PASMCs. However, the roles of STS on pulmonary vascular endothelium remain largely known. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of STS on pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction by using a chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (HPH) rat model, as well as in primarily cultured rat PMVECs and human ESC-ECs cell models. RESULTS: Firstly, a 21-day treatment of STS significantly prevents the disease development of HPH by normalizing the right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy, improving the cardiac output. Then, STS treatment markedly inhibits the hypoxia-induced medial wall thickening of the distal intrapulmonary arteries. Notably, STS significantly inhibits the hypoxia-induced apoptosis in both the pulmonary endothelium of HPH rats and primarily cultured PMVECs, through the stabilization of BMPR2 protein and protection of the diminished BMP9-BMPR2-Smad1/5/9 signaling pathway. In mechanism, STS treatment retrieves the hypoxic downregulation of BMPR2 by stabilizing the BMPR2 protein, inhibiting the BMPR2 protein degradation via lysosome system, and promoting the plasma membrane localization of BMPR2, all of which together reinforcing the BMP9-induced signaling transduction in both PMVECs and human ESC-ECs. However, these effects are absent in hESC-ECs expressing heterozygous dysfunctional BMPR2 protein (BMPR2+/R899X). CONCLUSION: STS may exert anti-apoptotic roles, at least partially, via induction of the BMP9-BMPR2-Smad1/5/9 signaling transduction in pulmonary endothelium and PMVECs.","output":"Sodium Tanshinone IIA Sulfonate Enhances the BMP9-BMPR2-Smad1/5/9 Signaling Pathway in Rat Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cells and Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the collective trauma caused by COVID-19 global pandemic, it is more important than ever that schools look for ways to create safe, trauma-sensitive, and restorative learning environments.

Main funding source(s): Dutch Heart Foundation - senior E-Dekker grant Physical activity and sedentary behaviour in cardiovascular disease patients during the COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands; a longitudinal cohort study BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that the COVID-19 lockdown caused a more inactive lifestyle, but it is unknown whether these acute effects persist over time. We prospectively evaluated changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviour among chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients during the first-wave COVID-19 lockdown and aimed to identify factors associated with physical inactivity. METHODS: 1,565 CVD patients were included and baseline physical activity and sedentary behaviour were assessed using validated questionnaires at 5 weeks after the initiation of the Dutch lockdown (March 2020). Follow-up measures were collected every subsequent 4 weeks until July 2020. Multivariate mixed model analyses were performed to identify whether age, gender, CVD subtype, lockdown adherence and mental health factors impacted changes in physical (in)activity. RESULTS: Patients were 67 (interquartile range [60, 73]) years, mostly male (73%) and primarily diagnosed with myocardial infarction (48%) or angina pectoris (18%). Daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 143 minutes (95% confidence interval (CI) 137; 148) at baseline, with almost no changes during follow-up on a group level (+8.0 (95%CI -1.1; 17.0); +11.2 (95%CI 1.9; 20.5) and +8.0 (95%CI -1.5; 17.5) min/day after 4, 8 and 12 weeks, respectively).Female gender (-40.7 (95%CI -48.5; -33.0) min/day); heart failure (-23.0 (95%CI -36.5; -9.5) min/day); fear of a COVID-19 infection (-6.6 (95%CI -9.4; -3.8) min/day) and limited possibilities for physical activity (-7.4 (95%CI -10.1; -4.7) min/day) were independently associated with a decrease in physical activity. Sedentary time was 567 (95%CI 555; 578) min/day at baseline which did not change after 4 weeks (+12.1 (95%CI -6.0; 30.2) min/day) and after 8 weeks (+15.2 (95%CI -3.3; 33.8) min/day), but significantly increased after 12 weeks of follow-up (+19.0 (95%CI 0.1; 37.8) min/day). Lack of social contact (+8.4 (95%CI 2.3; 14.5); limited possibilities for physical activity (+14.7 (95%CI 8.8; 20.5) and younger age (+2.1 (95%CI 1.3; 2.8) min/day were independently associated with an increase in sedentary time. CONCLUSIONS: A time-dependent increase in daily sedentary time was observed among chronic CVD patients during the COVID-19 lockdown, whereas physical activity levels did not substantially change. Our findings highlight the need to develop and implement novel solutions to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time during (and beyond) the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in CVD patients who are female, younger, diagnosed with heart failure, have a lack of social contact, fear of COVID-19 infection and experience limited physical activity possibilities during the lockdown.","output":"Physical activity and sedentary behaviour in cardiovascular disease patients during the COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands; a longitudinal cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article in the journal Group.

We contribute to this effort by providing causal estimates of the link between increased chronic ambient pollutant concentrations and the intensity of COVID-19 disease, as measured by deaths and hospitalizations in New York City from March through August, 2020. Given concerns about unobservable characteristics that contribute to both ambient air pollutant concentrations and the impacts of COVID-19 disease, we instrument for pollutant concentrations using the time spent downwind of nearby highways and estimate key causal relationships using two-stage least squares models. The causal links between increases in concentrations of our traffic-related air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and NO) and COVID-19 deaths are much larger than the correlations presented in recent observational studies. We find that a 0.16 g/m3 increase in average ambient PM2.5 concentration leads to an approximate 30% increase in COVID-19 deaths. This is the change in concentration associated with being downwind of a nearby highway. We see that this effect is mostly driven by residents with at least 75 years of age. In addition to emphasizing the importance of searching for causal relationships, our analysis highlights the value of increasing the density of pollution-monitoring networks and suggests potential benefits of further tightening of Clean Air Act amendments, as our estimated effects occur at concentrations well below thresholds set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.","output":"The causal effects of chronic air pollution on the intensity of COVID-19 disease: Some answers are blowing in the wind"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/29.md","filePath":"doctor/29.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/29.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
